I am Ankit Kumar Singh, here i created my finalised project of near duplicate detetction with the help of research papers. 
This was a group project done with the help of my brother Aditya Singh.
The link to my brothers github profile is:
https://github.com/863aditya

Testing has been done on a very ideal datasets in which we have parsed only the paragraph tags and that were created specifically for testing purpose only , if you wish to test on some other data some minor adjustments are required.

I intend to use this analysis and assessment for research purpose and future enhancement  in my project.

While doing this project all the datasets were in the same directory as of the python files, at the time of uploading, I have separated into different files for better convenience.


If you wish to run this on your machine steps are summarised below:
1) Download this repository and extract in a new folder.
2)While executing this project, all the datasets should be in the respective directories itself.
3)create two text files with name res.txt and res1.txt for stemmed and unstemmed analysis.
4)From the folder Localhost run the python script app.py on powershell or cmd prompt.(since all the html parsing is done on the localhost server itself.)
5)Then run the python files from a powershell or command prompt.

Note: To run python scripts from powershell: open the file, press Shift+Right_click_on_mouse, then select open powershell window here,then type: 
python FILENAME.py
If the python files requires an input you should type that in the powershell itself in the next line, eg u100.xls as we used.

If you point out any funny name used for any jupyter files or python file it was just used for testing purposes and we may have missed out on some places.
