Anybody can be a star. Success which one searches for at a distant place is

Likely to be within him. If indeed you are interested in your own success, I

Will be glad to tell you a few things about it. First, remember that no one

Will ever succeed unless he sees himself as something for which he desires to

Be. To make it, most of what you need is nothing but a practical horse sense

Idea. Some labor of love, and friendly supports will help you tug your

Boat through.

Many people ride through life with less material accumulation than few

Others. They work very hard with little or nothing to show for their efforts.

They “feel” that they are “destined” to failure. Indeed the way they feel find

Expression in their lifestyle. This of course becomes a self-fulfilling

Prophecy.

One thing for sure, such people often do overlook: The “honest, hard-working

Folks have unwittingly surrounded themselves with “friends” whose

Outlooks on life is drowned in thoughts of lack, poverty, and gloomy hope.

They see no way out of any difficulty which might confront them. Due to

The tendency of their association, they turn out to think and reason like

Those “friends” with whom they associate.

“Birds of like feather fly together” is a correct figure of speech with regard

To either success or failure. If indeed you want to succeed, Do Not Overlook

The Inherent Fact That Your Association With nose Who Have Already

Been There Will Help You Tow Your Boat A Great Deal.

You cannot make a game of a big boar if you are only hunting for an ordinary

Rat. Rest assured. It will only be a waste of time associating-, with

Failures, should one falsely believe that their counsels would do him any

Good.

You can be all you want to be provided you really want to be. I wish I could

Be with you physically while you read these lines. I do also wish you and I

Would discuss these points blow by blow as you move on this road-map to

Success.

I am here to help you succeed. If this be not so, I then do not know what else

A good friend is meant for. This can only happen on mutual agreement for

Your own betterment.

Is it not time to break away from the ruts? Money may not be all the things

One would need. But it never hurts to have it when one needs it. Be patient

As we go along.

From one chapter of this book to the next, you will see the same idea

Emphasized and re-emphasized. This is a proven method, done in several

Ways just to wrap it round and round your subconscious mind for your

Overall enrichment in return.

It will also be a waste of time if you, after reading this book decides not to

Apply the idea to your own benefits. I would not like for you to buy an idea

Which you would not use. Good ideas are not meant to be kept in subconscious

Cellars as antiques. If you had done so in the past let this serve you as

Warning to retrieve them, clean them up and use them. Let this note also

Awaken your total self to the urgent need to apply every success—making

Idea obtainable from this book to your maxi mum success.

Use everyone without hesitation. Use it without economizing. Use it without

Reservation. Use it without delay. If there is any other encouragement I

Would add, it is not far from that idea with regard to your being encouraged

To make application of the idea to your problem solving need.

It is not advisable, nor desirable that you go through life like someone left

In a lonely night. I am sure, though I might not have met you except

Through this medium of contact, that you would not like, nor enjoy such a

Life condition. Therefore, see what I am giving to you, not as a “fair

Weather ally,” but a true comrade who is ready, determined, and truly

Want you to succeed; if need be, at all costs.

Life is a soccer game. Though we dribble to be cheered up, our main aim is

To score to win. I shall not only dribble to be cheered up, I must make sure

My ball reaches you. Now, accept this offer, my right hand in friendship and

My willingness to give you the right pointers essential to the spot of your

Success.

One More Thing: Remember, I can only support you with all the necessary

Encouragements a true comrade can and must give. The other side of it is

Up to you.

As we say it in one of the African ways of speaking, to someone we truly

Care for, “A man can only lead a horse to a stream, but he cannot force the

Same horse to drink from it.” The bests of all worlds are now in front of you.

It is now equally, and nothing but up to you.

The Amazing Thing:

Life is an amazing phenomenon…a grand, successful moment at that…Yes, there is a perfect time, and a total limit to everything under the sun…Indeed, there is a unique time to live, and a profound limit to the phenomenal existence.

Everything, in this blessed universe, goes even to re-assure us that there is life, and, there is also death. Yes, even with the blessed re-assurance, we are constantly reminded that, surely, the very world, in which we live, is not our blessed home.

Yes, the planet, earth, is an alien land, made of pure void. Yes, it would even be a perfect grand illusion to surely pretend that the planet, earth, would offer us a perfect home…No, it would never do so.

Really, there is a realm, a perfect place far away from the furtherest sky of human imagination…It is a wonderful realm…a blessed sky of human home…It is a realm built by the power of Divine Love, word, power, and even with the best part of his heavenly imagination… It is the very home of the blessed, the streets of angels, and even the perfect place for the righteous human soul. Yes, the home is eternal home; however, it is not every soul, now alive in this planet, earth, that would go there.

True, God and the devil are tele-active, in their opposite ways…the devil will tele-create some problems for you; but, God will tele-guide the solutions…The devil will tele-send a new set of awesome questions; but, God will tele-provide the answers, to rectify them.

The devil will tele-terrorize you, and your dreams; but, God will teleadvise, and tele-comfort you…Even as the devil would tele-scare, and horrorize you, a good, and a loving God would tele-amaze, and lead you to success.

Tele-trust in God, even though you do not, at present, have the power, nor the means to tele-view Him with your mortal eyes…Yes, at least, you can tele-talk to Him, and tele-understand His love,His dream, and even His desire for you…Yes, it is His paramount dream to lead you to the rivers of success…It is His passion to tele-guide your path.

Yes, it is within His tele-heavenly imagination to tele-direct you, even in His paths, and ways…Yes, God is ready, even tele-ready, to crown your light of victory with His DIVINE EMBODIMENT, even as you teletrust Him…He will neither mis-lead you, nor forsake you in the terrors, and, in the dark-heat of uncertainties.

Yes, trust in God; yes, I say, trust also in these words of inspiration.

God will tele-prompt your reason, and even your reasoning potentials, with the power, and right light of enlightenment.

EVEN MORE AMAZING: Believe it, or not, what you just opened has power enough to turn your present life condition inside-out.

Really, everyone has that special 'something' which will 'enable' him make giant strides to amazing success. The 'thing' you have in your hand is a new tool.

You will use it to unlock doors after doors into an amazing system. It is the system which makes things to happen everywhere.

You must have guessed; that very correctly, what the name of the "icon" is.

The fact that you are holding and looking at the condensed pack of the system clearly demonstrate a new you, you are about to become.

It is the very system which made you what you are even now.

Many years ago, the Supreme Being used that very system to make all things you and I call the "Gifts of Nature." Parents use it to rear their children.

Teachers use it to teach their pupils. Preachers use it to preach to their members.

And, in every sphere of life, the power of the system is self-evident.

With "words" the scriptures told us "heaven and earth were made." Now that you have been reminded the name of the system; you cannot doubt the amazing power in a "word".

A Greater Surprise The prudent fact is attainable. Indeed you are one of the many a proven evidence in that you are uniquely endowed with amazing talents. Many people see themselves as "something" lacking in their systems. While in truth the unlacking "something" is amazingly far beyond their highest points of imagination. Think twice. Are you one of those? You are bound to succeed if that negative self-evaluation would be kicked away from your self-evaluation. You have now known the course of poverty plaguing many; as well as the prompt solution to it.

Use everything it takes to make a success. Use them generously The things that make for success can either be in intangible or in tangible forms. Use them in a way that either by implication or explication, would not limit Success-potentials of other people. It is this fondest crux of conceptualization, Lion that would make you not only unique, but also remarkably distinct from every other person you have ever met or known.

In this light, it is advisable that you make use of it to attain your highest goods and desirable goals.

Forward To Success: Since you have the "talent," you are equally able to deliver. If you are able to deliver; then let your talented efforts merit all desirable prerogatives.

Sometimes the gap between success and failure is so narrow that a success often Lakes it as an imaginary line. Maybe, a failure would not see that line.

"Human wants are insatiable" wrote an economist, famous at his work.

Evidently, should a man succeed in satisfying a "want," other "wants" prop up begging to be satisfied. Thus "want" is the basic desire inherent in every human being. Want is different from greed. Want is good provided you have a drive and a desire to satisfy it.

"Wants" with ultimate motive to inhibit other people in their attainment of desirable objectives is really tantamount to moral reprehension. Sad, of course, such moral reprehensibles are the ground works of institutionalized racism and apartheid system. They have done; in great measure, so immeasurable damages wherever those forms of human dispisables are so obtainable.

"Wants" are not just desirable objectives. The ability to foot their bills are more important. A man may be "willing" but the "ability" to do so would be lacking. So, at this stage in question, "capability " arrests the "willingness, " ordering "willingness to place its "worth" where its "mouth" is.

Morally speaking, "greed" is sin. But the greed tamed with pure motive can lead to wealth accumulation.

See Yourself For What You Are: You are a "tiger." Therefore you must have the eyes of a "tiger." Never again under-estimate what a lucky fellow you are-to be 11 enlisted" among the few "wise" ones who are to fight this very battle needed for success.

There are many people out there who would trade all things in their world to be numbered among your current in-group. The scriptures told us, "many are called. But few are chosen." Then, "blessed" are the "few" wise ones who are fortunate enough to be "chosen. "

They are "chosen" not because of their ethnic race, cultural background, family station, intellectual heights or any other greatness cognizable by earthly populace as of paramount value.

They are chosen because they have one essential talent, coupled with an unflinching determination to make their lives worth their variety of individual calling.

It is a recognizable human feature that "the bests do not give up."

Obviously vigilance is the soul of conventional battle. Surprise bombardment often, leads to an impressive glory. That, only by a carefully lightening quick tactical attack.

For the coward of heart, to fight that battle is equal to a reading of a "riot act." Indeed, a fearful pessimist would say, "Oh my God, the lion will devour me. My family will lose everything." But, when a brave optimist confronts this same "predicament." He will prefer to fight. Being a man of inner strength, he fights hard. He will fight with all his might. He will capture all the benefits derivable from the prize war.

A War Of Toughness: Success is a "war" of toughness. The "war" demands toughness in mind, spirit and firmness of purpose when a raging tide storms high, It is a fight to win; not to lose. Of course it is not everyone who would stand this type of battle-There are brave souls and fearful ones out there .

A winner is hardly intimidated by the noise of battle. He sees the link between the noise of battle and the dearer call of duty.He turns a deaf ear to the noise, suppresses his fear, and grabs the linkage to win. As mentioned, a "strong" and "wise" one can win the battle. He is strong because he fights hard. He is wise because he knows how to fight to win. He combines his strength and wisdom to form a "strength of character." In due time, he receives not a surrendering until the enemy surrenders, but a crown of victory because he forced the enemy to surrender.

A man who would not believe in surrendering until the enemy surrenders is a winner. Coming to this brave soul; a man who sees life different, is the thrill of success.

Success Is A Constant Battle: It is a war. War-like quality is an attribute of success. Success, often, demands constant confrontation of 1A maximum danger. This is the kind of "danger" which is nothing but a litmus test that clearly differentiates a winner from a loser. As a loser fails this test, a winner shines brilliantly in his radiant armor of success. His mind becomes more alert-His brave instinct devices and delivers tactical procedure by which its surprising blow render its "battle" capitulated at a flashing strike of the moment. The victim falls. He rejoices.

As a winner would see it; the call of fear, at that point is non-existent. He sees himself as nothing but a winner on the winning side. With speed he rushes to grab his kill.

Truly, most brave hunters do their job through the powers of their instincts.S
