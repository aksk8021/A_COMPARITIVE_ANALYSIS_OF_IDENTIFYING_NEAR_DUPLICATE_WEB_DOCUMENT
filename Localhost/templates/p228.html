The autumn wind rushes in long gusts over the “toten Bühl”, a part of the plateau in the southern Black Forest of Baden; the fir trees sigh in the lower elevations, but up on the bare heights the few old gnarled beeches groan and on the lonely towering crucifix the wooden figure of the Savior trembles after rain and wind have loosened the wooden nails and worn down the attachment. Barren and rough, inhospitable is this strip of Baden Black Forest land, which the locals call the "dead hill", because the row of hills is a true reminder of the death of nature, afflicted by sharp west winds and frequent heavy snowfall, which has already fallen on the old thatched roofs of the Forest villages falls when over there on the glittering Rhine, in the sunny garden of the Baden lowlands, meadows and meadows are still resplendent in their late summer splendour. Individual district names betray only too clearly the self-criticism of the foresters about their closest, rarely deserted homeland; here a meadow is called the "miserable Löchle", there an area interspersed with rocks and overgrown by mountain pines is called the "barren land". And closed, rough like his homeland, the Hauensteiner is also in this old district with his tenacious attachment to the old days, to the legendary old "Handfesten und Privilege" of Count Hans, to them unification and medieval imperial immediacy with their difficult fights against the authorities and new right. "Hotzen" are the names of the inhabitants of the Hauensteiner Waldgrund after their artificially pleated harem pants, which often take up ten to twelve cubits of cloth if they are to be to the taste and custom of the burly Alemannic foresters. The wind roaring over the inhospitable heights tells the foresters something of the golden freedom that reigns on the flashing Swiss mountains; it sings powerfully of independence as it thrives in the original cantons of the neighboring country; But nothing penetrates into the tawny shadows and into the weaving of the forest of a new, different time, and the Hauensteiner remains unaffected by the hustle and bustle of a strange world.

The west wind is blowing harder and harder; The firmament is black-grey overcast, individual flakes are already whirling over the "dead hill" as a harbinger of early winter with its relentlessly strict rule, once it has settled in the desolate stretch of forest, the high heath and in the massive stone fields. The wind is shaking the mighty, moss-covered thatched roofs of the lonely village of Hochschür in the “totes Bühl” with increasing urgency, as if it wants to rip pieces off the roof and take them up into the air, to defy the poor foresters. The bride of the wind rages especially about the tavern standing lonely on the side of the little village, whose yellowed sign hardly shows that the three kings from the Orient were once the patron saints for carousing hotzen. The Hochschürer completely forgot about the tavern kings of the Orient and preferred to name the world-forsaken service area the “dry branch” in honor of the enticed linden tree standing next to it, where a sorrel is administered, which is able to pull even grimly torn shoes together again. The storm-tossed inn is mended wherever you look; patched up the age-old, weather-beaten roof with inserted tufts of straw, patched up the dented window panes with paper gluing; the doors show gaping holes, through which the high wind whistles and the smoke from the hearth happily chases through the hall to behind the threshing floor and through the shaky Scheuerttor out to the "Einfahr". The stormy wind grumbles and shakes the household appliance in the "Schild" in the open space, which is still vaulted by the preceding roof; but it may rattle and crack, groan and rumble here, the noise does not lure the landlord to the "dry branch" or any other inhabitant from the house, and the stray leaves can whirl around the house in the wildest gear, nobody will the houses about Don't bend them with wood or weigh them down with stones to prevent kidnapping. Streitpeterle, the landlord of the “dürren Ast” has more important things on his mind than worrying about such trivial things; He's crouching in his room, brooding over a matter that his son brought to him hot from Waldshut this morning, such a palatable innovation that the foresters have been surprised on a number of occasions lately and made them ponder. With the office and in order to "try out" a matter also with the Court Court of Freiburg, is a trifle for old Peter and because of his lust for litigation, which is gradually sucking up his belongings, the "dürre Ast" landlord has also gotten the vulgar name "Streitpeterle", what makes him dumb and thoughtful this time is the message that the government decreed a fire inspection order and is said to have ordered that the chimneys themselves in the forest villages and isolated courtyards must be examined and swept by appointed chimney sweeps. At first Peterle had stared at his flaxen-haired boy, twenty-year-old Jakoble, with wide-open eyes and open mouth, without being able to utter a word. For him the news was as overwhelming as if Jobbeli had reported that "Salpeterhannes" had come to life again and had called for unity to take up arms against the Austrian government

Sweep the forge in a Black Forest house, in a unification farmstead! And what's more, with Peter Gottstein, who understands protesting and litigating better than all the learned gentlemen from Freiburg to Mannheim! But nothing will come of it! If the old Gaugraf Hans von Hauenstein did not have a chimney sweep, the dispute Peterle can also do without one four centuries later, especially since it must first be tried out whether the Appenzell and Graubünden residents have their chimneys swept or whether such a decree is an age-old government intervention that violates rights be, which 'the latter has nothing to command the Hotzen. So Peterle muses to himself and from time to time pushes his calloused right hand into his bushy gray hair as if he wanted to vent his thoughts at the top of his skull. And at times he growls and bites the stumps of his teeth together. Then he jumps up, strides towards a fir shelf on which there are neatly arranged thick stacks of files and now carries fascicle after fascicle onto the roughly assembled table to look up whether there is anything inside on which one could hang oneself for a vigorous protest . But no matter how much Peter leafs through the writings, going through number after number, there is nothing about chimney sweeping. Court orders, old court decisions from grandfather's time, unpleasant things with their memories of the unfortunate nitrate wars and court files, expensive documents that devoured Peter's most beautiful cows and fields and made him almost poor. And after looking through his registry, Peterle comes to the logical conclusion in his train of thought: "If his well-arranged files contain nothing from a fire inspection and chimney sweep, then such a regulation could not possibly be legal." half-dried ink and scribbles down with the crackling goose quill: "Resolution! There has been nothing in the files since grandfather's time about an obligation to have my chimney swept by someone else's organ, and it was never a custom in Hauenstein's country either. Therefore, sothan innovation is refused approval and every foreign chimney sweep thrown out if he dares to come up. He is also not given food and drink in the inn. Given on Evaristustage Anno 1805. Peter Gottstein.” so there could not possibly be a lawful decree.” And so Peter takes a sheet of foolscap paper, dips the dusty quill in the half-dried ink and scribbles down with the crackling goose quill: “Resolution! There has been nothing in the files since grandfather's time about an obligation to have my chimney swept by someone else's organ, and it was never a custom in Hauenstein's country either. Therefore, sothan innovation is refused approval and every foreign chimney sweep thrown out if he dares to come up. He is also not given food and drink in the inn. Given on Evaristustage Anno 1805. Peter Gottstein.” so there could not possibly be a lawful decree.” And so Peter takes a sheet of foolscap paper, dips the dusty quill in the half-dried ink and scribbles down with the crackling goose quill: “Resolution! There has been nothing in the files since grandfather's time about an obligation to have my chimney swept by someone else's organ, and it was never a custom in Hauenstein's country either. Therefore, sothan innovation is refused approval and every foreign chimney sweep thrown out if he dares to come up. He is also not given food and drink in the inn. Given on Evaristustage Anno 1805. Peter Gottstein.” Dips the dusty quill into the half-dried ink and scribbles down with the crackling goose quill: "Resolution! There has been nothing in the files since grandfather's time about an obligation to have my chimney swept by someone else's organ, and it was never a custom in Hauenstein's country either. Therefore, sothan innovation is refused approval and every foreign chimney sweep thrown out if he dares to come up. He is also not given food and drink in the inn. Given on Evaristustage Anno 1805.

He is also not given food and drink in the inn. Given on Evaristustage Anno 1805. Peter Gottstein.”

With a lot of effort, Peterle put this “decision” on paper and then added it to his files. He gets up, literally relieved, puts the fascicle back on the shelf number by number and says to himself: "And now someone should try it, Peterle will act, God knows!"

At the same moment the door is opened and a dainty girl's head peeks in. It's the innkeeper's Thrinele, who stammers, startled when she sees her father and the files: "But Ätti, is he busy with the old papers again?"

"Never mind that, Thrinele! You don't understand anything either! That's my business, which I'll try out up to the last instance!" Thrinele has stepped completely into the room and strides like a wagtail towards her father, on whose arm she lays her right hand and flatteringly asks him not to let Ätti through new litigation bring yourself and everyone else into complete misery. At the same time, the pretty girl tries to find out by cautious questions what has once again aroused the contentious father's desire to litigate. Peter quickly rumbles out that nothing will come of the official chimney sweep as long as he can move his arms and count on the support of like-minded Bühlers.

Thrinele is not able to grasp immediately what it is all about and asks: "Chant sweeping, what's the point with us? That's not customary in our region!"

"Old Count Hans will turn in his grave if he could hear what innovations there are in the forest! But there will not be such with God! Loyal followers of the holy saltpeter cause still live,[1] for which we live and die!”

"Oh Etti! Let go of such things! She survived and
brought only misfortune to our country!"
"Shut up Maidli! A cause for which so many foresters have died, men as well as wyberfolk, does not survive, it does not die, any more than our old faith! We want to remain free and loyal to the church, everything else is vain and not right for us! And no Frenchman, no Austrian, like no other, will climb into my chimney! As true as the old God lives and my name is Peter Gottstein!”

"But is it also true that real chimney-gucksters should come into the forest?"

"Frili it's true! Jakoeble brought the news from Waldshut and other messages that the youngsters without exception had to become soldiers and the old people had to pay new taxes, Accise! God damn me, nothing will come of this, I say!”

"Ätti, I mean, the chimney luck would still be bearable!"

"No! This will only be the beginning and everything else is still to come!”

"But if the chimney sweep doesn't cost us anything, I mean—"

"Cost nothing haha! They will undress us and abuse us until the last goat is out of the house! Our fronts have experienced that with the forest provost as with 'm Vogt at any time! So I swear: I'd sooner be carried to the Chilchhof before a stranger climbed down my chimney! And the Füsi (shotguns) should crackle like in Hannes times!”

Thrinele is frightened on her father's chest and tries to calm him down by pointing out that a chimney sucker is really not worth bloodshed and other mischief.

The old man is still rumbling: "The Gücksler frili nit!" Then the innkeeper's blond Jakoble screams insanely through the door: "You're coming!"

Peter immediately pushes his damsel away and clamors for Füsi so that he can greet the Gücksler properly with a hail of shot. Thrinele is as if transformed, all gentleness has disappeared, a determined look emerges in her delicate little face and she sharply tells the Ätti to refrain from violence. But the innkeeper is already reaching for the shotgun that is hanging in a corner, always loaded, when Thrinele is confronted with him, tears down the rifle together with the nail, with a trembling hand she shuts back the hammer, turns the barrel to the window and pulls the trigger quickly. Dense gunpowder fills the room, the shards of glass fall with a clatter onto the pavement in front of the house. Puzzled, the old man looks at his daughter, who has suddenly become resolute, and at the fired gun. Without a word, Thrinele puts the gun in the corner and leaves the room. Then Peter follows her, undecided how to fend off the enemy. And there it is already the Gücksler commission: an official in uniform with a long trailing sword and a briefcase, a huge tricorn hat with a plume on his head, and next to him the chimney sweep in black uniform with scraper and the ladder on his right shoulder. The old son Jakoble looks at the strange commission with about the devotion with which a cow looks at the new barn door, while Thrinele curtseys to the strict commissioner and asks what he wants. The father also came closer hesitantly, putting his fists in the sack so as not to show his anger too quickly on the outside.

With a rasping voice, the official announces the new edict regarding the compulsion to sweep the chimney and demands submission and admission for his black companion in the name of the Grand Duke of Baden. Then the plume wearer, turning to the old man, asks what the shot meant. Peter pulls his face into a sneering grimace, but Thrinele quickly replies that the rifle discharged accidentally and that the shot was by no means aimed at the advancing commission.

"So so! Well, it's your luck! In the future, however, shots will not be sprayed in the face of any official unless you want to make the acquaintance of the iron master and the gallows. So open up and let the chimney sweep in to work! With you, Peter Gottstein, the beginning should be in the upper forest!”

Approaching Peter asks, "Why me first?"

"Because you are the most important person at the "toten Bühl"!"

Flattered, Peter stands for a while and scratches behind his ear. What shall he do? The fact that he is respected for his influence on the foresters, and that he is given priority even when it comes to sweeping the chimney, flatters him not a little; but he is accustomed to doing exactly the opposite of what is asked of him, and so he tends to refuse, his passion for protest itches him. It is also safe to assume that the saltpeterers at the dead Bühl throw out the black man everywhere and refuse to sweep the chimney, if Peter will have set the shining example for this. And if the fat Federbuschmann were to be thrown out of every Salpetererhof, that would have to be a delightful sight, but certainly a sign for the Freiburg government, that the old spirit of freedom and independence still reigned supreme on the heights of the Black Forest. However, to push the commission away from the "dry branch" in the usual way seems too harmless to Peter in his leadership dignity, the commission people are not usually allowed to leave the farm of the dispute Peterle, they have to hop, run like mad and a souvenir of the "dry branch" take with them that puts them off coming back.

The officer repeats the request, brandishing the briefcase to emphasize his importance. A sneer flashes across Peter's face, and with a grin he says: "If I don't want to, you won't come into my house! But I want to let you in, so long as you climb up the chimney with your plume!”

The official recoils in shock and stutters: "What? What? are you crazy I — I — have nothing to do upstairs — that’s the chimney sweep’s business!”

Even Thrinele can't help but laugh at the droll appearance of the plumed man and his terror and giggles to herself, while Jobbeli, anticipating a joke, opens the front door wide and invites entry with a clumsy arm movement.

Peter insists that the inspector must wait under the forge for the sweeping order to be carried out, otherwise he won't let the chimneyman in. It is up to the official to get the quarrel around so that it does not meet with resistance from the other forest farmers. Maybe it's just a quirk of the stubborn Hotzen, and Peter is the most stubborn of the foresters. The wind is also raging so fiercely around the hill that staying in the sooty kitchen will be preferable. So the inspector decides to come in, and behind him and the chimneyman the others push into the house. Even behind the door the Federbuschmann begins to cough, the smoke from the smoldering hearth almost takes his breath away. The black thinks the fire must be put out

However, Peter now resolutely demands the immediate start of the chimneyman's "government activity" and threatens the violent removal of the entire commission in the event of refusal. Holding the faceletto to his mouth, the inspector gives the order to sweep the chimney, and the black man obediently climbs his ladder into the forge.

As soon as the chimneyman has disappeared upstairs, Peter quickly grabs a bundle of dry brushwood and throws it onto the smoldering embers, and Jobbeli immediately hurries to imitate his father's example vigorously and quickly. The flames leap up greedily, the brushwood crackles like tinder, in no time the kitchen is filled with smoke and the smoke rises in thick clouds up the chimney. In vain the commissary rumbles against such malicious beginnings and wipes his burning eyes; but the Gottsteins don't give a damn about the clamor and keep throwing new sticks on the crackling embers. Only Thrinele does not cooperate and flees away from smoke and smoke into her room. The bushy one imitates her example, coughing, almost choking, and storms into the open. Immediately afterwards the chimney rattles down the forge, stunned by the smoke and crashing, he drives right into the splashing, sparkling embers of the hearth, at which Peter and Jakoble start a real howl of joy and hold their sides laughing at the spectacle, which they highly amused. As if obsessed, the black man jumps away from the stove, howling in pain, and storms outside, leaving a black trail in the freshly fallen snow. Roaring with delight, Peter and Jakoble rush after him to feast their eyes on the frenzied flight of the cheated commission, until the fat inspector with the wobbling plume and behind him the madly jumping black man disappear behind the houses of Hochschür. Peter and Jakoble howl with joy and hold their sides laughing at the spectacle, which amuses them greatly.

Around the ninth hour of the evening it stopped snowing. The clouds are gone, the sky is clear, strewn with mildly shining stars, and the moon sends its silvery light down on the sugar-coated fir trees and the white shimmering Bühlhöhe of the Black Forest. The cross on the dead hill is doused by the magical light, a long shadow on the snowy ground and ghostly the leafless beeches stretch their branches towards the sky. The desolate landscape shimmers in the glittering decoration of winter snowflake, and against the light on the Bühl the black of the fir forests stands out eerily with their eerie darkness and mysterious rigidity. The wind has died down; it's quiet far away, dead and empty. Only occasionally does the fresh snow slide down from the pine peaks in small balls onto the branches and, freed from the white burden, the branches snap back up to their normal position. This gives a crackling noise in the otherwise church-quiet fir trees, which intensifies into a dull roar when the increased snow load breaks through and hits the forest floor. Snow dust then swells for a moment, shrouding everything; but then the white dust settles, the liberated fir towers black in eerie majesty and nocturnal majesty. covering everything; but then the white dust settles, the liberated fir towers black in eerie majesty and nocturnal majesty. covering everything; but then the white dust settles, the liberated fir towers black in eerie majesty and nocturnal majesty.

From the church tower in Hochschür it strikes ten o'clock in the night in long, drawn-out tones. The windows of the few houses in the small village do gleam in the moonlight, but all the lights have gone out. The villagers have long since gone to rest and are sleeping the sleep of the righteous, with the possible exception of those Hochschürer, who have given the village its bad reputation, about which Scheffel writes: "Someone in the area broke into the cellar at night and got potatoes, or the freshly slaughtered piglet is taken out of the chimney for him, so it is said: it will have gone the way of all flesh to Hochschür.” Really black figures break away from some little houses, tall men wearing dark cloaks, flowing coats and huge ones on their heads wear fur hats. These figures trudge silently towards one goal: up to the cross at the dead Bühl. And from other quarters, too, men make pilgrimages, closely veiled against frost and cold; some through the fir trees from Gebisbach, others from Altenschwand and Hottingen, from Sägeten, the little village about which it is said: Hochschür and Sägeten give a carrier (carrying capacity, ie they weigh the same [in their reputation]), and from Herrischried. Strangely somber, the figures stand out against the glittering snow, almost ghostly in their black coats and high hats. From all sides they climb and climb the dead hill, silent, serious, solemn, and form a circle around the cross, before which they lifted their caps and bowed their knees, at the same time crossing their chests. The human ring on the Bühlhöhe will be double and triple,

And as the clock in Hochschür strikes the witching hour, one of the nightly congregation begins to speak: “In the name of the Holy Virgin Mary. Goodness! (Welcome)."

"Gottwilche!" sounds a muffled voice in the triple
human ring.
It's Streitpeter, who expressed the welcome as the confidant of the Saltpeterer am Toten Bühl, who called the meeting to discuss important things, and who now leaves the ring, stands at the crossbar and begins to speak: "God wilche! 's isch e gheimi thing, the mer han z' negotiate up at the dead hill. Are you all there that I invite to the spiritual hour? The men from Gebisbach, Altenschwand, Hottingen, Sägeten, Hochschür and Herrischried?”

With a muffled voice, the conspirators report from the proclaimed
places.
"Are you still coming from the forest?"

"Yes! I, Ägidius Riedmatter von Kuchelbach am aach chomme!” calls an old man from the third ring.

Deep emotion goes through the rows of people, humming whispers of surprise that a saltpeterer has also arrived from the Albthal, who is the leader over there and the main advocate of the holy cause.

Peter tells Riedmatter to go to the cross and tell the congregation what he has on his mind as a real saltpeterer.

The men step aside a little to let old Riedmatter through, and with firm steps he steps onto the magically illuminated cross, bares his head framed by white hair and speaks in a strong voice: "In the name of the Holy Virgin Mary, greetings, Salpeterer! What I'm about to tell you is short and sweet: You all know who I am! And to me, Ägidius Riedmatter, the spirit of Saltpeterhannes, Albiez's spirit, really and truly appeared in the quiet night, and the same spirit initiated me and designated me as Hannesle's successor in the leadership of the Saltpeterers. I should take up the fight and lead it like Hannes himself once did! And I followed the spirit's admonition and took over my sacred and difficult office over there in the Albthal.

"Yes! We want, in the name of the triune God, for the freedom of our people and for our faith!

Now Peter asks the old Riedmatter: "Did Hannes' ghost really appear to you? Raise your right hand to the cross and swear to us on the Holy Trinity!”

"I swear it!"

"Then we believe you! And you, Aegidi, shall henceforth also be our leader in the holy battle. Do you want?"

"Yes I do! By the hand of the old festivals and privileges, the imperial letters, I want to conduct our cause and not tire in defending our old rights. Swear obedience and allegiance to me!”

"We swear!"

"And now listen: Like Hans Albiez, we too must defend the ancient rights of the County of Hauenstein. Our association, which also includes brave women, sons and daughters, is willing to sacrifice their lives for this. However, open rebellion with guns in hand can only result in the fate of our grandfathers, violent exile, loss of life and property. We still have to give way to superiority now! But what we can and must do is uphold our old rights, which we will never renounce, even if bayonets are set on our chests and dragged to the gallows! No renunciation, but also no violent rebellion. We don't pay homage to anyone, we want to remain free and independent! And big important things are preparing! our worst enemy

Sudden surprise runs through the crowd and loud cries ring out in the night sky.

"Quiet! The monastery will be abolished! I, the successor of Albiez, tell you! And once we have got rid of this enemy, the old freedom beckons again, which over there the free Swiss mountains beckon to us full of promise! No dominion has ever rightly existed over us, not the Prince of St. Blaise, not the French, not the Grand Duke of Baden! The latter is not our sovereign, he is only Meier (administrator), appointed by the Emperor! And Austrian rule was never justified! We also refuse to pay homage to this rulership! Only the Emperor is the protector of us and Switzerland! We must ask him to help us to regain our old rights, so there are: no protection money, freedom from taxes and appraisals, from interest and tithes! We only provide militias voluntarily! The emperors promised us all of this, such as Emperor Josef in 1782 and Emperor Franz in 1802. I have the imperial letters and say, as Hans Fridli Gersbach von Bergalingen said: "Anyone who wants to read these letters can come to me: whoever doesn't want to believe it has his schoolmaster here in my Knorrenstock. I said it, I'm dying for this. At home, remember that there are gloves behind the stove,[2] you understand me!”» We hope in God and the Emperor and wait to see how it turns out! And as for the blood tax, the provision of recruits, which will probably soon be demanded of us, get rid of the young when the time comes. People also live across the border! If you can write, don't sign anything, promise nothing, renounce anything! And do not worship! You will hear more from me! Now, in the name of the Holy Mother of God, separate and keep silent what is hers. Amen!"

Man after man now approaches Riedmatter and wordlessly shakes his hand, thus making a silent pledge of allegiance. And after saluting the cross again, the men silently leave the hill. Riedmatter and Peter stay behind in secret dialogue. Only when the clock in the tower strikes one do they walk down the shimmering white Bühl. Only the represented snow still gives news of the nocturnal gathering. Soon after, however, the moon veils its luminous face, black clouds gather, the westerly wind blows again, and fresh snow covers everything again and erases every trace....

  Winterszit, heavy Zit!
  Snow on all mountains lit….
