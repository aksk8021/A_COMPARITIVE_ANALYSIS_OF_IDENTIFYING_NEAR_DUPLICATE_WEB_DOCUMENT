Fissure.—The domain of surgery includes few diseases which produce such intense suffering to the patient as does the affection under consideration, and none in which proper treatment is followed by more prompt relief and more certain ultimate success.

Fissure, although so simple in extent and character and so readily curable, exercises a most potent influence in undermining the patient's health and strength, the constant pain and irritation to the nervous system being more than the majority of persons can endure.

Definition.—We may define a fissure, or irritable ulcer of the rectum, as a superficial breach of the mucous membrane in the anal region, of a highly sensitive nature, giving rise to spasmodic contraction and paroxysmal pain of a peculiar character. According to Bodenhamer,[1] its shape may be linear, oblong, or circular.

Location.—Its position is usually just within the verge of the anus, beginning at the muco-cutaneous junction or Hilton's line, and extending upward toward the rectum for a distance seldom exceeding half an inch. It may occupy any portion of the circumference of the anal region, but its usual site is at its posterior or coccygeal side.

Multiple Character.—Although this lesion is usually solitary, we sometimes find it multiple, especially when it is of syphilitic origin.

Age and Sex Affected.—Anal fissure is a disease of adult life, and is said to be more common among women than among men. Very young children, however, are not exempt, as many reported cases show. The late Dr. D. Hayes Agnew[2] mentions having seen it occur in infants not over two months old. Dr. A. Jacobi[3] is of the opinion that this affection is a more common one than is generally supposed, and believes that many of the fretful children who sleep badly and cry constantly, and often present symptoms simulating those of vesical calculus, suffer from fissure of the anus. He quotes Kjellberg, who at the Dispensary at Stockholm among 9098 children found 128 cases of fissure of the anus, of which number 60 were boys and 68 were girls; the majority were less than one year old, and in 73 cases the age was less than four months.

Etiology.—The explanation of the very intense pain by which this disease is characterized is to be found upon study of the structural arrangement of the termination of the bowel, with especial attention to the nerve-supply of the part. Therefore it will be in order to review at this point the more important anatomical features of the lower portion of the rectum.

The outlet of the intestine is closed by two sphincter muscles, the external being immediately beneath the skin surrounding the margin of the anus. It is elliptical in form, about half an inch in breadth on each side of the anus, and is attached posteriorly by a small tendon to the tip and back of the coccyx; anteriorly it becomes blended with the transverse and bulbo-cavernosus muscles at the central point of the perineum. The internal sphincter consists of the normal circular fibers of the rectum, considerably increased in number; its thickness is about two lines, and its vertical measurement from half an inch to an inch. It is situated immediately above and partly within the deeper portion of the external sphincter, being separated from it by a layer of fatty connective tissue.

These muscles—the two sphincters—are separated on the outer side by the attachment of the levator ani, some of the fibers of which are internally connected with the external sphincter; on the inner side the muscles are in contact, the line of union corresponding accurately with the junction of the skin and the mucous membrane. In most cases this junction of the sphincters is marked by a line of condensed connective tissue.[4] This line is known as "Hilton's white line."

Hilton has pointed out an important anatomical fact in connection with this line—to wit, that it is the point of exit of the nerves, principally branches of the pudic, which descend between the two sphincter muscles, becoming superficial in this situation, and are there distributed to the papillæ and mucous membrane of the anus (Fig. 1).

These nerves are very numerous, which accounts not only for the extreme sensitiveness of the part, but also, as stated by Andrews,[5] for its very abundant reflex communications with other organs. They play a very important part in the etiology of irritable ulcers. The exposure of one of their filaments, either in the floor or at the edge of the ulcer, is an essential condition of its existence.[6]

The upper portion of the rectum possesses very little sensibility, as the chief nerve-supply of the organ is at its termination and around the anus; hence it is that such grave diseases as cancer or ulceration may exist in the higher parts of the bowel and not manifest their presence by pain.


Fig. 2—Diagram of the Nervous Relations of Irritable Ulcer of the Anus (Hilton). a, ulcer on sphincter ani; b, filaments of two nerves are exposed on the ulcer, the one a nerve of sensation, the other of motion, both attached to the spinal cord, thus constituting an excito-motor apparatus; c, levator ani muscle; d, transversus perinæi muscle.

Andrews[7] directs attention to Hilton's diagram (Fig. 2), as showing that impressions from a fissure are carried to that part of the cord which supplies the pudic nerves and the ilio-lumbar, lumbar, and sciatics, which include the motor supply of the external sphincters as well as of the bladder and the lower extremities.

From these general considerations we can understand why reflex spasm of the sphincter is so constant and important a sign of this malady, and how other and more general reflexes are to be accounted for,—such as symptoms of bladder and urethral diseases, radiating pains, etc.

We also find in the nervous mechanism of the part an explanation of the predisposing causes, important symptoms, and pathology of this peculiar affection.

As to the immediate origin of this lesion, it may be said to arise from a variety of causes, such as atony of the rectum, or other conditions leading to constipated habits. In these cases the bowel becomes impacted with hardened feces, which when discharged overstretch the delicate mucous membrane, and thus, either by irritation or by direct abrasion, the ulcer is formed.[8]

In consequence of spasmodic or organic contraction of the external sphincter ani, fecal matter or some other foreign body lodges in the fossa between the two anal sphincters, and by its long-continued presence in this pent-up situation becomes highly irritating and gives rise to an obstinate fissure.[9]

Anal fissure sometimes results from the excoriations produced by vitiated and acrid discharges, such as occur in dysentery, chronic diarrhœa, cholera, leucorrhœa, etc. Hemorrhoids are frequently a predisposing cause and a complication of this affection.[10] They narrow the outlet of the bowel, and through the successive inflammatory attacks to which they are subject the neighboring tissue loses its elasticity, is rendered brittle, and is easily lacerated.

Polypi are not uncommon causes of this lesion.[11] The polypus is usually situated at the upper or internal end of the fissure, but it may be on the opposite side of the rectum, as in several cases coming under the author's observation.

Allingham[12] states that ulcer of the rectum may result from a congenital narrowness of the anal orifice, being then usually seen in children; or it may be caused by an hypertrophied condition of the sphincters, which has arisen from severe constipation or some rectal affection.

Anal fissure is sometimes produced by a superficial excoriation or ulceration of the outlet of the bowel, analogous to that so frequently observed upon the inside of the lips, the tongue, and other parts of the mouth. Bodenhamer[13] mentions having seen several severe cases of this disease produced by a kind of aphthous ulceration in nursing mothers, and one in a child. They were attended with extreme burning pain and more or less anal spasm. He also states that in these cases the ulcerations of the anus were contemporaneous with similar ulcerations of the mouth; their coexistence and the exact similarity of their appearance left little doubt as to their identity.

Harrison Cripps[14] states that a source from which these ulcers sometimes take their origin is a little marginal abscess which has led to the destruction of the portion of the muco-cutaneous surface lying over it.

The anus is liable to a species of chapping resembling that of the lips in winter, which sometimes results in extremely painful fissures. Such a condition is supposed to be induced by the influence of a dry atmosphere or by some slight disturbance in the general health, rendering the parts friable and liable to crack from the slightest violence.

Fissure is sometimes of syphilitic origin. Finally, it may be due to mechanical injuries, such as uterine displacement, the severe straining efforts made in parturition, the careless use of the enema syringe, the awkward employment of instruments by the surgeon in the diagnosis and treatment of rectal diseases, etc.

Bodendamer (op. cit., p. 58) calls attention to a fact of some importance as bearing upon this point—to wit, that in some cases of constipation, while the diaphragm and other abdominal muscles act with considerable energy, the anal sphincters remain more or less contracted, and yield but slowly, so that the indurated feces contuse and abrade the surface of one or more points of the mucous membrane, which abrasions, if they do not heal, lay the foundation of the disease.

CHAPTER II.
 
SYMPTOMATOLOGY—PHYSICAL EXPLORATION—DIAGNOSIS—PROGNOSIS.
Symptoms.—The symptoms in the early stage of this disease are not usually severe, and are generally experienced during defecation, when at some point or other there will be an uneasy sensation, consisting of an itching, pricking, slight smarting, or a feeling of heat about the circumference of the anus. As the disease progresses, the discomfort attending the movements of the bowel is greatly augmented, and at a variable period of time gives place to a severe pain, of a burning or lancinating character, which is followed by throbbing and excruciating aching, attended by violent spasmodic contraction of the sphincter muscles, continuing from half an hour to several hours.

From reflex irritation, pains are often experienced in other parts, simulating sciatica or rheumatism; the urinary organs, as has already been mentioned, are liable to be sympathetically deranged, causing attention to be diverted from the real seat of the disease.

The ulcer being fully established, the suffering usually comes on with intensity shortly after the actual passage of the motion, and frequently it lasts for many hours, completely incapacitating the patient for work while it continues. I have known persons affected with this malady who for hours were obliged to maintain one position, or to assume the recumbent posture, for fear that the slightest movement would aggravate the pain.

After an indefinite period the pain subsides or entirely disappears, the patient feeling fairly comfortable, or even perfectly well, and to all outward appearance he would continue so were it not for the knowledge that the subsequent passage of fecal matter will bring with it a recurrence of agony. In consequence of this dread, the act of defecation is postponed as long as possible, with the result that when the evacuation does take place the pain is greatly increased.

The feces, when solid, will be passed streaked with purulent matter,—possibly also with blood,—and when more soft will be figured and of small size; sometimes they are flattened and tape-like, due to the incomplete relaxation of the sphincters during defecation. Not infrequently the appearance of such a stool leads the inexperienced to make a diagnosis of stricture of the rectum. In this connection it may be well to state that a fissure is sometimes found associated with a stricture, which latter is due to a congenital contracted state of the anus. Serremone, quoted by Ball,[15] believes that the stricture is the cause and not the result of the fissure, the narrow outlet being more liable to injury from over-stretching.

When a fissure is of long duration, the constitution becomes greatly impaired as a result of the constant pain, the constipation, and the frequent resort to narcotics, and the patient is liable to fall into a state of melancholy and extreme nervous irritability; the countenance, expressive of pain, grows care-worn and sallow; the appetite is poor; and there is more or less emaciation, associated with the general appearance of a person suffering from serious organic disease.

Flatulence is another annoying symptom that generally attends severe cases of anal fissure.[16] It is not only troublesome, but also painful, the disengagement of gas being almost certain to bring on a paroxysm of pain.

Such are the rational symptoms of anal fissure. If, then, a patient comes to a physician, complaining of severe pain lasting for some time after defecation, the presumption is strong that a fissure exists, since no other rectal disease produces this characteristic distress. But in this as in all other affections of the inferior extremity of the intestinal tract we must supplement our investigation by an actual exploration of the parts, in order to determine the true character of the trouble and to exclude the presence of coexisting lesions.

Ocular and Digital Examination.—Previous to making the rectal examination, the bowels should be thoroughly emptied by an enema,—the subsequent pain and anal spasm being prevented by a preliminary local application of a four-per-cent. solution of the hydrochlorate of cocaine to the mucous membrane of the anus, the drug being applied on a pledget of cotton and left in situ for five or ten minutes. Care must be exercised not to use the solution too freely, as otherwise toxic symptoms are apt to ensue when the drug is employed in this region. The rich lymphatic and vascular supply of the part probably accounts for this fact.


Fig. 3—Head Mirror.

The rectum and the bladder being completely evacuated, the patient should be placed on the side in a good light, with the knees drawn up and one hand supporting the uppermost buttock. To condense the light on the parts to be examined the head mirror may be employed (Fig. 3).

Upon inspection, the first thing that attracts our notice, frequently, is a red, somewhat edematous prominence (Fig. 4) close to the verge of the anus, looking not unlike a small hemorrhoid. This excrescence has been termed the "sentinel pile." Upon placing a finger on each side of the tumor and pressing down and out, as recommended by Bodenhamer,[17] the fissure will be seen.


Fig. 4—Anal Fissure associated with the so-called "sentinel pile" (Bodenhamer).

An important point, to which Bodenhamer calls attention, is the external appearance of the anus itself, which in these cases is usually in a highly contracted state and more or less infundibuliform; the observer being struck by the very considerable depth to which the anus is retracted, and its unnatural look.

The fissure is sometimes difficult to find, and must be searched for in the folds of the anus. This can be accomplished by drawing the mucous membrane away on each side, by which means we shall usually be able to see just within the orifice an elongated, club-shaped ulcer, the floor of which may be very red and inflamed, or, if the disease is of long standing, of a grayish color, with the edges well defined and indurated. Sometimes the ulcer is quite superficial, while in other instances it extends completely through the muco-cutaneous surface, exposing the subjacent muscular coat. Cripps[18] states that these ulcers are sometimes undermined, so that a probe may be passed for a short distance beneath them, while occasionally a little fistulous channel will run some distance up the anus.

A fact to which special attention should be directed here is that small ulcerations may exist in the sinuses of Morgagni. Kelsey[19] and Vance[20] have met with such cases, the ulceration being completely hidden from sight, and detectable only by the sharp pain caused by the introduction of a small bent probe. This condition is no doubt a rare one, but is none the less important on this account, for its situation is such that it may be readily overlooked.

The next step in the examination of a case of fissure is the introduction of the finger into the rectum,[21] and it should be conducted in the following manner.[22] If the lesion be situated dorsally, pressure should be made by the finger toward the perineum, thus avoiding the fissure and rendering the introduction of the digit as painless as possible. If the fissure be situated anteriorly or laterally, the finger should be pressed toward the opposite side of the bowel.

In cases of fissure the speculum ani is seldom required by those accustomed to making rectal examinations. In the majority of instances the possession of the tactus eruditus—education of the sense of touch—will enable the surgeon to form a correct diagnosis without the aid of this instrument, and thus save the patient much pain. If a speculum should be required, the instrument of Aloe (Fig. 5) or of Sims (Fig. 6) may be employed.


Fig. 5—Aloe's Speculum.


Fig. 6—Sims' Speculum (detachable handle).

It is not an uncommon occurrence, according to Allingham,[23] to find a polypus associated with fissure, it being situated at the upper end of the ulcer, or lying against it on the opposite side of the wall of the rectum. I have met with several such instances. If the polypus be undiscovered, treatment of the fissure will prove useless, for it will not heal until the polypoid growth is removed. In searching for a polypus, it is important to remember that the investigation should be conducted by passing the finger from above downward, as otherwise the tumor may be pushed up out of reach, the pedicle in these cases often being of considerable length.

Diagnosis.—The manifestations of this disease are so characteristic of the lesion that it seems almost impossible for an error to be made in its diagnosis. The peculiar nature of the pain, the time of its occurrence (either during or some time after an evacuation of the bowels), its continued increase until it becomes almost unbearable, and its gradual decline and entire subsidence until the next evacuation, are symptoms clearly pointing to fissure, and in most instances should be sufficient evidence to establish a diagnosis; yet in a number of well-authenticated cases mistakes have been made, and patients suffering from this disease have been treated for neuralgia, uterine or vesical trouble, stricture, and even hemorrhoids.

Anal fissure is very readily distinguished from neuralgia by the absence in the latter of any breach of surface or of any other disease of the mucous membrane of the rectum; by the entire want of connection between the pain and the alvine evacuations; and by the constant suffering. In neuralgia the pain caused by pressure with the finger in the anus is not confined to one spot, as it is in fissure, but all portions of the bowel are alike tender. It is true that the morbid sensibility of the rectum and anus caused by a fissure and that caused by neuralgia are often so intimately blended that it is sometimes no easy matter to distinguish between them; nothing but the detection itself, in some cases, of the fissure, which can always be discovered by a thorough examination, will clear up the diagnosis.[24]

The symptoms of anal fissure often simulate so closely those of uterine disease and bladder affections that the surgeon is led astray and overlooks the real seat and true nature of the malady. Occasionally the spasmodic condition of the sphincter in these cases simulates the symptoms of stricture; but a thorough examination will dispel all uncertainty by revealing the presence of the ulcer.

Frequently uterine trouble or hemorrhoids are found associated with the fissure, and in this event the case is treated for either one or the other of the first two complaints, the presence of the other lesion being unsuspected and consequently neglected. In all such instances a careful inspection of all the parts concerned will at once remove all errors in diagnosis and dispel all doubts.

In children, the fact must always be borne in mind that fissures and other erosions about the anal orifice may be due to the scratching induced by the irritation of pin-worms.

Course and Prognosis.—Anal fissure is not an immediately dangerous disease; nor can it be said that it has any tendency toward recovery if let alone. An indefinite time may elapse without any other change than the gradual wearing down of the patient's vitality from continued suffering and nervous strain. With proper treatment, however, this disease can be promptly cured, and practically without risk, the operation usually practiced being one of the simplest of surgical procedures.It is highly important to the success of any plan of treatment directed toward the cure of anal fissure, that attention be paid to the condition of the bowels. Regularity of habit should be established, and the evacuations rendered semi-fluid—as figured or hard stools generally aggravate the symptoms.

To accomplish these purposes, enemata or mild aperients should be employed, and the diet must be regulated, the use of bland and unirritating food being enjoined.

All drastic purges should be avoided, as they are more or less irritating to the extremity of the rectum.

In order to establish a daily evacuation of the bowels and to render the movement as painless as possible, I am in the habit of ordering an enema of warm water, or one of rich flaxseed tea, say from half a pint to a pint, to be administered every evening; preference being given to the night-time, as then the patient can assume the recumbent posture, which, combined with the rest, affords the most relief from subsequent pain.

If the first enema should prove ineffective, it should be repeated in half an hour. In order to relieve the pain and spasm of the sphincters attending the evacuation, it is well to use a suppository about half an hour before the enema is employed, consisting of:

℞	Ext. belladonnæ	gr. 1/8 ad 1/2.
Cocain. hydrochloratis	gr. 1/4 ad 1/2.
Ol. theobromæ	gr. x.
Misce,	et fiat suppositoria j.	
Or an ointment of extract of conium may be used, as recommended by Harrison Cripps:[25]

℞	Ext. conii	ℨ ij.
Olei ricini	ℨ iij.
Ung. lanolini            ad	℥ ij.
A small quantity of this ointment should be smeared on the part five minutes before expecting a motion, and again after the motion has passed.

All ointments used in the treatment of rectal disease may be applied by means of a hard-rubber pipe (Fig. 7).


Fig. 7—Hard-rubber Ointment-Applicator.

The various methods of treating anal fissure may be divided, for the sake of convenience, into the palliative and the operative.

Palliative Measures.—Palliative treatment will meet with success in a considerable proportion of cases, especially when there is no great hypertrophy of the sphincter muscles. Allingham[26] states that the curability of this lesion does not depend upon the length of time during which it has existed, but rather upon the pathological changes it has wrought. He asserts that he has cured fissures of months' standing by means of local applications, where the ulcers were uncomplicated with polypi or hemorrhoids, and where there was not very marked spasm or thickening of the sphincters.

It is essential to the success of the treatment of fissure, especially by local applications, that rigid cleanliness of the parts be maintained; for this purpose the anus and the adjacent portions of the body should be carefully sponged night and morning and after each stool with hot or cold water, the temperature being regulated to suit the patient's comfort.

An excellent instrument for irrigating the rectum is the one devised by Dr. Edward Martin, of Philadelphia (Fig. 8). I have also employed Bodenhamer's instrument for this purpose (Fig. 9).

In applying the various local remedies it is necessary first to expose the ulcer to view, and to anæsthetize its surface with a four-per-cent. solution of hydrochlorate of cocaine, well brushed in with a camel's-hair pencil. The application of the cocaine may have to be repeated once or twice, at intervals of three or four minutes, in order to obtain the desired anæsthetic effect.


Fig. 8—Martin's Rectal Irrigator.


Fig. 9—Bodenhamer's Irrigator.

If any ointment has been used about the fissure, the anus should be subjected to a hot-water douche before using the cocaine, as cocaine will not exert its anæsthetic influence on a greasy surface.[27] For this purpose Martin's irrigator (Fig. 8) answers admirably. The parts should subsequently be dried thoroughly with cotton or a sponge. A convenient sponge or cotton mop holder is shown in Fig. 10.


Fig. 10—Rectal Sponge-Mop Holder.

Among the different remedies that have been used for the local treatment of fissure of the anus may be mentioned the following: Nitrate of silver; acid nitrate of mercury; fuming nitric acid; carbolic acid; sulphate of copper; the actual cautery, etc.

Of these topical applications, the nitrate of silver is the best. Its effects are various: it lessens or entirely calms the nervous irritation which is so important a factor in producing spasmodic contraction of the sphincters; it shields the raw and exposed mucous surface, by forming an insoluble albuminate of silver; it destroys the hard and callous edges of the ulcer, and tends to remove the diseased and morbid action of the parts.

The form in which I usually employ this salt is in solution (from ten to thirty grains to the ounce). To attain the best results, the solution should be used once in twenty-four or forty-eight hours, according to circumstances. It may be applied by means of cotton attached to a silver applicator or cotton-holder (Fig. 11), or to a piece of wood. The application is made by separating the margins of the anal orifice with the thumb and index finger of the left hand, and introducing into the anus the probe charged with the solution.


Fig. 11—Cotton-Applicator.

According to Bodenhamer,[28] if the ulcer is more than one-third of an inch above the margin of the anus it will be necessary to use the speculum.

The solution is to be applied to the fissure only; a few drops are all that will be required. If thorough local anæsthesia has been induced by the use of cocaine, the application of the silver salt produces little if any suffering; for by the time the anæsthetic has lost its effect the acute pain caused by the nitrate of silver will have passed away.

After each application the part should be well smeared with an ointment of iodoform (thirty grains to the ounce). The odor of the iodoform may be disguised by the addition of a few drops of otto of roses. Iodol may be used instead of iodoform, and in the same way.

After the ulcer has been touched once or twice with the silver solution, the effect will be, in those cases which are benefited by this treatment, a considerable mitigation of the severe pain which has troubled the patient when at the closet and afterwards; and the sore will present a healthy granulating appearance, and slowly contract in size.

In children and in young persons, unless the fissure be complicated with some other affection, this lesion is almost always curable by adopting the foregoing mode of treatment.

Some authorities speak highly of the use of the acid nitrate of mercury, fuming nitric acid, carbolic acid, the actual cautery, etc., but in my experience their employment is attended with more suffering than follows the employment of the nitrate of silver or the simple operative treatment which will presently be described. Furthermore, the application of these remedies is not so certain to effect a cure as either of the two procedures just mentioned, so that I rarely resort to their use.

The daily introduction of a full-sized bougie, made of wax or tallow, will sometimes act beneficially in cases of fissure, by distending the sphincter and producing such an amount of irritation as will set up a healing process in the ulcer. An application of cocaine or of belladonna ointment should be made to the part prior to the employment of the bougie.

Allingham[29] strongly advocates the local use of the following ointment:

℞	Hydrarg. subchlor	gr. iv.
Pulv. opii	gr. ij.
Ext. belladonnæ	gr. ij.
Ung. sambuci	ℨ j.
M.	Sig.: To be applied frequently.	
This authority states that he has cured many cases with this ointment alone.

Another excellent ointment recommended by Mr. Allingham[30] is the following:

℞	Plumbi acetatis } __	
Zinci oxidi     } aa	gr. x.
Pulv. calaminæ	gr. xx.
Adipis benzoatis	℥ ss.
M.		
An ointment of red oxide of mercury, thirty grains to the ounce, has also cured many cases.

The "Brinkerhoff System," as applied to fissures of the anus, is thus described by Dr. Edmund Andrews:[31]

"Once or twice a month, as the itinerant doctor comes around on his circuit, he inserts his little speculum, cleans out the ulcer, and applies to it a solution of nitrate of silver, forty grains to the ounce. Between the applications the patient uses a morning and evening treatment himself. Each morning he is to evacuate the bowels, then inject the rectum with lukewarm water, and finally insert into it a little ointment, consisting of three grains of carbolic acid and eight grains of sulphur to the ounce of vaseline or lard.

"For evening treatment he uses 'Brinkerhoff's Ulcer Remedy,' having the following composition:

℞	Extract of hamamelis dist	f ℨ v.
Solution of persulph. of iron	f ℨ j.
Cryst. carbolic acid	gr. ij.
Glycerine	f ℨ ij.
M.  Sig.: Add half a teaspoonful of this to the same quantity of starch, and about an ounce and a half of water. Inject into the rectum every evening."

Operative Treatment.—In the more severe cases local treatment will fail to effect a cure, and operative interference will be necessary. There are three methods of repute to be considered in this connection: (1) forcible dilatation; (2) incision; (3) a combination of these two procedures, dilatation and incision.

Forcible Dilatation.—This is the operation recommended by Récamier, Van Buren, and others. It consists in introducing the two thumbs into the bowel, back to back, and then forcibly separating them from each other until the sides of the bowel can be stretched as far out as the tuberosities of the ischia. It is essential to place the ball of one thumb over the fissure, and that of the other directly opposite to it, in order to prevent the fissure from being torn through and the mucous membrane being stripped off. As pointed out by Allingham,[32] it is well to repeat the stretching in other directions until the entire circumference of the anus has been gone over. In this manner, by careful and thorough kneading and pulling of the muscles, the sphincters will be made to give way, and will be rendered soft and pliable. This procedure should always be done with the patient thoroughly under the influence of an anæsthetic, and should occupy at least five or six minutes.

This operation is perfectly safe, but, as it is no less severe than the operation by incision, and as in some cases it fails to effect a cure, I can see no advantage in adopting it instead of the more satisfactory and always successful plan of treatment by combined dilatation and incision. It may be found preferable in some cases on account of the prejudice of patients against the use of the knife.

Incision.—A fissure can be cured by this method, by making an incision through the base of the ulcer and a little longer than the fissure itself, so as to make sure of severing all the exposed nerve-filaments. The cut should divide the muscular fibers along the floor of the ulcer.

In a fair proportion of cases this operation will meet with success, but it is not so certain and radical as the operation next to be described.

It has the advantage over the other operations, however, of being nearly or entirely painless under local anæsthesia produced by cocaine, and therefore, when general anæsthesia is contra-indicated, or is refused by the patient, this method is worthy of a trial.

Dilatation and Incision.—This operation, if skillfully and carefully performed, I believe to be a radical and unfailing cure for the disease. The bowels should be cleared out by a dose of castor-oil and an injection; after which, under ether-anæsthesia, the sphincters should be dilated in the manner previously described. This being accomplished, and the ulcer properly exposed, a straight blunt-pointed bistoury (Fig. 12) should be drawn deeply across the surface, making a cut about an inch in length and a third of an inch in depth. Instead of the blunt bistoury, a sharp-pointed scalpel may be used (Fig. 13). It should be entered at the margin of the anus, passed under the ulcer, and made to protrude above the ulcer, the overlying structure being then divided from without inward.


Fig. 12—Blunt-pointed Bistoury.


Fig. 13—Sharp-pointed Scalpels.

The subsequent treatment consists in keeping the patient in the recumbent position, and in the use of a little opium to confine the bowels. After three or four days a laxative may be given, from which time daily alvine movements should be secured. In seven or eight days the patient can begin to move about; but for at least two weeks he should avoid standing long on the feet. No dressing is required further than bathing the parts with a little warm water and carbolic acid soap, to remove any offensive discharges. For the same purpose, peroxide of hydrogen may be employed.

The subcutaneous division of the sphincters, as recommended by some authors for the cure of fissure, is not a satisfactory method, and is mentioned here solely to condemn it.
