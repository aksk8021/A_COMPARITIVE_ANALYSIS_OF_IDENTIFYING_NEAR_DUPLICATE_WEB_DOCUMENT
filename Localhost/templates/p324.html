John De Gallatin, who, at the outbreak of the French revolution, was second in command of the regiment of Châteauvieux in the service of Louis XVI., and a devoted believer in the antiquity of his family, maintained that the Gallatins were descended from A. Atilius Callatinus , consul in the years of Rome 494 and 498; in support of this article of faith he fought a duel with the Baron de Pappenheim, on horseback, with sabres, and, as a consequence, ever afterwards carried a sabre-cut across his face. His theory, even if held to be unshaken by the event of this wager of battle, is unlikely ever to become one of the demonstrable facts of genealogy, since a not unimportant gap of about fifteen hundred years elapsed between the last consulship of the Roman Gallatin and the earliest trace of the modern family, found in a receipt signed by the Abbess of Bellacomba for “quindecim libras Viennenses” bequeathed to her convent by “Dominus Fulcherius Gallatini, Miles,” in the year 1258. Faulcher Gallatini left no other trace of his existence; but some sixty years later, in 1319, a certain Guillaume Gallatini, Chevalier, with his son Humbert Gallatini, Damoiseau, figured dimly in legal documents, and Humbert's grandson, Henri Gallatini, Seigneur de Granges, married Agnes de Lenthenay, whose will, dated 1397, creating her son Jean Gallatini her heir, fixes the local origin of the future Genevan family. Granges was an estate in Bugey, in the province of which Bellay was the capital, then a part of Savoy, but long since absorbed in France, and now Faulcher Gallatini left no other trace of his existence; but some sixty years later, in 1319, a certain Guillaume Gallatini, Chevalier, with his son Humbert Gallatini, Damoiseau, figured dimly in legal documents, and Humbert's grandson, Henri Gallatini, Seigneur de Granges, married Agnes de Lenthenay, whose will, dated 1397, creating her son Jean Gallatini her heir, fixes the local origin of the future Genevan family.

Granges was an estate in Bugey, in the province of which Bellay was the capital, then a part of Savoy, but long since absorbed in France, and now{2} embraced in the Department of Ain. It lay near the Rhone, some thirty or forty miles below Geneva, and about the same distance above Lyons. This Jean Gallatini, Seigneur de Granges and of many other manors, was an equerry of the Duke of Savoy, and a man of importance in his neighborhood. He too had a son Jean, who was also an equerry of the Duke of Savoy, and a man of gravity, conscientious in his opinions and serious in his acts. Not only Duke Philibert but even Pope Leo X. held him in esteem; the Duke made him his secretary with the title of Vice Comes, and the Pope clothed him with the dignity of Apostolic Judge, with the power to create one hundred and fifty notaries and public judges, and with the further somewhat invidious privilege of legitimizing an equal number of bastards. Notwithstanding this mark of apostolic favor conferred on the “venerabilis vir dominus Johannes Gallatinus, civis Gebennensis” by a formal act dated at Salerno in 1522, Jean Gallatin was not an obedient son of the Church. For reasons no longer to be ascertained, he had in 1510 quit his seigniories and his services in Savoy and caused himself to be enrolled as a citizen of Geneva. The significance of this act rests in the fact that the moment he chose for the change was that which immediately preceded the great revolution in Genevan history when the city tore itself away not only from Savoy but from the Church. Jean Gallatin was a man of too much consequence not to be welcomed at Geneva. He linked his fortunes with hers, became a member of the Council, and joined in the decree which, in 1535, deposed the Prince Bishop and abrogated the power of the Pope. He died in 1536, the year Calvin came to Geneva, and the Gallatins were so far among the close allies of the great reformer that a considerable number of his letters to them were still preserved by the family until stolen or destroyed by some of the wilder reformers who accompanied the revolutionary armies of France in 1794.[1]

After the elevation of Geneva to the rank of a sovereign republic in 1535, the history of the Gallatins is the history of the city. The family, if not the first in the state, was second{3}to none. Government was aristocratic in this small republic, and of the eleven families into whose hands it fell at the time of the Reformation, the Gallatins furnished trustees and counsellors, with that regularity and frequency which characterized the mode of selection, in a more liberal measure than any of the other ten. Five Gallatins held the position of first syndic, and as such were the chief magistrates of the republic. Many were in the Church; some were professors and rectors of the University. They counted at least one political martyr among their number—a Gallatin who, charged with the crime of being head of a party which aimed at popular reforms in the constitution, was seized and imprisoned in 1698, and died in 1719, after twenty- one year of close confinement. They overflowed into foreign countries. Pierre, the elder son of Jean, was the source of four distinct branches of the family, which spread and multiplied in every direction, although of them all no male representative now exists except among the descendants of Albert Gallatin. One was in the last century a celebrated physician in Paris, chief of the hospital established by Mme. Necker; another was Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Duke of Brunswick, who, when mortally wounded at the battle of Jena, in 1806, commended his minister to the King of Württemberg as his best and dearest friend. The King respected this dying injunction, and Count Gallatin, in 1819, was, as will be seen, the Würtemberg minister at Paris.

That the Gallatins did not restrict their activity to civil life is a matter of course. There were few great battle-fields in Europe where some of them had not fought, and not very many where some of them had not fallen. Voltaire testifies to this fact in the following letter to Count d'Argental, which contains a half-serious, half-satirical account of their military career:

VOLTAIRE TO THE COUNT OF ARGENTAL.
February 9, 1761.
Here is the most beautiful opportunity, my dear angel, to exercise your celestial ministry. This is the best service I can receive from your kindness.{4}

I conjure you, my dear and respectable friend, to employ all your credit with M. le Duc de Choiseul; with his friends; if necessary, with his mistress, &c., &c. And why do I dare to ask you for so much support, so much zeal, so much vivacity, and above all prompt success? For the sake of service, my dear angel; to beat the Duke of Brunsvick. M. Galatin, an officer in the Swiss Guards, who will present my very humble request to you, is of the oldest family in Geneva; they have been killed for us from father to son since Henri Quatre. The latter's uncle was killed before Ostend; his brother was killed on the unfortunate and abominable day at Rosbach, as I believe; a day when the Swiss regiments did their duty alone. If it is not in Rosbach, it is elsewhere; the fact is that he was killed; this one was injured. He has served for ten years; he was aide-major; he wants to be. We need aides-major who speak good German, who are active, intelligent; he is all that. Finally you will know from him precisely what he needs; it is generally permission to go quickly and seek death in your service. Do him this grace, and may he not be killed, for he is very amiable and he is a nephew of that Mme. Calendrin whom you saw when you were a child. Mrs. his mother is just as amiable as Mrs. Calendrin. for he is very amiable and he is the nephew of that Mme. Calendrin whom you saw when you were a child. Mrs. his mother is just as amiable as Mrs. Calendrin. for he is very amiable and he is the nephew of that Mme. Calendrin whom you saw when you were a child. Mrs. his mother is just as amiable as Mrs. Calendrin.

 

One Gallatin fell in 1602 at the Escalade, famous in Genevan history; another at the siege of Ostend, in 1745; another at the battle of Marburg, in 1760; another, the ninth of his name who had served in the Swiss regiment of Aubonne, fell in 1788, acting as a volunteer at the siege of Octzakow; still another, in 1797, at the passage of the Rhine. One commanded a battalion under Rochambeau at the siege of Yorktown. But while these scattered members of the family were serving with credit and success half the princes of Christendom, the main stock was always Genevan to the core and pre-eminently distinguished in civil life.

In any other European country a family like this would have had a feudal organization, a recognized head, great entailed estates, and all the titles of duke, marquis, count, and peer which royal favor could confer or political and social influence could command. Geneva stood by herself. Aristocratic as her{5}government was, it was still republican, and the parade of rank or wealth was not one of its chief characteristics. All the honors and dignities which the republic could give were bestowed on the Gallatin family with a prodigal hand; but its members had no hereditary title other than the quaint prefix of Noble, and the right to the further prefix of de, which they rarely used; they had no great family estate passing by the law of primogeniture, no family organization centering in and dependent on a recognized chief. Integrity, energy, courage, and intelligence were for the most part the only family estates of this aristocracy, and these were wealth enough to make of the little city of Geneva the most intelligent and perhaps the purest society in Europe. The austere morality and the masculine logic of Calvin were here at home, and there was neither a great court near by, nor great sources of wealth, to counteract or corrupt the tendencies of Calvin's teachings. In the middle of the eighteenth century, when Gallatins swarmed in every position of dignity or usefulness in their native state and in every service abroad, it does not appear that any one of them ever attained very great wealth, or asserted a claim of superior dignity over his cousins ​​of the name. Yet the name, although the strongest, was not their only common tie. To certain François Gallatin, who died in 1699, left by will a portion of his estate in trust, its income to be expended for the aid or relief of members of the family. This trust, known as the Bourse Gallatin, honestly and efficiently administered, proved itself to be all that its founder could ever have desired.

One of the four branches of this extensive family was represented in the middle of the eighteenth century by Abraham Gallatin, who lived on his estate at Pregny, one of the most beautiful spots on the west shore of the lake, near Geneva, and who is therefore known as Abraham Gallatin of Pregny. His wife, whom he had married in 1732, was Susanne Vaudenet, commonly addressed as Mme. Gallatin-Vaudenet. They were, if not positively wealthy, at least sufficiently so to maintain their position among the best of Geneva society, and Mme. Gallatin appears to have been a woman of more than ordinary character, intelligence, and ambition. The world knows almost every detail about the society of Geneva at that time; for, apart from{6}a very distinguished circle of native Genevans, it was the society in which Voltaire lived, and to which the attention of much that was most cultivated in Europe was for that reason, if for no other, directed. Voltaire was a near neighbor of the Gallatins at Pregny. Notes and messages were constantly passing between the two houses. Dozens of these little tickets in Voltaire's hand are still preserved. Some are written on the back of ordinary playing cards. The deuce of clubs says:

“We are at the orders of Mrs. Galatin. We will try to employ tinsmith. Parliament Paris refuses any edict and wants the king to ask Parliament Bezançon for forgiveness. English wanted to rebomb Hâvre. Did not succeed. Carriage at half past one. Respects."

There is no date; but this is not necessary, for the contents seem to fix the date for the year 1756. A note endorsed “Des Délices” is in the same tone:

“When V. shows up at his neighbour's, he has no other business, no other goal, than to court her. We are waiting to do rehearsals for the return of the Tyrant who has a chest ache. If there is any news from Berlin, Mr. Gallatin is begged to report it. A thousand respects.”

Another, of the year 1759, is on business:“How is our patient, our dear neighbour, our dear daughter? I have been to the vineyards, madam. Wasps eat everything, and what they don't eat is dry. Madame du Tremblay's winemaker came to give me his presentations. My barrels are not connected, he said; postpone harvest. Connect your barrels, I said. Your grapes are not ripe, he said. Go see them, I said. He has been there; he saw. Harvest as soon as possible, he said. What do you order, Madam, to neighbor V.?”

Another of the same year introduces Mme. Gallatin's figs, of which she seems to have been proud:

“Your figs, madam, are a present all the more beautiful that we can say like the other: because it was not the time of figs . We have none at Les Délices, but we will have a theater at Tourney. And we're leaving in an hour to come see you. Receive you and all your family, madam, the tender respects of V.{7}”

“You give me more figs, madam, than there are in the country of Papimania; and I, Madame, am like the fig tree of the Gospel, dry and accursed. It is not as an actor, it is as being very attached to your whole family that I take a keen interest in the health of Mme. Galatin-Rolaz. We rehearse on Tuesday in pontifical robes. Those who have tickets will come if they want. I am yours, lady, for my life. V.”

Then follows a brief note dated “Ferney, 18 e 7re,” 1761:

“We were all planning to come back to Ferney for dinner after the comedy. The Duc de Villars detained us; our carriage broke; we suffered all possible setbacks; life is strewn with them; but the greatest of all is not having had the honor of supping with you.”

One of the friends for whom Mme. Gallatin-Vaudenet seems to have felt the strongest attachment, and with whom she corresponded, was the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, a personage not favorably known in American history. The Landgrave, in 1776, sent Mme. Gallatin his portrait, and Mme. Gallatin persuaded Voltaire to write for her a copy of verses addressed to the Landgrave, in recognition of this honor. Here they are from the original draft:

“I fucked this charming portrait,
I savored it to you without mystery.
My daughters do the same,
But it's a secret that must be kept quiet.
You will find it good that a mother
Speaks to you a little more boldly;
And you will see that also
You always know how to please.”[2]
The success of Mme. Gallatin in the matter of figs led Voltaire to beg of her some trees; but his fortune was not so good as hers.

“10th August, 1768, in Ferney. You are blessed of God, lady. I have been planting fig trees for six years, and not one has succeeded. This would be the case for drying my fig trees. But if I had miracles to do, it wouldn't be this one. I{8}thank you, madam. I believe that only the old fig trees give. Old age is still good for something. Like you, I have thirty-year-old horses; that's what makes me love them; there is nothing like old friends. Young people, however, are not to be despised, ladies. V.”

One more letter by Voltaire is all that can find room here. The Landgrave seems to have sent by Mme. Gallatin some asparagus seed to Voltaire, which he acknowledged in these words:

VOLTAIRE TO THE LANDGRAVE OF HESSE.
September 15th, 1772, from Ferney .
My lord,-Mrs. Gallatin showed me the letter in which your Serene Highness shows all your wisdom, kindness and taste in speaking of a young man whose reason is a little bewildered. I see that in this letter she grants me a very signal benefit, which one should rarely expect from princes and even from doctors. She gives me a certificate of three years of life, because it takes three years to bring in these beautiful asparagus with which you gratify me. Accept, monseigneur, my very humble thanks. I dare to hope to renew them to you in three years; for after all I must feed on hope before I feed on your asparagus. Why can't I be in a state to come and ask your permission to eat those from your gardens! The beautiful revolution in Sweden carried out with so much firmness and prudence by the king, your relative, makes you want to live. This prince is like you, he makes himself loved by his subjects. It is certainly of all ambitions the finest. All the rest has something chimerical and often very fatal in it. I wish Your Serene Highness many years to come. It's the only wish I can make; you have everything else. I am, with the deepest respect, Monseigneur, of Your Serene Highness the most humble and most obedient servant,

“The old patient of Ferney,
“ Voltaire ”.
The correspondence of his Most Serene Highness, who made himself thus loved by his subjects, cannot be said to sparkle like{9}that of Voltaire; yet, although the Landgrave's French was little better than his principles, one of his letters to Mme. Gallatin may find a place here. The single line in regard to his troops returning from America gives it a certain degree of point which only Americans or Hessians are likely to appreciate at its full value.

THE LANDGRAVE OF HESSE TO M E . GALLATIN-VAUDENET.
Madam !—I accuse you with infinite pleasure of the letter which you were good enough to write to me last March 27, and I offer you my perfect thanks for the part you continue to take in my health, of which I am, one can't anymore, happy. Yours interests me too much not to wish that it also be such as you desire. May the beautiful season which has just finally succeeded the harsh weather it has had, strengthen it for many years to come, and may you enjoy all the contentment that my earnest wishes intend for you.

Although the letter with which you entrusted Mr. Cramer has been returned to me, I am very sorry to have been deprived of the pleasure of making his personal acquaintance, since he did not stop at Cassel, and did not just passed. The favorable testimony that you give him can only prevent in his favor.

Besides, I'm about to undertake a little trip that I've been thinking about for a long time to get a change of scenery. I would already be on my way, if not for my troops returning from America, which I am glad to see again before my departure, and the last regiments of which will be returned to Cassel towards the end of the month.Continue me while waiting for your dear memory, and, while paying my compliments to Mr. and Miss. Gallatin, persuade yourself that nothing is above the true and invariable sentiments with which I will never cease to be, madam, your very humble and very obedient servant.

Frederick L. of Hesse.
Kassel , May 25, 1784.
 

1761-1775.
Mrs. Gallatin-Vaudenet had three children—one son and two daughters. The son, who was named Jean Gallatin, was born in 1733, and in 1755 married Sophie Albertine Rolaz du Rosey of Rolle,—the Mme. Gallatin-Rolaz already mentioned in one of{10}Voltaire’s notes. They had two children,—a boy, born on the 29th of January, 1761, in the city of Geneva, and baptized on the following 7th of February by the name of Abraham Alfonse Albert Gallatin; and a girl about five years older.

Abraham Gallatin, the grandfather, was a merchant in partnership with his son Jean. Jean died, however, in the summer of 1765, and his wife, Mme. Gallatin-Rolaz, who had talent and great energy, undertook to carry on his share of the business in her own separate name. She died in March, 1770. The daughter had been sent to Montpellier for her health, which she never recovered, and died a few years after, in 1777. The boy, Albert, was left an orphan when nine years old, with a large circle of blood-relations; the nearest of whom were his grandfather Abraham and his grandmother the friend of Voltaire and of Frederic of Hesse. The child would naturally have been taken to Pregny and brought up by his grandparents, but a different arrangement had been made during the lifetime of his mother, and was continued after his death. Mrs. Gallatin-Rolaz had a most intimate friend, a distant relation of her husband, Catherine Pictet by name, unmarried, and at this time about forty years old. When Jean Gallatin died, in 1765, Mlle. Pictet, seeing the widow overwhelmed with the care of her invalid daughter and with the charge of her husband's business, insisted on taking the boy Albert under her own care, and accordingly, on the 8th of January, 1766, Albert, then five years old, went to live with her, and from that time became in a manner her child.

1779.
Besides his grandfather Abraham Gallatin at Pregny, and his other paternal relations, Albert had a large family connection on the mother's side, and more especially an uncle, Alphonse Rolaz of Rolle, kind-hearted, generous, and popular. Both on the father's and the mother's side Albert had a right to expect a sufficient fortune. His interests during his minority were well cared for, and nothing can show better the characteristic economy and carefulness of Genevan society than the mode of the boy's education. For seven years, till January, 1773, he lived with Mlle. Pictet, and his expenses did not exceed eighty dollars a year. Then he went to boarding-school, and in August, 1775,{11} to the college or academy, where he graduated in May, 1779. During all this period his expenses slightly exceeded two hundred dollars a year. The Gallatin Scholarship advanced a comparatively large sum for his education and for the expenses of his sister's illness. “No necessary expense was spared for my education,” is his memorandum on the back of some old accounts of his guardian; “but such was the frugality observed in other respects, and the good care taken of my property, that in 1786, when I came of age, all the debts had been paid excepting two thousand four hundred francs lent by an unknown person through Mr. Cramer, who died in 1778, and with him the secret name of that friend, who never made himself known or could be guessed.” In such an atmosphere one might suppose that economists and financiers must grow without the need of education.

Of the nature of Albert's training the best idea can be got from his own account of the Academy of Geneva, contained in a letter written in 1847 and published among his works.[3]At that time the academy represented all there was of education in the little republic, and its influence was felt in every thought and act of the citizens. “In its organization and general outlines the academy had not, when I left Geneva in 1780, been materially altered from the original institutions of its founder. Whatever may have been his defects and erroneous views, Calvin had at all events the learning of his age, and, however objectionable some of his religious doctrines, he was a sincere and zealous friend of knowledge and of its wide diffusion among the people. Of this he laid the foundation by making the whole education altogether almost gratuitous, from the ABC to the time when the student had completed his theological or legal studies. But there was nothing remarkable or new in the organization or forms of the schools.{12}were then, and generally continue to be in the old seminaries of learning.... In the first place, besides the academy proper, there was a preparatory department intimately connected with it and under its control. This in Geneva was called 'the College,' and consisted of nine classes, ... the three lower of which, for reading, writing, and spelling, were not sufficient for the wants of the people, and had several branchesor substitutes in various parts of the city. But for that which was taught in the six upper classes (or in the academy), there were no other public schools but the college and the academy. In these six classes nothing whatever was taught but Latin and Greek—Latin thoroughly, Greek much neglected. Professor de Saussure used his best endeavors about 1776, when rector of the academy, to improve the system of education in the college by adding some elementary instruction in history, geography, and natural science, but could not succeed, a great majority of his colleagues against him....
