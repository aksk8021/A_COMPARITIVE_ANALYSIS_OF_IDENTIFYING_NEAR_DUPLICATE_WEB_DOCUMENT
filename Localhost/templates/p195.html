I
When I was a candidate for the Normal School (it was in October of the year of grace 1848), I made friends with two of my competitors, the Debay brothers. They were Bretons, born in Auray, and brought up at the college of Vannes. Although they were the same age, within minutes, they looked nothing alike, and I've never seen two twins so mismatched. Matthieu Debay was a little man of twenty-three, rather ugly and stunted. His arms were too long, his shoulders too high and his legs too short: you would have said a hunchback who lost his hump. Her brother Léonce was a type of aristocratic beauty: tall, well shaped, with a slender waist, a Greek profile, a[Page 4] proud, the mustache superb. His hair, almost blue, shivered on his head like a lion's mane. Poor Matthew wasn't red, but he had a narrow escape: his beard and his hair offered a sample of all the colors. What pleased him was a pair of small gray eyes, full of finesse, naivety, gentleness, and all the best in the world. Beauty, banished from her whole person, had taken refuge in that corner. When the two brothers came to the exams, Leonce whistled a little cane with a silver head, which aroused many jealousies; Matthieu philosophically dragged a big red umbrella under his arm, which won him the goodwill of the examiners. However he was refused like his brother: the college of Vannes had not taught them enough Greek. We missed Matthieu at school: he had the vocation, the desire to learn, the rage to teach; he was born a teacher. As for Léonce, we unanimously thought that it would be a great pity if such a well-built boy shut himself up like us in the university cloister. Her taking of the dress would have saddened us like the taking of the habit.

The two brothers were not without resources. We even found that they were rich, when we compared their fortune to ours: they[Page 5] had Uncle Yvon. Uncle Yvon, a former cabotage captain, then shipowner for sardine fishing, owned several boats, lots of nets, a few goods in the sun and a pretty house in the port of Auray, in front of the Lower Pavilion . As he had never found the time to marry, he had remained a bachelor. He was a man with a big heart, excellent for poor people and especially for his family, who needed it badly. The people of Auray held him in high esteem; he was from the municipal council, and the little boys said to him as they took off their caps: “Hello, Captain Yvon!” This worthy man had taken Monsieur and Madame Debay into his house, and he was saving two hundred francs a month for the children.

Thanks to this munificence, Léonce and Matthieu were able to stay at the Hôtel Corneille, which is the Hôtel des Princes in the Latin Quarter. Their room cost fifty francs a month; it was a nice room. There were two mahogany beds with red curtains, and two armchairs, and several chairs, and a glass cabinet to hold the books, and even (God forgive me!) a rug. These gentlemen ate at the hotel; the pension was not bad there at 75 fr. per month. Food and board absorbed Uncle Yvon's two hundred francs; Matthew provided for other expenses.[Page 6] His age did not allow him to attend the Normal School a second time. He said to his brother: “I am going to prepare for the exams for the Bachelor of Arts. Once fired, I will write my theses for the doctorate, and Doctor Debay will one day or another obtain a replacement in some faculty. You, you will do your medicine or your law, you are free.

And money? asked Leonce.

“I will mint money. I went to Sainte-Barbe and asked for lessons. I was accepted as tutor for the ninth and second graders: two hours' work every morning, and two hundred francs a month. I will have to get up at five o'clock; but we will be rich.

"And then," added Léonce, "you belong to the family of morning people, and it is a pleasure for you to wake up the sun."

Léonce chooses law. He spoke like an oracle, and no one doubted that he would make an excellent lawyer. He followed the lessons, took notes and wrote them down carefully; after which he dressed, ran around Paris, showed himself at the four cardinal points, and passed the evening at the theatre. Matthieu, dressed in a hazelnut overcoat that I can still see, listened to all the professors at the Sorbonne, and worked in the library in the evenings.[Page 7] Sainte-Genevieve. The whole Latin Quarter knew Léonce; no one in the world suspected the existence of Matthew.

I went to see them on almost all my outings; i.e. Thursday and Sunday. They lent me books, Matthieu worshiped Mme Sand; Léonce was a Balzac fanatic. The young professor relaxed in the company of François le Champi, Bonhomme Patience or the Bessons de la Bessonière. His simple and serious soul wandered dreamily in the reddish furrows of plows, in paths lined with heather or under the tall chestnut trees that shade the Mare au Diable. Leonce's restless spirit followed quite different paths. Curious to fathom the mysteries of Parisian life, eager for pleasure, light and noise, he breathed into Balzac's novels an intoxicating air like the scent of hot greenhouses. He followed with dazzled eyes the strange fortunes of the Rubempres, the Rastignacs, of the Henry de Marsays. He entered their clothes, slipped into their world, witnessed their duels, their love affairs, their enterprises, their victories; he triumphed with them. Then he came to look at himself in the mirror. “Were they better than me? Am I not worth them? What would prevent me from succeeding like them! I have their beauty, their spirit, an education[Page 8] they never had, and, what is even better, a sense of duty. I learned from college the distinction between good and evil. I shall be a De Marsay minus the vices, a Rubempre without Vautrin, a scrupulous Rastignac: what a future! all the enjoyments of pleasure and all the pride of virtue!” When the two brothers, with their eyes half closed, interrupted their reading to listen to some interior voices, Léonce heard the tinkling of the millions of Nucingen or Gobsek, and Matthieu the quivering sound of those rustic bells which announce the return of the herds.

We sometimes went out together. Léonce took us on the Boulevard des Italiens and in the beautiful districts of Paris. He chose hotels, he bought horses, he enlisted lackeys. When he saw an unpleasant face in a pretty coupe, he took us to task: "Everything goes wrong," he said, "and the universe is a stupid country." Wouldn't this car fit us a hundred times better?" He said us out of politeness. His passion for horses was so violent that Matthieu took out a subscription to the riding school for twenty pills. Matthieu, when we left him the task of driving us, was heading towards the woods of Meudon and Clamart. He claimed that the countryside is more beautiful than the city, even in winter, and the crows on the snow flattered more[Page 9] pleasantly his view that the bourgeois in the dung. Leonce followed us, murmuring and dragging his foot. In the depths of the woods, he dreamed of mysterious associations like that of the Thirteen, and he proposed that we league together for the conquest of Paris.

For my part, I made my friends take some curious walks. He has founded a small charity office at the Normal School. A membership fee of a few pennies a week, the proceeds of an annual lottery, and old school clothes make up a modest fund which is taken from every day without ever being exhausted. We distribute in the neighborhood a few printed cards representing wood, bread or broth, some clothes, a little linen and a lot of good words. The great utility of this small institution is to remind young people that misery exists. Matthieu accompanied me more often than Léonce on the winding stairs of the 12tharrondissement. Léonce said: “Misery is a problem whose solution I want to find. I will take my courage in both hands, I will overcome all my disgust, I will penetrate to the depths of these cursed houses where the sun and the bread do not enter every day; I will touch with my finger this ulcer which gnaws away at our society, and which has put it, very recently still, within a stone's throw of the[Page 10] tomb; I will know in what proportion vice and fatality work for the degradation of our species.” He said excellent things, but it was Matthieu who came with me.

He followed me one day in the rue Traversine, to a poor devil whose name I can't remember. I only remember that he was nicknamed Petit-Gris , because he was small and his hair was gray. He had a wife and no children, and he was stuffing chairs. We paid him our first visit in July 1849. Matthieu felt chilled to the core when he entered the Rue Traversine.

It's a street I don't want to say anything bad about, because it will be demolished in six months. But, in the meantime, it looks a little too much like the streets of Constantinople. It is located in a district of Paris that Parisians hardly know; it touches the rue de Versailles, the rue du Paon, the rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Geneviève; it runs parallel to rue Saint-Victor. Perhaps it is paved or macadamized, but I can't answer for anything: the ground is covered with chopped straw, debris of all kinds, and very much alive brats rolling around in the mud. To right and left rise two rows of tall, bare, dirty houses, pierced with little windows without curtains. Rather picturesque rags dot each facade,[Page 11] waiting for the wind to take the trouble to dry them. The rue de Rivoli is much better, but the Petit-Gris couldn't find a place to rent on the rue de Rivoli. He told us about his misery: he earned a franc a day. His wife wove mats and earned fifty to sixty centimes. Their accommodation was a bedroom on the fifth floor; their parquet, a layer of beaten earth; their window, a collection of oiled papers. I took out of my pocket a few coupons of bread and broth. Le Petit-Gris received them with a slightly ironic smile.

"Monsieur," he said to me, "you will forgive me if I meddle in what does not concern me, but I have the idea that it is not with these little cards that we will cure misery. Might as well put lint on a wooden leg. You took the trouble to climb my five floors with your friend, to bring me six pounds of bread and two liters of broth. Here we are for two days. But will you come back the day after tomorrow? It's impossible: you have something else to do. In two days I will therefore be on the same level as if you had not come. I'll be even more hungry, because my stomach is fierce the day after a good dinner. If I were rich like the rest of you—here Matthew dug his elbow into my side—I would arrange[Page 12] to get people out of business for the rest of their lives.

-And how? if the recipe is good, we will take advantage of it.

—There are two ways; one buys them a goodwill, or one procures for them a place of government.

"Shut up, then," his wife told him, "I always told you that you would do yourself harm with your ambition."

"Where's the harm, if I'm capable?" I admit that I always had the idea of ​​asking for a place. If I were offered ten francs to establish myself as a four-season merchant or to buy a fund of matches, I certainly wouldn't refuse, but I would always regret a little the job I have in mind.

"And what seat, please?" Matthew asked.

— Sweeper of the city of Paris. You earn your twenty sous a day, and you're free at ten o'clock in the morning at the latest. If you could get me that, my good gentlemen, I would double my earnings, I would have enough to live on, you wouldn't have to come up here with little cards in your pockets, and I'd go home to thank you. »

We didn't know anyone at the prefecture,[Page 13] but Léonce had met the son of a police commissioner: he used his influence to obtain the appointment of Petit-Gris. When we came to congratulate him, the first piece of furniture that struck our eyes was a gigantic broom whose handle was embellished with an iron hoop. The owner of this broom thanked us warmly.

“Thanks to you, he tells us, I am above need; my chiefs already appreciate me, and I do not despair of enrolling my wife in my brigade; that would be wealth. But there are two ladies on our landing who would really need your assistance; unfortunately their hands are not made for sweeping.

"Let's go see them," said Matthieu. “Let me talk to you first. They are not people like my wife and me: they have had misfortunes. The lady is a widow. Her husband was a wholesale jeweller, rue d'Orléans, in the Marais. He left for California last year with a machine he invented, a gold-finding machine; but the boat was wrecked along the way, along with the man, the machine and the rest. These ladies read in the papers that a match had not been saved. So they sold what little they had left, and they went to live in the rue d'Enfer; and then the lady had an illness that ate them all up. So they came here. They[Page 14] embroider from morning till night until their eyes die, but they don't earn much. My wife helps them with their housework when she has time: we are not rich, but we give alms with a helping hand to those who are in too much trouble. I tell you this to make you understand that these ladies do not ask anything of anyone, and that it will be necessary to put formalities in it to make them accept something. Besides, the young lady is pretty as a heart, and that makes you wild, as you understand.

Matthieu flushed at the thought that he might have been indiscreet.

"We will look for a way," he said. What is this lady's name?

—Madam Bourgade.

-Thank you."

Two days later, Matthieu, who had never wanted private lessons, set out to prepare a young man for the baccalaureate. He gave himself to it with such a good heart that his pupil, who had been refused four or five times, was accepted on August 18, at the beginning of the holidays. It was only then that the two brothers set off for Brittany. Before leaving, Matthieu gave me fifty francs. "I will be away for five weeks," he told me; I have to come back in October, for the start of the school year and for the exams[Page 15] of the license. You will go to the post office every Monday and you will take out a money order for ten francs, in the name of Madame Bourgade: you know the address. She believes that it is a debtor of her husband who discharges in detail. Do not show yourself in the house: you must not arouse the suspicions of these ladies. If one of them fell ill, the Petit-Gris would come and tell you, and you would write to me.”

I told you, you only read good feelings in Matthieu's little gray eyes. Why didn't I keep the letter he wrote to me during the holidays? She would make you happy. He depicted to me with naive enthusiasm the countryside gilded with gorse, the druidic stones of Carnac, the dunes of Quiberon, the sardine fishing in the gulf, and the flotilla of red sails harvesting oysters in the Auray river. All this seemed new to him, after a year of absence. Her brother was a little bored thinking of Paris. For him, he had found only pleasures. Her parents were doing so well! Uncle Yvon was so big and so fat! The house was so beautiful, the beds so soft, the table so lavish!—I I perhaps forgot to tell you that Matthieu ate for two.—“Do you know the only thing that saddened me? he wrote to mepostscript . I'll admit it to you, when you should be laughing at me. There is in the house[Page 16] two large sloths of rooms, well parqueted, well ventilated, well furnished, and which are of no use to anyone. I'm sure my uncle would rent them for nothing to an honest family who wanted to take them. And you pay a hundred francs a year to live in rue Traversine.”

Matthieu returned in October, and won, with flying colors, his bachelor of arts diploma. The marks of the examiners were so favorable to him that he was offered the chair of fourth at the Lycee de Chaumont; but he could not make up his mind to leave his brother and Paris. From time to time he gave me news from the rue Traversine: Madame Bourgade was unwell. You will only realize the interest he took in his invisible proteges if I initiate you into the great secret of his youth: he had not yet loved anyone. As his comrades had not spared him jokes about his ugliness, he was modest to the point of looking at himself as a monster. If anyone had tried to tell him that a woman could love him as he was, he would have thought they were making fun of him. He sometimes dreamed that a fairy struck him with her wand, and that he became another man. This transformation was the indispensable preface to all his romance novels. In real life, he passed by women without looking up: he was afraid that his sight would[Page 17] was unpleasant to them. The day he became the unknown benefactor of a beautiful young girl, he felt deep in his heart a humble and tender contentment. He compared himself to the hero of Beauty and the Beast , who hides his face and lets only his soul be seen; or to that pariah of the Indian Chaumière , who says, "You can eat of this fruit, I haven't touched it."

It was an unforeseen accident that brought him into the presence of Mlle Bourgade. He was at Petit-Gris asking for news when Aimée came in, crying for help. Her mother had passed out. Matthieu ran with the others. The next day he brought an intern from La Pitié. Madame Bourgade was ill only from exhaustion; we heal her. Petit-Gris's wife was installed in her home as a nurse. She was going to get the medicines and the food; and she knew how to haggle so well that she got them for nothing. Madame Bourgade drank an excellent Medoc wine which cost her sixty centimes a bottle: she ate ferruginous chocolate at two francs a kilogram. It was Matthew who performed these miracles and who did not boast about them. They saw in him only an obliging neighbour; they thought he was lodged in the rue Saint-Victor. The patient slowly got used to the presence of this young professor, who displayed the delicate attentions of a young girl. His caution[Page 18] maternal never warned against him; at most if she looked at him as a man. From the simplicity of his dress, she judged that he was poor; she was interested in him as he was interested in her. One Monday in December, she saw him come in a dark overcoat, without a coat, in the bitter cold. She told him, after long circumlocutions, that she had just received the sum of ten francs, and she offered to lend him half of it. Matthieu didn't know whether to laugh or cry: he had pledged his coat that very morning for those unfortunate ten francs. This is where they were after a month of knowledge. Aimée gave herself up less to the sweetness of intimacy. For her, Matthieu was a man. By comparing him to Petit-Gris and the inhabitants of rue Traversine, she thought him distinguished. Besides, at the age of sixteen, she had hardly had time to observe the human race. She was ignorant not only of Matthieu's ugliness, but also of her own beauty; there was no mirror in the house.

Madame Bourgade told Matthieu what he knew in part, thanks to the indiscretions of Petit-Gris. Her husband was doing poorly in his business and barely earning enough to live on when he learned of the discovery of California. As a man of sense, he guessed that the first explorers of this fortunate land would pursue gold bars and[Page 19] nuggets buried in rock, without taking the time to mine the gold sands. He thinks that the safest and most lucrative speculation would be to wash away the dust from the mines and the sand from the ravines. In this idea, he built a very ingenious machine, which he called, after his name, the Bourgade separator . To test it, he mixed 30 grams of gold powder with 100 kilograms of earth and sand. The separator reproduced all the gold, to within two decigrams. Strengthened by this experience, M. Bourgade collected the little he had, left his family enough to live on for six months, and embarked on the Belle-Antoinette , from Bordeaux, by the grace of God. Two months later, the Belle-Antoinette lost body and belongings, leaving the pass of Rio de Janeiro.

Matthieu realized that, without making a trip to California, the late Bourgade's invention could be exploited for the benefit of the widow and her daughter. He asked Madame Bourgade to give him the plans she had kept, and I was asked to show them to a pupil from the Ecole Centrale. The consultation was not long. The young engineer said to me, after a second's consideration: “Known! this is the Bourgade separator. It is in the public domain, and the Brazilians make ten thousand of them a year in Rio de Janeiro. Do you know the inventor?

[Page 20]

“He died in a shipwreck.

—The machine will have floated; this is seen every day.”

I returned pitifully to the Hotel Corneille, to report on my embassy. I found the two brothers in tears. Uncle Yvon had died of apoplexy bequeathing all his property to them.

II
I kept a copy of Uncle Yvon's will. There she is:

“On August 15, 1849, Assumption Day, I, Matthieu-Jean-Léonce Yvon, healthy in body and mind and provided with the sacraments of the Church, wrote this testament and act of my last wishes.

“Foreseeing the accidents to which human life is exposed, and desiring that, if misfortune befalls me, my property be divided without dispute between my heirs, I have divided my fortune into two parts as equal as I could. know:

“1º A sum of fifty thousand francs yielding five per cent, and invested by M e Aubryet, notary in Paris;

“2º My house located in Auray, my moors, lands[Page 21] arable and immovable of all kinds; my boats, nets, fishing gear, arms, furniture, clothes, linen and other movable objects, all valued, in conscience and justice, at fifty thousand francs.

"I give and bequeath all of these assets to my nephews and godchildren, Matthieu and Léonce Debay, enjoining each of them to choose, either amicably or by lot, one of the two parts above designated, without resorting, under any pretext, to the intervention of lawyers.

“In the event that I should die before my sister Yvonne Yvon, wife Debay, and her husband, my excellent brother-in-law, I entrust to my heirs the care of their old age; and I trust that they will not let them want for anything, following the example that I have always given them.”

The partition was not long in being made, and there was no need to consult the lot. Léonce chose the money, and Matthieu took the rest. Léonce said: “What do you want me to do with poor uncle's boats? I would love to dredge for oysters or fish for sardines! I would have to live in Auray, and just thinking about it makes me yawn. You would soon learn that I am dead and the nostalgia for the boulevard has killed me. If, by luck or misfortune, I escaped destruction, all this small fortune would soon perish[Page 22] in my hands. Do I know how to rent land, lease a fishery, or settle association accounts with half a dozen sailors? I would let myself fly to the ashes of my fire. Let Matthew give me the money, I'll put it on a solid value that will bring me twenty to one. This is how I understand business.
