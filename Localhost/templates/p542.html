Employee training has become a very important aspect in the modern business world. Due to the increased competition of customers and high profit margins, many organizations have formulated training schedules for their employees. Training is aimed at developing employee skills and knowledge. We will write a custom Report on Impact of Training on Employee Development specifically for you for only $16.05 $11/page 301 certified writers online It is therefore associated with the achievement of organization’s goals and hence profits. Training enhances organizational development and performance. Training refers to the whole process of learning through which skills are sharpened, knowledge is acquired, concepts are developed, rules are elaborated, change of attitude is enhanced, and employee behavior is streamlined with the aim of improving employee performance. Employee development results from consistency in development where employees acquire more skills and knowledge. The knowledge acquired through employee training enables them to realize that they can perform better. Organizations conduct on-the-job training, and off-the-job training. On-the-job form of training is done when employees are trained while they perform their assigned task. On the other hand, off-the-job training is done by having employees out of their work for one or more training sessions. Employees resume their work after the training. Most of the employees will appreciate trainings that are aimed at enhancing their skills and career development. Appreciation of employee training by both the management and employees will enhance its productivity. Training programs that are valued by employees enhance their level of satisfaction, motivation, and commitment to the organization. The performance of employees will also improve with an increase in training sessions. Although there exist a debate on whether employee training enhances turnover or it increases commitment, training is vital for employee development. There are various impacts of training on both the organization and individual employees. Since employees are the most important publics of an organization, their training should be prioritized by organizations. With the above highlights on training, this report discusses the impact of training on employee development. Training enhances employee development in the sense that in enables them to performance better. According to Ameeq-ul-Ameeq (68), employee training is said to be effective when employee performance improves. According to the human capital theory, appropriate and proper training of employees enables the organization to yield high results. High organizational productivity can only be achieved when the performance of individual employees is increased. It is through training that employees learn the importance of being more active on their duties and/or to appreciate the diversity of the working environment. Appreciation of workplace diversity enhances teamwork. Hence, the achievement of organizational goals is enhanced. Training also enhances employee confidence. Chiaburu and Tekleab (604) argue that proper and consistent training of employees makes them more confident and accurate when performing their duties. Since confidence in work enhances proficiency, employees become more effective. Employees who are well trained do not fear the risk of tear and wear, errors, and scrap. Confidence also boosts the rate of output per individual employee. Employees are also likely to perform better with increased training since they require less supervision and correction. A considerable amount of time is lost as the supervisors and managers monitor the conduct of employees. Training improves performance especially on new employees, for instance, fresh college graduates and employees who turn from one career to another one. Since new employees have little or no practical experience on their jobs, they are likely to cause wastage, scrap, and errors. Such kinds of employees are also likely to increase the rate of accidents in an organization. It is such negative occurrences that make such employees perform poorly. Proper training is one that is conducted after a thorough research is conducted on employee training needs. According to Chiaburu and Tekleab (609), analysis of employees training needs will enhance the objectives of the training such that the training will enhance the skills required for the performance of a certain task. Workers learn how to use certain technology features to increase their efficiency. They learn how to avoid risks and consequently how to reduce health hazards and absenteeism. The ability to use certain machines enables learners to increase their rate of production and standardization of products. Increase in the number of days that employees are in a certain job enhances their productivity. Employees are also exposed to various situations and occurrences during training. Through education and instructions that employees receive in training, their experience is increased. Hence, they become more productive and accurate. Since employees learn how to reduce risks and/or protect themselves, it becomes quite easy for them to remain healthy and productive. Healthy employees have high performance levels. Organizations experience low performance because some skills are not learnt in school. Kennett (112) argues thatmost of the practical skills can only be achieved through the on-the-job training. Training also enhances employee commitment. Hence, they feel more attached to achieve good results for the organization. The current world of technology has resulted in fast changes in the job markets. According to Ameeq-ul-Ameeq (68), skills that are relevant in the job market today may be irrelevant tomorrow. For example, Ameeq-ul-Ameeq’s report found that some years ago, the typesetting machine was relevant in the market. However, with the wide adoption of computers in most of the institutions, the machine has become irrelevant. In the same way, those who used to operate these machines have also had their services lacking relevancy in the market. It is out of these constant changes in the service industry that makes training important. Kennett (112) argues that as technology changes, workers must also be trained on new skills required in the market. On-the-job and off-the-job trainings aim at equipping employees with the current and relevant technology. Some of the employees in organizations stay for many years in the organization without advancing their skills. In fact, the report found that most of the employees in many organizations still use obsolescent skills that they acquired from college more than 20 years ago. Products made by such employees may continue to lag behind in the market. Since most of the employees who are in their senior years are in managerial positions, their methods of administration may result in conflicts with the junior employees. Kennett (114) argues that some of the skills that old managers and supervisors use are focused on production rather than on employees. Training is therefore important to old employees since it equips them with modern skills that make them remain relevant in the market. Training enables all employees in an organization to read from the same book. When employees’ skills and knowledge are leveled, coordination in job performance is easily achieved. Old and new employees gain the ability to work together as a team. During the training session, the old employees and fresh graduates share their knowledge and skills. Divergent views on various strategies of performance are converted into a common agreement. Workers that are occasionally trained are able to refresh their skills. The report also found that a considerable number of employees working in organizations have not received any training during their term of service. In fact, some of the employees had spent more than twenty years without receiving any refresher training. Training of workers enables them to develop on their previous knowledge and skills. Chiaburu and Tekleab (604) assert that combination of previous knowledge and skills with modern skills acquired during regular training helps employees remain relevant and competitive. The employers are also looking for relevant and current skills and knowledge from the employees that they hire. An employee who does not show commitment in acquiring new skills and/or moving with time is likely to lose relevancy in the work place. The report found that many companies dropped most of the employees who worked as office assistants during the manual era. However, those who had acquired training on computer skills and applications were retained. Job structures and design are also changing with change in time. A piece of work that required five professionals to finish is currently being done by one person and with lesser time. This goal has been achieved through a revision of training curriculum and mechanization. Employees who receive consistent training from their organizations are able to align their skills with changes in the market. Enrichment of careers is therefore achieved through training. Training enables learners to acquire new knowledge and skills. In most of the organizations, job promotions are done with regard to employee wealth of knowledge and skills. An employee who has received more training relative to others is likely to score high in performance. Hence, he or she will be promoted. Promotion is part of career growth and development. In fact, even the competitor organizations hunt for employees with high levels of knowledge and skills. Kennett (113) argues that training may also work negatively for an organization since the more employees are trained, the more their marketability is increased. Training enables workers to become more committed to their job. Lack of employee training may result in increased turnover. Every employee who comes to an organization has a desire to grow and develop his or her career. Training will enable an employee to learn how to be committed to his or her organization. Commitment makes employees patient in working for one organization for a considerable amount of time. It enables employees to appreciate the process of organizational growth. They become patient to grow with it. Employee training enables workers to appreciate that the more one remains in an organization, the less likely that he or she will turn over. Through training, employees learn to appreciate conflicts and/or how to solve them. Cases of strikes and other forms of industrial actions are reduced. Job satisfaction is also enhanced through employee training. Employees would not want to turn over to other organizations that do not offer training. Employees who are occasionally trained on various topics and issues gain the required skills for promotion and reward. Such employees will always be waiting for the next training. Training will therefore enhance employee commitment. Employees will also be committed to implementing the skills that they learn from training sessions. Commitment will enable employees to correct their colleagues who make errors during the performance of their duties. Trained employees will work hard to ensure efficiency and accuracy. According to Chiaburu and Tekleab (606), relationship between employees that are occasionally trained is better relative to that of employees that are never taken through training. Job satisfaction has been associated with good employee working environment. Since employees are trained on conflict resolution, they are able to solve conflicts within the organization. Employees will also be satisfied with career development, promotions, and rewards. Training develops employee skills in handling complex tasks. The ability to handle complex problems makes the employee achieve a certain level of job satisfaction. When an employee realizes his or her importance and contributions towards the success of an organization, he or she appreciates it. Improvement of knowledge and skills makes the employees have the capacity to seek better remuneration. With a better pay and terms of service, employees are able to live a better life relative to the period before training. Organizations that offer consistent trainings to their employees also indicate to them that there is a brighter future. Employees want to stick to an organization with a promising future. No employee would want to remain in an organization that will collapse or turn into receivership within the next few years. Chiaburu and Tekleab’s report also found that job commitment improves with the duration of employment and the age of the employee. Employees who are sure of a secured source of income in the future are able to invest in their careers. They feel obligated to their organization. Training has been credited with increased employee commitment. On-the-job training enables organizations to nurture employee talents. This report realized that job turnover is higher in junior employees than with older employees. Employee turnover reduces with an increase with age and period of service. In some cases, junior employees will turnover from a job due to lack of sufficient support during induction. Chiaburu and Tekleab (607) argue that employees who are well trained during induction have their talents nurtured. As a result, they are less likely to turn over from their jobs. However, employees who receive training from their employers are able to adapt to the working environments in an organization. Individual employee skills are also nurtured during training. Various areas of employee development are addressed during training. Great talents are also developed and maintained. For example, employees with management talents are trained on the best practices. Talents are enhanced through training. Kennett (2013, p.112) argues thattraining onvarious topical issues enhancesknowledge and skills, thus making talents more professional. Young, ambitious, and talented employees are also retained through training. Training enables employees perfect their skills. Employees that are trained enjoy their work and develop a positive attitude towards work. Employees also get more involved in their jobs after they are trained. Training also enables employees to appreciate their contribution in jobs that they do. It is through training that employees learn to appreciate their contribution to the organization. Hence, an organization gives open forums to employees. In turn, they are able to express themselves fully. In such forums, employee talents are realized. Talent realization also happens during the actual performance of the job. The spirit and enthusiasm that employees develop during training enables them to nurture their talents. Employees are also trained on how to make their talents work for them. Through training, employees learn how to select the right careers for themselves hence maximizing the impact of their talent. For instance, an employee may be working in the communication department of an organization as an editor. However, he or she may not be talented in editing but in public speaking. During training, talents are realized. Such an employee is able to appreciate his or her public speaking skills in an attempt to move to the sales promotion sub-department where he or she maximizes his or her skills. According to Ameeq-ul-Ameeq (68), talents enhance productivity of employees. Employees are able to develop their talents and careers to another level. Such talent makes an organization outstanding in the market amidst tight competition. Employee development is also enhanced through training on communication and conflict resolution. Through training, employees have their communication skills enhanced. They are able to interact with their supervisors, management, and colleagues in a better way. Cases of conflicts are also reduced since the employees can already appreciate each other. Training also enables employees to learn how to avoid and solve internal conflicts. Conflicts between employees are also reduced in trained employees. Trained employees know how to relate with each other in the workplace. Unity of purpose and socialization is also raised through training. Employees work like a team. As a result, their unity enhances their performance. Proper, clear, and complete communication in the working environment enables employees to open up to each other, hence boosting work coordination. Workers that are trained also learn from each other in an open way. Each employee minds about the other’s welfare. Hence, there exists a tight organizational culture. Employees who have been trained on various issues identify with each other. This identity further enhances socialization in an organization. The report also found that conflicts are more rampant in organizations that do not provide for employee training. Employees that undergo regular trainings acquire skills on how to communicate with each other together with how to communicate with their supervisors and their seniors. In most cases, conflicts arise from misunderstanding and lack of communication. According to Kennett (112), through proper communication skills, employees are able to articulate their grievances in a professional and acceptable manner. The management and supervisors are also able to respond to the need of the employees in the right way and on time. It is for this reason that organizations that conduct regular employee training have few conflicts. Trained employees also appreciate the need for dialogue on various matters. Dialogue enables the parties in conflict to solve their problems in an amicable way instead of rising against each other and destroying the reputation of their organization. Barrett and O’Connell (649) argue that trained employees are also more loyal to their organizations relative to untrained employees. Trained employees understand the whole process of leaders. They understand the financial position of their organization. They understand their profit margins. Therefore, they are likely to demand what they understand is their rightful share. Trained employees also know the right channels of conflict resolution. They are therefore less likely to soil the image of their company by seeking other methods of solving conflicts. Training also enhances diversity among employees. Employees are trained to accept diversity in terms of gender, age, race, tribe, and sexual orientation among others. Acceptance of diversity in the workplace enhances teamwork and/or reduces conflicts. During training, employees are occasionally reminded of the need for teamwork. Employees who work in organizations, which carry out training sessions, acquire socialization skills. They can work with diversified groups of people. Training develops employee communication skills. Employees with developed communication skills understand how to make the right choice of words. Wrong choice of words in communication results in conflicts among employees. Training equips employees with skills on how to communicate effectively. Correct, concise, and clear communication skills are enhanced through training. Communication promotes understanding in the organization. Learners develop skills on how to handle various publics of the organization. Employees who are trained on communication are able to carry out audience analysis before packaging communication materials for them. Appropriate training on communication enables employees to select the right channels of communication for different publics. For example, employees develop skills to choose on communication channels that have a wide reach, fast, and/or use a language that the target audience understands. Every public receives the right communication appropriate for its needs. With proper training, organization culture is nurtured. Employees become part of a larger communication family in the organization. Through training, employees learn how to deal with their weaknesses, how to reduce errors, and how to avoid product wastage. One of the major aims of training is to reduce errors. Employees who are not sure of certain methods of production are likely to make errors in delivering their services. Errors increase with a change in technology and methods of production. Kennett (112) argues that lack of training increases the chances of errors in the process of production. Guesswork in delivery of services can cost the company its money, time, and reputation. Barrett and O’Connell (647) argue that errors reduce the quality of products and services that a certain company produces. Employee training ensures that employees are introduced to new methods of production, new technology, and/or are trained on how to make the best use of it. An employee who is occasionally trained is not likely to forget the process of service or product manufacturing. Training acts as a constant reminder of various aspects of service delivery to the employees. Training enables employees to develop an active mind that guides them on accuracy, hence enabling them avoid errors. Employers want employees that will maximize profits while reducing losses. Since employees are human beings, they are bound to personal and professional weaknesses. During training, employee weaknesses are addressed. The areas where employees face difficulties while working are addressed. As a result, the employee develops new and more elaborate skills in handling tasks. Professionalism in the delivery of duties is enhanced through training. Every employee who is constantly trained becomes more professional with increased training. Barrett and O’Connell (650) further affirm that employees are reminded of various standards of operation during training. Trained employees are therefore strong in the way they perform their duties. Training aims at turning the weaknesses of employees into strengths. Employees who understand their weaknesses can easily come out of them and turn them into strengths. Strongly willed employees are likely to yield better results in performance since they are sure of their work and expectations. The amount of scrap that results from employees that are constantly trained is also reduced. Trained employees rarely make professional mistakes. The number of errors that such employees make is also reduced. Training enables employees to reduce scrap. During training, employees gain knowledge and skills on how to reduce errors that may result in total damage of goods and services. Efficiency of production is therefore increased with a reduction in scrap. Employees with high levels of accuracy are also likely to be rated high during appraisals. Employees who receive occasional training develop their efficiency skills. Efficiency of employees saves time. Time is an important factor in the production of goods and services. Training enables employees to learn how to plan, execute, and evaluate programs. Time wastage is reduced when employees are able to carry out their duties efficiently. Training enhances employee accuracy. Accuracy enhances efficiency of production. When employees are confident of the kind of work that they should do and the expectation of their work, they are able to save time. Barrett and O’Connell (647) observe that employee productivity highly depends on their level of efficiency. Training enables the employee to acquire knowledge and skills on how to use machines in the process of production. Mechanization and adaptation of modern technology will further enhance employee productivity. During training, employees are trained on how to automate and use machines to achieve high rates of production. Employees who are able to use technology enable their companies to be better competitors in the market. Mechanization of labor increases the speed of production. Training also enhances retention of the best employees in the organization. Employees would want to remain in an organization that promotes their career development and/or one that enhances their productivity. By having the right people in the organization, it becomes easier to attain organizational goals on time. Some experienced employees who turn over from organizations due to lack of opportunities for growth and development hurt the efficiency of organizations. Therefore, it is important to train employees in order to develop their skills and knowledge thereby reducing turnover rates. Employees who undergo training are not likely to turn over to other careers. Retention of employees in one career for a long period enhances their mastery in their area of specialization. Specialization enhances efficiency in the performance of duties. Employees are trained on how to be the best service providers in their areas of specialization. Increased repetition in performance of duties enables the employee to be more efficient in performance of duties. Training enables these employees to be confident in performance of their duties. Confidence enhances efficiency of performance of duties. Efficiency of employees is also enhanced through training on conflict resolution. Organizations waste lot of time in solving conflicts between the management and employees and among the employees. Conflicts are also a great source of de-motivation to the employees. Barrett and O’Connell (647) affirm that through training, employee efficiency is enhanced since employees are taught on how to solve simple conflicts. Training enables them to acquire skills in mediation, conflict management, and resolution. Workers who undergo regular on-the-job and off-the-job training are able to manage differences among them. Workers are also trained on how to mediate in cases of conflict among employees and between employees and supervisors. When employees work with little or no stress, their efficiency is enhanced. Such employees can make high quality products. They can avoid cases of accidents. Based on the expositions made in this study, it is evident that training is crucial in employee development. Every employee has developmental needs such as advancing knowledge and skills, learning how to communicate well, achieving job satisfaction, achieving higher pay and reward, having the ability to solve and manage conflicts, advancing their talents, acquiring of skills in the application of modern technology, being more proficient in work, and becoming more productive. This report realized that both on-the-job and off-the-job training are able to achieve all these developmental needs. Organizations that organize occasional employee training are able to achieve high profit margins. Such organizations are also able to compete well in the modern markets. Therefore, this report realized that every organization should invest in training of its workforce in order to nurture skills for the current market and for the future. Employees who are occasionally trained develop confidence and accuracy in their jobs hence reducing errors and scrap. Training also nurtures proper communication skills. Organizations with employees who have well developed communication skills are able to nurture organizational culture. Therefore, this report finds that training of employees is important for the purposes of developing their knowledge, skills, and abilities.
