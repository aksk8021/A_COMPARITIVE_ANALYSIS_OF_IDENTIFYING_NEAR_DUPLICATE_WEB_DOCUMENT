In the middle of a large pine forest between Baarn and the Vuursche lay on a hill, completely hidden in the greenery, a nice wooden villa. There was a balcony around the whole house, which made it look a lot like a Swiss house. Only the roof stood out above the trees, and when you looked out of the skylight you had a delightful sight all around. You could clearly see the towers of Amersfoort, Soest, Bunschoten and more surrounding villages. You saw very nicely the White Palace of Queen Emma and a little to the right the Needle of Waterloo.

Mr Bergwoude, head teacher of the boarding school "Sparrenheide," lived in that high house. When Mr. Bergwoude went to school, he only had to go down the hill, on which[ 6 ]his house had been built and to cross the forest road, for the schoolhouse was just across the street.

The schoolroom was not big, it consisted of only two classes and a gym. But it was no ordinary school either. Only children who could not learn as quickly as other boys and girls came to 'Sparrenheide'. Some because they were always sickly at home, others because they were nervous or had previously had some illness, which later prevented them from remembering so well.

And we will see in this book why they couldn't learn at a normal school , but could learn at 'Sparrenheide' .

Mr. and Mrs. Bergwoude were very nice people, both of whom loved children very much. They had three children, all boys. At the moment when this story begins, Saturday morning school had just ended and the boys and girls, in so far as they were not in "pension" with Mr. Bergwoude, went home.

Also the three sons of the head teacher, Hans, Flip and Rob. Hans was thirteen years old, a big, strong boy with broad shoulders and a pair of arms like an athlete. He was quite a fellow for his age, and what he couldn't do with his black eyes he made up for with his muscular fists.

Flip counted twelve years, he was also a thoroughly healthy boy, but not as stubby and sturdy as Hans, Flip was a straight fun-maker, he loved[ 7 ]a lot of jokes and often knew how to say all kinds of nice things, which made everyone laugh. Ten-year-old Robert, commonly known as Rob, was a weirdo. You couldn't really make sense of him. He was a bit quiet; he loved his parents and his brothers very much, but perhaps even more so the woods and the heath with the plants and animals. He made quite a study of it, and almost always in his spare hours he could be found in the woods with his botanizing drum and plant spade, or arranged his collected plants and insects in his room. But that did not alter the fact that he still had the same cheerful mood of his brothers, although he was also less noisy and busy. He could join in their jokes and play as well as other boys, but he always remained calm. And why was he a weirdo now? Well, in the first place he was terribly sloppy at everything. Not only to his clothes and books, his plants and animals, but also surprisingly indifferent to other things. For example, he didn't care at all if he was an hour late for school or for dinner. All the scoldings, punishments and admonitions helped little or nothing. Sometimes he intended to suddenly become terribly neat, but then made it so bad that he walked on his stockings so as not to get his shoes dirty. He was also very forgetful. All things considered, Rob had the potential to become a professor. All the scoldings, punishments and admonitions helped little or nothing.

All things considered, Rob had the potential to become a professor.

Lo and behold, now the three merry brothers have been introduced. As said, they had just left school and were going home. Through the garden, which was laid out on the slope of the hill, they entered the living room,[ 8 ]whose wide French doors were wide open. They found their mother busy setting up the coffee table and, according to true custom, she was firstly grabbed by her three boys. All three of them did so with vigor and force. Then they looked with longing eyes at the stacks of sandwiches and Flip said in a confidential tone:

"Help us out quickly, little mother, we are in a great hurry!"

"Yes," added Hans, "we still have so much to do and must be there early."

"I don't even need to eat," said Rob.

"What shall we experience now?" asked mother, 'why so hasty? And why go without food? That's not happening! What's going on then?"

"Those are great secrets, Mother," said Flip.

"State secrets," said Hans.

"Oh come on," pleaded Rob for his mother, "we can tell Mother."

At this moment their father came in. Mr. Bergwoude was a man with a friendly appearance, he wore a long blond beard and his hair was blond too. Unlike him, their three sons were black, just like their mother.

"So, so," said the gentleman, placing a stack of school notebooks on a table, "and what are those state secrets that you should tell Mother? And then I can certainly hear them too?”

The brothers looked at each other, and then Hans said:

"We are going to war!"[ 9 ]

Flip and Rob nodded. Father and mother looked at each other.

"Wage war?" asked Father in astonishment. "What must that mean?"

"Well," explained Hans, "it's just a game. Our friends from the Baarnsche school are coming this afternoon through the Overbosch to "Sparrenheide" to storm and take our school. And now we have to act quickly to keep them at bay.”

Mr and Mrs Bergwoude laughed.

"Come on," said the first, "so this afternoon my school will be formally stormed? Well, I think I'll just telegraph to Amersfoort for a detachment of soldiers and hussars. And what time will that happen?”

"Yes, we just don't know, father," said Hans.

"Of course they don't say that," said Flip.

"No, they don't say that," Rob repeated philosophically.

"I hope the other boys at our school won't get too excited about that game," said Mr. Bergwoude, "because then there's no house with them tonight. They are now quietly using their twelve hours in the dining room.”

"Yes, what a miracle," said Flip nicely. "They don't know anything about it yet."

"Won't they join in?" asked father.

"Oh yes, but we won't tell you until we go to the woods. For so it is with the great army," said Hans. "The soldiers never know in advance what will happen."[ 10 ]

"But what about the plan?"

"Don't say," said Flip.

"That is a secret, Father, a secret," said Hans.

"A secret, yes, a secret," Rob repeated again.

And no matter how much Father and Mother tried to learn more of that secret, the three brothers said nothing, so that the parents had to content themselves with the announcement that the schoolhouse would be stormed by the enemy that afternoon.

And yet they yielded and made no objection to the merriment of the boys. They also always managed to come up with something new and played in the woods, as if they were their property instead of Kroondomein. With the kind cooperation of Father and Mother, the coffee table was over sooner than usual and the boys ran to their room.

Hans took out a hiking map of the woods and spread it out on the table.

"This is our topographic map," he said with a laugh. "I am the general, Flip and Albert de Hooge are my officers."

"What about me?"

"You are not old enough to be an officer, but I have a nice job for you. Because you are so well acquainted with every nook and cranny of the woods, you become my scout."

"That's fine," said Rob.

"Look here," said Hans, who was going to explain his plan like a general. „I have agreed with Bram Verhallen from Baarn that he will be with his troop at two o'clock[ 11 ]out of the village at Pekinglaan, which you can see on the map here. They then go through the spruce forest under the tunnels of the railway tracks through the Baarnsche forest. You see," he continued, pointing with his finger to the roads on the green map, "they go here through the Borlaan along the Groote Kom to den Eemnesser Straatweg. There they cross diagonally to the road along the Boterbergje. And from there they arrive at our school through the Overbosch. Well, of course I don't know which way they're taking, because Bram didn't tell me that."

"Should we just defend the school?" asked Flip. "I shoot them a batch of brown beans in their nostrils with my wooden saber and throw them back so that they roll from here to Baarn."

"Now stop your nonsense!" said Hans impatiently, „we could use our time better. Yes, we just have to defend the school, but we won't let them come so close at once. Our school is located here on the map. We have twenty boys. Five must stay with the school to guard it. Of course we don't take the biggest for that. Fifteen are with me. I know a nice place to stop Bram and his troop.”

"It's half past one now," said Rob. "I think I'll take my botanist drum with me."

"Are you baked square?" asked Flip, „there is nothing to botanize this afternoon, just botanize Bram Verhallen on his face!"

"No, take nothing but a good pair of eyes and a lot of cleverness," said Hans.[ 12 ]

Flip suddenly searched diligently in the drawer of the table.

"What are you doing?" asked Rob.

"I'm looking for a lot of cleverness," said Flip, "because I'm afraid I don't have enough of it in my cherry pit."

"If you're going to go talkin' in the woods like you do this afternoon," said Hans, "you'll mess everything up. And listen: The school is a fortress inhabited by Europeans. Bram and his boys are a wild Indian tribe, the Mohicans and Bram is Eagle Eye, their chief.”

"Then I want to be Soepoog," said Flip.

"You can get a black eye from me at once," growled Hans, who was all seriousness and fire. "We're not getting along at all with your stupidity. See, and now we're going to warn the others."

The three brothers went to the boarders' rooms to inform them of the matter.

Of course they all wanted to participate, but Hans chose the toughest boys to go with them, the rest could guard the school.

"I'd like to be an Indian too," Flip muttered to himself. „Akibakki frogbokki, I already know the language! Ha, thou triple puffed dogs of pale-faced, I, the brave Soupoog, will chop thee with my tomohawk into gruel with raisins and green soap. Woe unto you, you grunts!”[ 13 ]

Indians and Whitefaces.
OBram Verhallen gathered his men on the Brinkplein near the Baarnsche church. Bram Verhallen was the same age as Hans Bergwoude, just as strong, just as smart, just as solidly built. Only he was light blond and had soft, almost dreamy eyes. He was a big boy of a boy, but he wouldn't let himself eat the cheese off the bread. Hans Bergwoude was one of his best friends, and if they hadn't lived so far from each other, they would have been together much more. Bram was the only son of notary Verhallen; although he came from a dignified family, he was nevertheless free from all contrivance or affectation. He was a diligent student at school, but had to block quite a bit to keep up. He revived when he could romp with his comrades.

Meanwhile more and more boys showed up, and all were nervous with impatience to begin the delightful game. Then warriors, about[ 14 ]twenty in number, were complete, Bram put himself at the head of it and marched to Torenlaan, where he turned right into Sparrenbosch. There he paused, had the boys stand in a circle around him, and went to explain the game.

"You already know a little bit," he said, "what we are going to do, but you will only now hear the finer points. We are Indians of the tribe of the Mohicans.”

"Hurrah, hooray, Indians!" a few already shouted.

"Be quiet!" exhorted Toon Sprits, a big boy and one of Van Bram's classmates. "Beautiful Indian Ways to Scream in the Woods!"

"Yes," said Bram, "if you make such a spectacle, the 'Sparheiders' will immediately hear where we are. So guys, keep quiet. You've all read enough Indian books, and that's why you know how Indians do in their forests. I'm Arendsoog, and you just pick one name for yourself.”

"Tigerclaw is my name!" said one.

"White Buffalo!" cried a second.

"fire beam!"

"Noble Heart!"

„Apecake! Deep-fried raisin bun! Coconut fat!” It was a lot of yelling again. In this way, the whole enterprise came to nothing.

"Silence!" commanded Bram. “Whoever disobeys and shouts or makes life again can go home.”[ 15 ]

That helped. Bram was a good boy, but when he got angry, his muscular arms started to speak a word and the boys respected that! So it became quiet and Bram continued:

„I am Arendsoog and your chief. Toon Sprits and Jan vd Zee are my spies. The Bergwoude school in the Overbosch is a fortress where white people live. That fortress is being stormed by us. But it is defended by the Sparheiders, which is Hans Bergwoude with his brothers and the boarders. They know that we come from the direction of the Boterbergje.

“ All Sparheiders have a white band on their arm, and I have brought red bands for us. Here they are. Tie them about the right arm!”

That was soon done and Bram then divided his troop.The striker led the way, Jan vd Zee with two boys. Jan in the middle of the road, the two boys behind the trees, behind them a front group of three men on the road, then a troop of ten men and fifty yards behind it a rear guard as cover for four boys.

Each section had to keep in touch with the others. And furthermore Bram told his warriors everything they had to know for this afternoon.

If the joy of hearing this pleasant game had made the boys noisy for a few moments, now they realized that they must be dead silent. They played in the woods every week and knew their way as well as in their own house.

After Bram had set up his troop, it went into the[ 16 ]said order forward, into the woods.

Arrangement of the boys on the avenue.
Meanwhile, Hans Bergwoude, the general of the Sparheiders, who had to defend the fortress of the whites, did not sit still either. He had five defenders set up in a wide circle around the school building and with fifteen men he marched against the attackers. That is, he first divided them into three batches. Five boys led by his brother Flip marched against the enemy through Sophialaan, five under the command of Albert de Hooge through Hooilaan and five under himself through Koninginnelaan, so in the middle of the other two troops. Each party had to have one of the boys run among the trees to carry messages or signs from left or right. At the end of each avenue the troops would halt and there close the entrance to the enemy. There were still more roads that led to Sparrenheide,[ 17 ]

Hans knew this too, so he had occupied the main roads to Sparrenheide.

It was quiet in the forest.

Hikers were hardly to be seen, they seldom came that far and mostly stayed in the vicinity of the village. The sun shone gleefully on this fine July day, and in the woods there was a lovely sun under the trees. Blackbirds and thrushes sang in the tops of the beeches and linden, yonder a few squirrels jumped between the spruce branches, but otherwise it was dead silent. More beautiful places than where the boys moved through the forest can hardly be imagined. The gray-brown paths wound in all directions and then disappeared into the thousand-hued forest green. The light leafy green of the linden stood next to the brown beech, dark spruce and pine in between, and suddenly another group of soft green oaks, it was constantly a different shade of tree foliage. Sometimes the trees parted and surrounded a clearing, where a pond was formed. A pond of clear water, in which you saw salamanders and snakes and beautiful aquatic insects. The bottom was covered with millions of leaves, which formed beautiful nests for the pond inhabitants.

The boys, too, were now enjoying that glorious forest splendor, but for the moment they were more filled with the afternoon's play.

Without making any unnecessary noise, the three troops advanced through the avenues. General Hans understood that he was not dealing with ordinary soldiers, but with Indians, who, in real Indian fashion,[ 18 ]suddenly appear from behind trees and shrubs. That is why he had taken the precaution of letting some of his males walk not on the paths, but among the trees.

At last the three troops had reached the terminus of the said avenues and took cover there, that is, they hid among the undergrowth and placed a sentry behind a tree on the lookout. Each troop was to remain in place and bivouac there for the time being.

General Hans now wanted to know how the enemy was doing, and so he called his scout Rob to him.

"Look, Rob," he said, "you must go further into the woods to the side of Butterberg and see if there is anything to be seen of the Indians. But be careful, you know, and don't bother with all kinds of snails and beetles and flea beetles and I don't know what kind of vermin anymore! Remember that such an Indian is waiting for you, and before you know it you're done. And be back in about half an hour. Can you cry like a crow?”

"Better than you."

"That's still there. If something is wrong, let out a crow's cry. Then we come. Zoe, now go.”

Rob went into the woods and was soon gone among the trees.

Hans went from one troop to another along the connecting lane. He made sure that the sentries[ 19 ]were at their post. But he soon saw that they were diligently doing their duty, for they were far too afraid of being attacked by the Indians unexpectedly. He resolved, therefore, to calmly occupy the lanes and, before continuing, to await Rob's return and to hear what the opposing party had seen.

The Indians had advanced cautiously through the forest. Jan vd Zee, who took the lead, with a friend on each side between the trees, thought he could detect danger at the four-fork junction of Boslaan past the Groote Kom. He beckoned to his associates and raised his arm, which was seen by those behind him. They passed on the signal, and suddenly all the Indians halted and flung themselves flat on the ground, covered as much as possible among the bushes.

Jan, who identified himself as a true Indian by the great name Tigerclaw, saw some boys moving among the undergrowth straight ahead. Would the defenders of Sparrenheide have penetrated that far already? Was it an outpost? But in vain Tigerclaw searched for the white band which the adversary had to wear on his arm. The boys also seemed to be engaged in a very different game. And while Tigerclaw watched the strange shapes among the trees, Eagle's Eye, the valiant chief of the Mohicans, waited for another sign.

"Could Tigerclaw see the pale faces yet?" whispered[ 20 ]Eagle's Eye Toon Sprits in the ear, now called Firebeam.

"Firebeam knows it no more than the valiant chief, but Eagle's eye can see for miles, he can go forward and see why Tigerclaw goes no farther."

“My brother speaks wisely. I will go. Hugh! there Tigerclaw again gives the signal: forward.”

Indeed Tigerclaw swung his arm forward, the strangers had been no enemies, and the Indians crept silently along the paths again.

Thus they reached Boterbergje.

The Boterbergje is a small hill, located on a side path of the Eemnesser street. It is surrounded by two rows of trees, on three sides behind them thick undergrowth stretches for a great distance, only the side of the road was open. On top of the mound stood a humped, gnarled linden tree.

Arendsoog encamped his Indian warriors in the densely grown terrain around Boterbergje, so that not a tip of their noses could be seen. He himself crawled up and climbed a tree. But he couldn't see much, it was all woods and woods again. Only he could see a little bit of the highway to the northeast. He was just about to climb out of the tree again when he saw the bushes move in a place where his Indians were not encamped. Eagle Eye held its breath and kept its sharp eagle eye fixed on the bushes.

In the next moment he saw an arm[ 21 ]come, and on that arm ... a white band!

So an enemy!

But was he alone? Was it not a strong detachment that had been sent ahead to stop Eagle's Eye? No, that was not likely, Sparrenheide was still far away.

So it would be a scout!

But then Arendsoog would also see to it that the pale face did not return to his general!

Silent . . . a head appeared among the greenery, but the scout was still too far away to make out his face. He looked around. Then he ducked back into the green.

Eagle Eye slipped silently from the tree. He crept down the hill and beckoned his warriors Tigerclaw and Firebeam. A single whisper was enough to inform these two, and suddenly the three Indians flew into the undergrowth to capture the spy. They had spotted him soon enough, and now a hunt began through the oak grove. Fifty meters away lay the pine forest, if the fugitive tried to escape there he was lost.

The Indians flew through the difficult terrain, they saw the pale-faced Rob Bergwoude approaching the forest more and more.…

He ran in there!

Lo and behold, the innumerable trunks growing closely together would hinder his rapid progress.

And, somewhat calmer, the redskins followed the fugitive. They too now reached the pine forest.[ 22 ]

But… where was the pale face?

Eagle Eye, Tigerclaw, and Firebeam looked around in surprise. They looked at the tops of the trunks, they kicked the pine branches from the ground.

Nothing!

Rob Bergwoude had disappeared without a trace!

Fighting the Redskins.
Rob, who had been sent out to reconnoitre by his brother Hans, had moved into the woods through Koninginnelaan. The young nature lover was just right for this work, because he knew all the roads and hiding places through and through. He regularly walked to the Jagerskom, also a forest pond. There he saw a stubby old mother sitting on a bench by the water, weeping bitterly.

Rob had a soft heart, and he hated it so much to see this old woman cry that he couldn't bring himself to keep walking.

Maybe she had dropped something in the water?

Rob came a little closer and only then did the old man seem to notice him.[ 24 ]

"Is ... are you a little lost?"

The poor mother wiped the tears from her eyes and nodded.
