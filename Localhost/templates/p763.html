Husband Landen listened with a smile. He had taken care of his sons before. Could it not be agreed that this monster would be locked in the hold of a ship to be gnawed at by rats, which would surely take away all the evil guts from him? Would it not be agreed that this beast should still be alive, while at the same time promising that he would never again step into the lovely and peaceful city of M. Prefect, adorned by its brave police force. - Au Reservoir , sir, I would be in a hurry with the shipbuilding. I will immediately start vigorously punishing the villains.

The preference left with satisfaction. Preference also disappeared from fear, as the situation had already begun to become threatening. As usual, the poke had accidentally dropped all sorts of harder objects from the top of the mast at the feet of the forefront. Jack attacked the dominance of the navy, and one of the men fingered the overripe melon, nervously distracted. The mood was against the French colonial administration and it also caused Charles, who was painting the side of the ship, to accidentally fall on the rowers dressed in prey.

The hero of the story was a little moved by this. He had even finished his breakfast and was now sitting in the front door with a happy stupid look on his face. He had had plenty of snacks with him on board. Didn't the captain want to?

No. The captain just wanted the chef to keep his carcass between the beards of "Amy Turner," otherwise it could happen that the chef would be made pork at a suitable occasion. And it would not be to throw pearls in front of pigs, assured Husband Landen, who was rarely angry, but whose word was also able to be given the necessary respect. The chef contented himself with his fate with a sad smile. Now the beauty was over, before he had even begun to begin. Oh, booze, what a prank you do to a clean man!

The next Saturday came, a wonderful Sunday morning came, which was wonderful only for the chef. For the rest of us, it reminded us of the disappearance of life’s delights, the deception of Montmartre’s steam, and the dizzying music of gingerbread.

The morning was really wonderful!

The green colors of the tropics were reflected on the calm surface of the lagoon. The city had not yet awakened, and the sounds of the jungle were clearly heard in the bright morning air. The water was a crystal that enclosed a miraculous richness of color. At low tide there was probably a market, as a large bunch of algae were swam from that imported fish, and at the other end the same amount flowed out, just like the market hall, the fat clump-mammals were shopping, and There was life and activity downstairs, but then the fish don’t know the copper smiths except from the copper hooks. After all, that too can be an unpleasant acquaintance.

Yes, the chef was now in the good spirit of the ship. He reconciled irritated minds and prepared a breakfast appropriate for the situation. He had sheepskin firmly on his shoulders again.

Fate organizes narrative cases in just a twist. It sent the hubby to Landen's land and offered the chef half a bottle of cognac through Jack's hand. The offer was gratefully accepted, and after half an hour the wolf had come out from inside the sheepskin.

In the afternoon there was a handsome molska and the cook disappeared overboard. The act was thoughtful as the clothes were in a beautiful pile on the front door and one of the lifebuoys on the bow deck was gone.

We peeked overboard. The chef cheers happily in the water with a lifebuoy as beautiful as the belly belt of a good cigar under his armpits. The chef was going ashore for M. Prefekt's Sunday dinner.

We shouted him back in vain. He whimpered only two times more terribly with his hands and feet and approached the beach suspiciously quickly. So the stage has to be moved there.

* * * * *

Mr Guiraud had had a successful morning. He had all day off, and his uniform was more shiny than usual. His mind was as shining bright as the sun peeking through the sky. Thoughts flew — so, what could such a mustache-like hussar dream of other than new cockroaches and the gentle eyes of a girl. His thoughts were, let’s say sublime, all the way to the waterfront promenade of the lagoon.

In it he stopped and lamented that the sword had been forgotten at home. For verily there was a white figure floating in the blue water, which could not belong except to the dog who had favored him in the chair a week earlier! Oh, be a good shotgun now! He would sink such a ship in five minutes and distribute the meat to the dogs of Papete. Ah, ah, and he ran helplessly along the beach.

The chef came from there, bursting with water like a whale. The water was sweet, the algae itched so wonderfully from the lower body and the fish below seemed to learn his swimming skills with interest, as they waved their tails at a fast pace. He began to float and peek at his slender toes. They moved so somewhat in their joints.

Only when he turned did he notice a face on the beach that felt so familiar, then squirted a long burst and showed how the duck was diving. He lingered for a long time, probably thinking of a suitable greeting, because then we heard the following dialogue:

- Who are you walking like an old cow on your false legs?
Go sit in a tree and they will think you are a monkey.
- Aha, are you a villain! You are naked even uglier than in the moonlight. Come a little closer so I can throw you a rock. Or I'd rather hang it around your neck. Tui, tui, darling, we have one hippopotamus place open at the zoo.

- Step into the water, cow. Come swim so I can bite a small piece of your red nose in memory. We have a fourth foot on the ship in the chair, three feet of which you can still remember well.

The conversation continued at an ever-increasing pace until the bird of paradise on the beach was about to suffocate. The chef spun happily in the clear film of water. He had no worries, distress and rage were on the beach. So he calmly continued to examine his toes, however, intermittently hitting appropriate remarks from the Tahitian police.

A large crowd of spectators soon gathered on the beach. The Gentiles had fun. This was almost even more fun than cockfighting. At least it was cheaper. Ah, be like this every day! Gingerbread started betting on who would last longer or who would rather burst into anger.

Eventually, the entire Papete police force joined it. There came M. Le Bellionek, who fervently demanded the arrest of this daredevil.

The police prefect was in trouble. The captain had been promised not to touch the man as long as he did not step ashore on his feet and now - the man had certainly not been ashore yet. Nothing would have been sweeter to M. The master than pulling that villain out of the ears to the ground. He would then point in the direction of the wreck's subsequent career. What to do? The police chief felt his ears heat up, as the remarks of the environment were quite rough in honor of the police department.

His conscience stretched like an elastic band. It stretched as far as the chef, then whispered back and struck me reminding me of the word given. The conscience eventually turned into a jumping ball that rose into the throat and hurried down from there upon hearing the friendly advice of the environment.

M. Le Bellione had disappeared from the crowd, as had a few other enthusiasts. Soon the boat was seen leaving the dock, and the fate of the chef was decided. The ears of conscience of the police chief dropped; it snoozed again. At least he wasn't to blame.

In honor of the chef, it must be said that he bravely defended the reputation of the ship. In the battle, a boat crashed and hunters were allowed to tow their prey to shore. It was a beautiful prey - a carcass of a naked man, from whose mouths rained down as a bubbling rapids. The women retreated in good order, as decency has spread so far. The men gathered around the screaming creature, and M. Le Bellione presented to the assembled people five hundred different ways to escape this frenzy. His imagination was so drained that the police chief finally had to be jealous of asking for a word of mouth.

The concepts of law here in the world are still straightforward and uncomplicated. Two minutes went to investigate the accused and half a minute to read the verdict. The city of Papete would make him an example to other fighting villains.

Ah, my heart fills me with remembrance of this man's suffering. He was dragged like a wild beast long into the woods. The hustle and bustle of the city was no longer there, the enraged pagan crowd was just making noise there. Even the last decoration - the lifebuoy - was removed from around the chef. He was tied to a palm tree, a kind of itchy trunk that, with every turn of the body, is reminiscent of a dog-sized flea. An ancient ceremony was then observed, each taking turns spitting a helpless victim face down. M. Le Bellione was honored to be the first to take on this pleasant task, and he did so so thoroughly and thoughtfully that the guiraud of Saliraud was preceded by twice as much saliva from his mouth.

After this simple but impressive celebration, the judges and hoe guests left for their everyday evening trees. However, Mr Guiraud still returned, supposedly checking the ties - and ashamed to say - he took the opportunity and continued to spend on his own account.

Elias coward! He had never felt so lonely. The evening still went on, but at night came the jungle in the corpore to greet him. Frogs came, mosquitoes came, all kinds of tailed and tailless creatures came to see this miracle, and Elijah hoped to be an earthworm, 300 meters below the ground. The frogs licked the dew off his toes, the mosquitoes made new breath holes in him, and a pair of furry creatures descended in the darkness of the darkness to whisper his tail. There may have been dogs, but they might as well be gorillas.

I don’t burden the description with horror pictures. I’m just telling you that night made Elijah a new man. It planted sheepskin around him indelibly tight. The wolf could no longer invade, the easy-going man was Elias, the cook, but before the rays of the morning sun began to race in the palm grove, he had become a truly easy-going man who did no harm to anyone at that age.

The night in the tropics can be wonderful, it can make the mind so strangely fluctuate and push the mind into a flood of tender, sweet thoughts, but Fate can use it for other purposes as shown here.

When he arrived on the ship, he had a thousand plans in mind to improve his habits. We tried for three weeks to soak them away from him, but in the end we got tired.

No Destiny will ship around just summing up. It puts the bad men of the ship on the other beak of the pound to sway and the good men of the ship are seated in the second horizontal cup and then see if the ship is worth sinking. "Amy Turner" got to sail without worries as long as she had a chef with her. He eventually became such a good man that he alone took care of the good side of the pound. In hard places, when the Creator nudged the ship like a beggar in a sea hissing with anger, the chef received a friendly applause from the scribe. For the rest of us unfortunate, who were swinging in a fully crammed second horizontal cup, he had only a sad look to offer.

TWO REBELLION COMPANIES
Captain MacDonald was the most bullying person I have ever met on my hikes. His whole greasy essence aroused disgust, his neck was in a thousand wrinkles, and indeed a malicious look dwelted in the small drizzle. A legacy of a real Scotsman, saita and greedy.

After this explanatory preface, I will talk about the cases that were about to end his career as a captain for a sudden compulsory swim. He must thank him for his life for the fact that this century no longer knows about piracy and, I think, that we had been taught to respect the law and authority from an early age.

We had been lied to from the harbor. The ship was to be a new, strong ship, the rigging to be feathered lightly, and life was promised to sweeten with storms and free night food. I still remember the captain's face well. He had collected a dozen of us in the mouth of Kapaka's door, and in a honey-sweet voice explained to us the wonders of life at "Elinor." The payout was promised right away in Honolulu, and let him still promise to arrange, through his acquaintances, so that we can still get a fuss from there to the United States. A slick man, that MacDonald. He spoke to us even before he was really excited.

It was all really our own fault. "Elinor" lay on a full load of carbon for Honolulu, had been lying for a full week, and there was no information about the crew yet. The ship was boycotted openly in the shorelines, and even the wretched wrecker felt his heart curl as he talked about the captain's horror and bad luck. "Elinor" had come from Cape Town, and there were only five of the eight men left when it arrived in Newcastle, Australia. That in itself was a bad sign. It was further reported that the men had mysteriously disappeared, two from the helm and one from the reconnaissance. So we boarded the ship that was marked, but we felt it in our skins as well.Peru, A Land of Contrasts
INTRODUCTION
Any statement regarding Peru implies a contrary statement equally valid. Contrast is its characteristic quality, true as to the general aspects of the country and ramifying through remote details. It is the obvious point of view from which to study Peru.

The three parts of this book—the desert, the mountains, the jungle—are the three natural divisions of the country. The shore is a long, narrow desert, much diversified. In a fertile valley intersecting it lies Lima, The City of the Kings. The river has come from the Andes, on whose lofty tablelands, called jalca in the north and puna in the south, flourished remote civilizations filled with mystery. Beyond the mountain barrier lies the jungle, geographically the largest portion of Peru,{4} and like all other jungles a region of dread and fascination.

Peru is a low country lying under a mild sky; but above are the mighty Andes freezing under arctic blizzards. The desert is barren for lack of rain; beyond the mountains, the over-productive jungle is saturated with tropical downpours. Along the shore thunder-storms are unknown; up on the icy tablelands of the cordillera, whose volcanoes are sealed with snow, lightning rips open the mountainsides. Fire splits, and water smooths. Mists are strong enough to magnify and the sky is clear enough to do so. The puna is a land of brutal elements, yet there is found the little chinchilla, protected with softest fur.

On the coast, overhead calm is counterbalanced by subterranean fury. “All geological phenomena are still in active operation,” the shore rising, earthquakes changing the face of the earth, and underground rivers dodging beneath a desert sterile for want of the water which they are hurrying off. The people who live in this country of volcanoes and earthquakes feed on red peppers.{5}

If lack of water prevents the heat of the sun from making the desert productive, so cold prevents water upon the mountain plains from encouraging vegetation. In the jungle luxuriance of all growth conceals any single benefit. Nature erects barriers everywhere. She has surrounded her richest gifts with almost insurmountable difficulties. Fertilizers come from the desert, a realm of death. Mines of the Andes coldly hoard their riches under a life-sucking atmosphere. Agassiz said: “An empire might esteem itself rich in any one of the sources of industry which abound in the Amazon valley.” But these are inaccessible from their very quantity, and they shut in beneath them a fever-laden air. Where there is most fertilizer, the land is most barren; where there are most precious metals, it is most incapable of supporting human life; where richest, it is most difficult to cultivate.

Such is Peru. Elements and forces contrast; each combats each, and all attack man. Nature wars against herself: tropic heat, arctic cold; heavy, poisonous jungle mists, thin air of the mountain-tops; scorching dryness, reeking wet.{6} Even obstacles contrast in Peru. Man is threatened everywhere by elements, by insects. He drowns here or dies of thirst there. He can even be overcome by cold or sunstroke in the same place.

Peru is a land of violent extremes. It has a range of mountains as great as any in the world. The towering peaks are too high to climb. Far above circles the condor, the largest bird in the world. Peru is the source of the world’s greatest river system, whose luxuriant forests are too thick to penetrate. The only representatives of a lost geological age inhabit them, as well as the biggest snakes and the smallest birds. Peru has great mineral deposits in the mountains; it also has rubber in the forests. Wool is produced on the frozen plains, and chocolate in the deep gorges lost among them. And from the valleys intersecting the desert come cotton and sugar-cane.

All kinds of obscure substances are found in this versatile country, ipecac and cochineal, cocaine and vanadium. Not unlike the rest of the world, chill here produces fever, but quinine, the best remedy for the disease of{7} contrast, comes also from the forests of Peru.

Although nature is a supreme fact, its natural history is not the whole of Peru. And contrast as a method of interpretation does not fail for its other aspects. Though man seems to play so small a part, he has lived here since antediluvian animals wandered among coal forests on the Andes. To the charm of limitless nature is added the mystery of great peoples destroyed before they were known. The riches of the Incas and of the glittering, vice-regal Spanish days, when continents were found, taken, and explored, contrast with present poverty. Consistently throughout, the riches of Peru have impoverished it. Its gifts have caused its ruin over and over again.

Wars and rebellions have riddled the country, and bull-fights have filled leisure hours. Though audacity of action has fascinated historians of Peru, its periods of peace have in them even more of romance: a nation of slaves ruled by a monarch-god; oriental splendor of Lima shining because of forced labor in the dark, suffocating mines; Arab blood in the con{8}querors’ veins penetrating the quiet Indian people, adding a keener edge to their sufferings. The poverty of the present-day Indians contrasts with lavish nature, “beggars sitting on a pile of gold.” Contrasts of nature, of people to country, of antiquity to the present—these diverse elements are insistent wherever one turns.

The charm of contrasting facts is puissant. Almost any one of them might be the text for an allegory. To guard against rhapsody, I have documented every statement made. Conservative authority can be given for every fact, however fantastic, however trivial. The few legends are in a sense also facts: “Une légende ment parfois moins qu’un document.”

The tellers of Peru’s story deserve a history themselves. First came the falcon-eyed missionaries of Spain, sword and rosary clattering beneath priestly robes, to subject the Indians to salvation, or mercifully to condemn them to death by torture. Had they been less conscientious in describing all those quaint beliefs and idolatrous practices which they came to stamp out, we should perhaps have missed the chief source of information in regard to the{9} Children of the Sun and their dependent peoples. Military writers and official chroniclers followed in close order. It took them some time to recover from their amazement at this land of “gold, silver and pleasant monkeys.” They wrote with convincing emphasis, “Wee that live now at Peru ... finde not ourselves to bee hanging in the aire, our heades downward and our feete on high.” On the contrary, they discovered that they were even “as near unto heaven at Peru as in Spain.”

Explorers and adventurers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were in the forefront of writers of romance. Such authors have always found inspiration here. From Marmontel to the Peruvian Tales of Guenelette, from Frank Stockton to José-Maria de Heredia, chiseler of faultless cameos, who himself came from a dramatic land of Spanish conquest, Peru has been a word to conjure with. But invention has added no glamour to history. It cannot keep pace with fact.

Accounts by various travelers of past centuries, voyages of discovery and reports of treasure fleets are followed by the students of to-day.{10} Scientists write of Peru, each authority finding his specialty accented. The geologist sees cosmic forces in active operation still. The anthropologist studies untouched savages in the morasses of the Amazon, the naturalist’s wonderland. Archeology now has an exciting preëminence. Cool authorities admit the amazing antiquity of Peruvian ruins. The historian finds a great barbaric civilization; the economist ancient systems of state policy; the prospector an extensive system of navigable waterways. The mining engineer discovers inexhaustible mines, and the agriculturist unique opportunity, where the uplands of a farm lie among snows, its lowlands under rubber groves and orange trees. All write of Peru, and an increasing bibliography affords easy access to every sort of statistics. I have referred to a wide range of authorities, many of them cited in an appendix, to supplement my own observations, made as member of an astronomical expedition, during a stay of several months in Peru.A painstaking person while in Peru wrote a journal containing all he saw. Not an event{11} or an observation escaped chronicle. But on reaching home he discovered that his really poignant memories were not in his journal. His entries, though conscientious, “were but the ingredients. They were not the secret of the philtre.”

Facts make their own appeal. But direct assault is not the only means of approach. Sometimes subtleties are best observed by looking at something else. It is often easier to see the beauty, the full glitter and glance of a thing in another object, as the play of colors in the aurora borealis is better perceived by turning the eyes aside. Sometimes one or two minor points chosen from an embarrassment of interesting details are all the imagination needs, as a plant selects only those elements from air and soil which can be used in perfecting its tissue of stem and leaf and flower.

It can only be hoped that this book about Peru may succeed in even suggesting its unique appeal.

PART I

IN THE DESERT
“I love all waste
And solitary places; where we taste
The pleasure of believing what we see
Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be;
And such was this wide ocean, and this shore
More barren than its billows.”
Shelley
{15}{14}
CHAPTER I

ALONG SHORE
The surface of the ocean is unruffled. Only the heaving of its great body suggests the power beneath. But when it confronts the desert cliffs, backed by the world-weight of the Andes, the force which has been gathering all the way from Australia, so mighty that it can be compared to nothing but itself, snarls into uncontrolled fury, rebellious, but acknowledging the limit of its power.

The “Peaceful Ocean” lies next to a land of geological unrest; the coast rising, subterranean torment breaking out in earthquakes, hurling cliffs into the sea. Even the busy modern port of Callao partakes of the mystery of this elemental land. The white ships anchored in the clear water of its harbor g
