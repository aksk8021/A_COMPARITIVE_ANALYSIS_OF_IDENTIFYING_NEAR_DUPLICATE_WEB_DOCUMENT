AKE a pan proportioned in size to the quantity of sugar you intend to clarify: to thirty pounds of sugar, put two gallons of water: whisk the white of an egg in the water, and set the pan on the fire; when the sugar begins to boil, add half a pint of water, to prevent its boiling over, and also to raise 14the scum. Having skimmed the sugar till there remains only a small white scum, totally different from the other, which is foul and black, take it off, and strain it into the pan in which you intend to keep it for use.

N.B. A particular attention to these rules, respecting the clarifying of sugar, will greatly conduce to the effect of the directions, which will be laid down hereafter.

To boil Sugar to the Degree called Smooth.
Having first clarified, put the quantity of sugar required into the preserving pan, and let it boil over the fire. You will ascertain its having boiled to the degree called smooth, by the following experiment: Dip your finger into the sugar; then put that finger and your thumb together. If in opening them you see a small thread drawn, which breaking immediately leaves a 15drop on the finger, you may conclude the sugar is boiled to the degree called smooth.

To boil Sugar to the Degree called Pearled.
This method of boiling sugar is thus ascertained: Take a little of the sugar when boiling, between your finger and thumb, and if on separation a string adheres to both, it is boiled to the degree called pearled.

To boil Sugar to the Degree called Blown.
Let the sugar boil longer than on the former occasion, and make the following experiment: Dip the skimmer into the sugar; take it out immediately; and if on blowing strongly through the holes of the skimmer, little bladders appear, the sugar is boiled to the degree called blown.

16
To boil Sugar to the Degree called Feathered.
This is a higher degree of boiling sugar than either of the former. It is proved thus: Having dipped the skimmer into the sugar, and shaken it over the pan, give it a sudden flirt behind you, when, if it flies from the skimmer in particles resembling feathers, it is boiled to this degree.

To boil Sugar to the Degree called Crackled.
This degree is ascertained in the following manner: The sugar having boiled somewhat longer than on the former process; dip a skewer into it, and immediately after into cold water; if on drawing the sugar from the skewer it snaps like glass, it is boiled to the degree called crackled.

To boil Sugar to the Degree called Carmelled.
This degree is thus ascertained: Having boiled the sugar longer still, 17dip a skewer into it, and immediately after into cold water. If the sugar be boiled to the degree called carmelled, it will snap the very instant it touches the cold water, and must be taken off directly, to prevent burning and discolouration.

PART II.
METHODS OF PRESERVING FRUITS &c.
To preserve Oranges or Lemons whole.
Having selected the largest and best coloured oranges, carve them, cut a round hole in each, where the stalk grew; put them into a pan of cold water, set them over the fire, and boil them till they become so soft that you may thrust a straw through them, shifting the water twice during the time of this boiling; then take them out, put 18them into cold water, and let them remain till they become cold; after which scoop out the cores with a spoon, put them again into cold water, and let them there remain forty-eight hours, shifting the water during that space four times: drain them when taken out, put them into the preserving pan, cover them with clarified sugar, and then let them simmer over a fire for about two hours: proceed in this manner for seven or eight days; then drain them from the sugar, and having prepared a fresh quantity boiled to the degree called pearled, put in the oranges, and having boiled them for the space of an hour, set them by for use in an earthen pan, or put them into glasses, and cover them with clarified sugar.

To preserve Cherries without Stones.
For a pound of cherries prepare a pound of sugar boiled to the degree called blown, into which put the cherries stoned, 19and having boiled them well, set them by till the next day. Having then strained the syrup, add some sugar and about three pints of currant juice to it, let it boil about half an hour, put in the cherries, boil all together, skim well, and afterwards set by for use.

To preserve Cherries with Stones.
Having selected the finest morello fruit, and pricked each cherry with a needle; put them into a thin clarified sugar, and let them simmer an hour, or more, cautiously avoiding their coming to a boil. Proceed thus for two or three days; then strain the sugar from them, and having added more sugar with some currant juice, after a gentle boil and being well skimmed, set them by for use.

To preserve White Pea Plums.
Select your plums before they are too ripe, slit each of them in the seam, scald 20them in clear water till they become tender, then put them into cold water, in which having remained a whole night, drain, put them into sugar boiled to the degree called pearled, and having simmered therein twice or thrice a day for two days, drain the syrup and boil it for an hour, adding to it about a quart of white currant juice. Then put in your plums, let all boil together, and when cold they will be fit for use.

To preserve yellow Plums commonly called yellow Margates.
Having made choice of your plums just before they become ripe, and prepared as much sugar to the degree called blown, as will handsomely cover them, put them in, and giving them a gentle boil, set them by till next day and give them another boil. The day following drain them, and having boiled the syrup to the degree called pearled, put in the 21plums, and let all boil together, when they will be fit for drying, or putting into pots.

N.B. You may scald and take the skins off the plums before you preserve them.

To preserve Damascenes.
Having pricked the intended quantity, put them into a preserving pan with as much sugar as will cover them; give them one good boil, take them off and let them stand a day; on the morrow, simmer them four or five times, and thus let them remain three or four days; then drain the syrup, and adding more sugar, boil it well, put in the damascenes, give all a good boil, skim well and set by for use.

To preserve Mogul, or large Egg Plums.
Having pricked your plums, put them into cold water with three or four 22handfulls of salt in it, and there letting them remain four days, scald them in clear water till they become tender; put them into a thin sugar, and give them a gentle boil. This done, put them by, and the next day let them simmer, and so proceed for five or six days, till you perceive the syrup becomes thick, when it will be proper to drain and add more sugar; boil till it is ropy, then you may put in your plums; give them a gentle boil and set by for use.

N.B. You must keep the plums under the syrup in your preserving pan by putting a piece of board over them.

To preserve whole Strawberries.
Prepare as much sugar as will cover the intended quantity to the degree called blown, into which put the strawberries; gently boil and set them by; the next day drain them and boil the syrup till it becomes ropy or pearled, 23then put in the strawberries, give them a gentle boil, skim them well, and put them into pots.

N.B. Rasberries are preserved in the same manner; but it is recommended to put some jelly drawn from gooseberries, or white currants, into the syrup.

To preserve Barberries in Bunches.
Having prepared a sufficient quantity of sugar to the degree called blown, put in the barberries tied in small bunches, let them boil well, then skim, and set them by for use.

To preserve Red Currants in Bunches.
Prepare as much sugar to the degree called pearled, as will cover them, into which put them, and give them a gentle boil: then next drain them, and adding a little more sugar, and some 24juice extracted from red currants, give the whole a good boil; skim them well, and they will be fit for use.

N.B. White currants are preserved in the same manner, adding only white currant juice to the syrup.

To preserve Green Gage Plums.
First prick your plums well with a needle, and having laid them in salt and water, for eight and forty hours, scald them in pump water till they become tender, after which put them in cold water, and there let them remain till they are cool; then drain and pack them in single layers in your preserving pan; and give them a gentle heat once a day, for three days; this done, drain them, add some more sugar boiled to the degree of what is called pearled; then put them in and give them a heat, but not so far as to boil: proceed in this manner for two or three days, till you perceive 25the syrup becomes thick, then drain them, strain the syrup, boil it to a good height, put in your plums, give the whole a gentle boil, set them by in pans, and they are ready for drying out or putting into jelly.

To preserve Green Orange Plums.
The manner is the same as that prescribed with respect to the green gages: but care must be taken to cover these plums with a paper every time they are heated, as an effectual means of keeping in the steam and preserving the green hue: the same method should be observed as to green fruit in general.

To preserve Apricots.
Having taken the stones out, and cut your fruit in halves, scald them till they are tender, and put them into cold water: then drain, put them into a thin sugar, give them a gentle heat and set them 26by: the next day, drain the syrup from them, let it boil well and afterwards put in the fruit: let the whole simmer well together; and thus proceed from day to day, till the apricots are duly prepared, which may be known from the consistence of the syrup.

N.B. The Roman apricot is the best to preserve, and the orange apricot the best for jam.

To preserve Green Apricots.
Take the fruit when you can thrust a pin through the stone: prick them, and scald them till they are tender; then having drained, and put them into a thin syrup, let them simmer for half an hour every day, for a week: this done, drain them, boil some sugar to the degree called blown, to which add the syrup, and boiling it well, put in the fruit; let all boil together and set by. The next day, drain it, boil the syrup 27higher, put in the fruit, and boil till you perceive the syrup hang like a thread from the skimmer: the fruit are then fit for drying, or putting in jelly.

N.B. Green almonds are preserved in the same manner; but they should be scalded in soft water to take the down off.

To preserve Green Gooseberries.
Let the gooseberries be gathered before they are ripe, and scalded till they become yellow: then put them into cold water, and having remained twelve hours, put them into a very thin sugar, and heat them gently over the fire, till you perceive they begin to be green; after which drain the syrup from them, and boil it to the degree called pearled: put in your fruit, and having boiled all together, set by. Proceed in this manner for two, or three days, and the gooseberries will be fit for use.

28
To preserve Angelica.
Take the angelica when young, split it into thin strips, and having scalded it till it becomes very tender, string it, put it into the preserving pan and cover it with sugar; in this state give it a gentle heat once a day, for four or five days, and when you perceive it become quite green, drain it and add some more sugar: having boiled it till it becomes ropy, put in your angelica and boil it up well; then put it by, and when it has lain in the syrup about five weeks, it will be fit to cand.

To preserve Apricot, or Peach Chips.
Pare the rind of the fruit into chips of the size of a shilling: to every pound of chips, allow a pound and a half of sugar, in which boil the chips; and having set them by for two days, drain them from the syrup, and boil it to the degree called blown; then put in the 29chips, let them boil well, and having set them by for a week, drain and wash them in cold water, and put them in sieves into the store, first sifting some sugar on them, and dry them well.

To preserve Figs.
Having pricked your figs through and through, put them into the preserving pan, cover them with sugar, give them a gentle boil, and set them by. The next day drain them, and having boiled the syrup, put in the figs and set them by for two days: then drain them, add more sugar to the syrup, and having boiled it to a high degree, put in the figs, and let the whole boil up well together; proceed in this manner every other day for a week, by which time the sugar will have penetrated into the fruit: then drain them, and boil the syrup till it ropes, or hangs in strings from the skimmer: put in the figs, boil well up, skim and set them by for use.

30
To preserve dried Cherries.
Stone the Kentish cherries, and put as much sugar into the preserving pan, as will cover them: having boiled the sugar till it cracks, put in the cherries, give them a good boil, skim, and set them by in an earthen pan till next day: then drain, and put them on sieves in a hot stove, and turn them; they will take three days drying, and when dry, will keep two or three years.

To preserve Peaches whole.
Take the Newington peaches before they are ripe, scald them till they are tender, put them into as much sugar as will cover them, give them a gentle boil, and set them by till the next day: then drain them from the syrup, which having boiled with an additional quantity of sugar to the degree called blown, put in the peaches, and after simmering set them by for a week; then drain the 31syrup from them, and boiling it higher than before, put in the peaches, and let all boil gently together for an hour, by which time, if you find the sugar has penetrated the fruit, you may skim and set them by for use.

To preserve Pine Apple Chips.
Having taken off the outside of the pine apple; cut it cross-ways into thin slices, which put in layers into an earthen pan, sifting sugar over each layer, let all stand for about ten days, in which time, if melted, put it together into a preserving pan, and boil it up twice a day for three days, and set them by for drying.

To preserve Pine Apples whole.
Take the pine apple just before it becomes ripe, let the top remain on it. Having perforated it with a penknife, scald it till it becomes so tender, that a straw may be thrust through it. Let 32it then remain in cold water two hours, and in that state be put into a jar, with sugar strewed over it, boiled to the degree called smooth, and covered close down: the next day drain the syrup and boil it up, and in this manner proceed every day, till the water is extracted from the pine. As the syrup by that means will be rendered thin, you will add more sugar and boil it up to a high degree, and set the pine by for a fortnight, when if you perceive the syrup is thick, you may depend upon it the pine is properly preserved, and therefore may take it out of that syrup and put it into a clarified syrup in a glass, in which it will keep good seven years, if unaffected by damp or wet.

To preserve Medlars.
Having scalded the fruit till the skins are easily taken off; stone them at the head, cover them with sugar, give them 33a gentle boil, and let them stand for two days: then drain them, and boiling the syrup till it becomes ropy, put in the medlars, let all boil up gently, and set by for use.

To preserve Pears.
Prick the pears through in six places, scald them till they are tender, cut the rind smoothly off, put them into cold water with some allum in it to keep them white, and having remained in that state three hours, shift them into a thin sugar, and give them a gentle heat every day for three or four days; then drain them; and having added some sugar to the syrup, and boiled it to the degree called pearled, put in the pears, and boil all up together: proceed in this manner, till the syrup becomes thick, then colour some of the pears red, and set them by.

To preserve Green Leaves.
Take grape leaves, strawberry leaves, or any other leaves: let them remain 34four hours in cold spring water, then take them out and put them into some sugar, give them a gentle boil, take them off, and set them by for use.

N.B. They are convenient for putting under fruit in plates.

To preserve Green Grapes.
Having selected the largest and best grapes before ripe, cut a small slit in each, and scald them; after remaining two days in the water they are scalded in, drain, put them into a thin sugar; give them a heat over a slow fire, and thus proceed for three days: then drain them, and adding to the syrup some sugar, boiled to the highest degree of what is called blown, put in the grapes, and let all boil up together; skim well, and set them by for use.

35
To preserve Wine Sour Plums.
These plums are the best species for preserving, on account of their tartness, and should be treated in the same manner as damascenes, only they will require from their size a longer time in preparation.

To preserve Green Limes.
Having scalded the limes till they are tender, and taken out the cores, put them into a thin sugar, and give them a gentle boil: then set them by and give them a gentle heat three times for three days, by which time they will become as green as grass: having boiled the syrup till it become ropy, put in the limes, boil up all together, and the fruit will be fit for use.

N.B. Green walnuts, or jerkins, may be treated in the same manner as limes; and quinces in halves and quarters, in the same manner as pears; as there are 36several species of plums, and pears, that will not preserve, we recommend the following experiments: put a few plums into a little clarified sugar, and give them a heat over a gentle fire: if they seem to melt in the sugar they will not preserve, if they remain firm they certainly will, provided you adhere to the rules laid down.
