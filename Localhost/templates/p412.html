All things considered, you cannot help sympathising a little with Germany's outcry against the deceptive character of the British Empire. When an eminent physician has carefully diagnosed a patient's complaint and pronounced, quite emphatically, that he cannot possibly survive for more than a very brief period, it is up to that patient to fade away within the time limit prescribed for him. Otherwise, he must not expect his doctor to be pleased, or to express any but uncomplimentary opinions concerning his behaviour and the general defects of his system. Well, as everybody knows, Treitschke, Bernhardi, and other accomplished German professors devoted many years of their valuable lives to feeling the pulse of John Bull, and they found that, by all the known laws of science, he was on his last legs. They assured the world {6}at large, with the portentous cocksureness so peculiarly German, that he was so far gone that a properly administered shock was certain to bring about his immediate dissolution. The shock was administered all right; Germany saw to that; but instead of keeping to his part of the programme and dying, John promptly woke up, got out of bed, developed a lot more legs than anybody had credited him with, and has ever since been firmly standing on them all.

And Germany is naturally indignant at this. What is the use of scientific laws if they can thus be disregarded with impunity? Bernhardi praised the British for some things, but he was sure he knew what he was talking about, and most of the things they had done were much too foolish to obtain his approbation. He explained how we had neglected to train up our Colonies in the way they should go; we had never sternly imposed our own kultur on any of our "subject peoples"; we exercised no control over Australasia, Canada, South Africa: we had failed to hold them in subjection, and they were rapidly losing all trace of the British spirit and would not remain permanently within the Empire. Moreover, India and Egypt were seething with disaffection, he said, and if a beneficent Germany only gave them half a chance they would break into open revolt and throw off the hated British yoke. He had studied the whole position most thoroughly and foresaw hopeful possibilities of great Colonial rebellions–Australasia, Canada, South Africa would decide before long to become independent States, and the old country would have to go out and fight them in order to reduce them to submission, and then would come Germany's golden opportunity. But it might not be necessary to wait for those rebellions. If ever England were involved in a big war nearer home, the shrewd Bernhardi was quite convinced that the self-governing Colonies would naturally consult their own interests and decline to take any part in it. He laid it down emphatically that, at all events (to quote from Mr. Allen H. Powles's translation of his "Germany and the Next War"), "the Colonies can be completely ignored so far as concerns any European theatre of war."

All which indicates what a strange gulf there must be between the fossilised Prussian mind and the mind of a modern civilisation. These pretentious speculations looked so profound, and were actually so shallow; yet, simply by taking themselves seriously, the German professors and militarists bluffed most of the world into {7}accepting them as masterly students of psychology. There is something amusing in the essentially Prussian idea that we were ignorant of the art of Empire-building because we had not held our Colonies firmly in subjection and forced our own kultur upon our "subject peoples" and thus have made them indissolubly one with us. We have not done so for two reasons. For one, they would never have allowed us to do it; the men of British blood are not so docile as that, thank heaven! And for another, as a nation we have no such stupid, swaggering desire to lord it over our fellows. We had once, but have outgrown it. As for sending our armies out to make war on the great free Colonies if they resolved to set up as independent States–they are independent already, and if ever they decided to sever the formal, natural tie that links them easily with ourselves in a federated Empire, no Government in Great Britain would be so foolish as to do anything but reluctantly acquiesce in their decision.

Britain fought her sons of yore–
Britain failed; and nevermore,
Careless of our growing kin,
Shall we sin our fathers' sin.
The fact is, and it is now revealing itself, Germany does not understand what freedom means. She does not know the difference between slavery and brotherhood, and, with all her owlish wisdom, has never realised that love is a mightier bond than fear. She has learnt nothing from her failures in Poland, in Alsace, in her own Colonies. So immature is her conception of Empire that she took it as a sign of weakness in us when, after spending blood and treasure in the South African War, we withdrew and left the Boers and our own people living there to join hands and make their own laws and govern themselves. "The low-Dutch are in the ascendant in South Africa now," wrote the egregious Bernhardi, and he pronounced that when Germany launched her legions against England the South Africans would be quick to seize the occasion and rise and strike for freedom.

But people do not strike to obtain what they possess. The long-premeditated blow has fallen, and instead of shattering the British Empire past repair has merely tightened any loose rivets in it and welded it more firmly together than ever. German psychology has proved a vain thing; not a single one of the solemn prophecies of her professors has come true. South Africa has {8}crushed the enemy at her gates, has added German West Africa to the Empire, and is sending troops over to fight in the British battle-line in France. The Princes of India have rallied eagerly to the flag, and France and the Dardanelles have undying stories to tell of the loyalty and courage of those sons of hers who have fought and died for its honour. The moment the word of alarm flashed over the seas, Canada, Australia, New Zealand leaped to arms and were ready, and sent their thousands forth and are sending them still to hold inviolate the Empire that is theirs no less than ours.

But this is to be the story of the boys from Down Under; the equally glorious stories of Canada, South Africa, India I leave to other tellers.

In those August days of 1914 when war and peace were still in the balance, and we of the British Isles were waiting in tensest anxiety, not fearing that war was to come, but dreading lest the diplomatists should arrive at a compromise that would justify us in standing meanly aside and leaving France to her fate; all through Australia and New Zealand men waited as anxiously, torn with the self-same fear. And on the morning of the 5th, when the cable told them that Great Britain had declared war upon Germany they felt the same deep sense of relief that the same news had brought to us at midnight on the 4th–relief, and even thankfulness that, with Belgium's neutrality ruthlessly broken, the Empire had done the only right and honourable thing. When the storm burst, the Federal Parliament of Australia had been dissolved and electioneering was in full swing. Nevertheless, in two days, with the whole-hearted approval of all parties in the country, the Prime Minister had offered to send 20,000 men to the front, as a first contingent, and our Government had gladly accepted the offer. The Australian Commissioner in London called at the War Office in connection with this proposal, and wrote home to say that Lord Kitchener told him, "I know the Australian soldier, and know he will give a good account of himself"; and that his final words were, "Roll up! Roll up!"

And no sooner was the call made for volunteers for foreign service than they did roll up–they went swarming in thousands to the recruiting stations at Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Perth, and other great centres, and in a very short time more than the required number had been enrolled and were rapidly gathered into vast camps at Broadmeadows, at Helena Vale, {9}and elsewhere, and all the States of the Commonwealth were humming with warlike preparations. The militia were called out; Rifle Clubs were formed; the women organised for Red Cross work and to look after the needs of the soldiers and their families; troops slept by their guns in the forts round the coast, for German cruisers were prowling then in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean and there were possibilities of raids and bombardments. Negotiations were opened with the Imperial Government, which readily granted a War Loan of £18,000,000. There was prompt seizure of German and Austrian ships lying in Australian ports; there was a drastic hunting down of German spies and rounding up of alien enemies. Word that war had been declared was received on the morning of the 5th August, and at noon of the same day Australia's first shot was fired from the fort at Point Nepean, when a German cargo steamer, the Pfatz, was held up and captured. The first expeditionary force was raised within two or three days; and before the end of August a second large contingent had been formed and had gone into camp for training, this second contingent including a Light Horse Brigade; and "the Australian Light Horse," as Lord Denman, sometime Governor-General of the Commonwealth, has said, "is the finest Light Horse in the world."

A goodly percentage of these volunteer armies–for the compulsory service in Australia and New Zealand is for home defence only–were bushmen, farm-hands, clerks, miners, many of whom had thrown up lucrative appointments and journeyed long distances, hot-foot to be in time. A writer in The Melbourne Age spent an hour at one of the depots in Melbourne and gave the following list of the recruits who presented themselves whilst he was there: "jeweller–1; cricketer–1; actor–1; collar-maker–1; musicians–3; hairdressers–3; cooks–7; journalists–5; teachers–8; draper's assistant, 'private means,' hotel porter, military officer, chemist, wool classer, tailor, axeman, rubber planter, investor, insurance agent, signwriter, and student–1 each. There were two or three storekeepers, ten motor mechanics, and half a dozen travellers. This list," the reporter continues, "is a typical one, though of course in some States particular occupations would be differently represented. Generally speaking, it would be correct to say that at least 80 per cent. of the men–eight in every ten–have in some way earned their livings with their hands. The remaining 20 per cent. would be made up of clerks, accountants, shopkeepers, professional men, and others who were {10}not manual labourers. In the great field entered for the greatest of all races, 'private means' shows up rather badly."

But we must not forget that "private means" represents the smallest section of the community. What is infinitely more significant is that before the end of November 1914 more than the 20,000 men offered had been raised, had finished their preliminary training and sailed for Egypt; and a second force of 16,500 was then in training to follow them. There was also a force of some 7,000 mobilised for home defence. Something of what Australia was doing, of the ardour and spirit and spontaneous patriotism that animated her people may be gathered from a communication which Sir Charles Lucas made to The Times. Sir Charles, who used to be head of the Dominions Department of the Colonial Office, was on a visit to Australia in those early days of the war, and what impressed him greatly was the prevailing common sense and patriotic enthusiasm with which public bodies and private citizens worked, the promptitude and swiftness with which they prepared themselves, as if the war had been at their very doors instead of thousands of miles away. He saw no violent anti-German outbreak; no bombast nor boastfulness; nothing but a sober, willing, resolute desire to participate to the utmost in the great fight for freedom that was not to be the motherland's only, but the Empire's. "Political parties, the churches, and all classes spoke with one voice," says Sir Charles. "War funds seemed to be almost unduly multiplied; young men everywhere were eager to go to the front, and all were making sacrifices in time, and money, and work"; and he expresses the keenest admiration of the men he saw at the military camps, and the zeal, cheerfulness, and efficiency with which all ranks were fitting themselves for the task to which they had put their hands. "Australia will support the cause of the Empire in this war to the last man and the last shilling"–Mr. Fisher knew the hearts of his people before he drew that limitless bill upon their loyalty, and this is the glorious story of how they are meeting it.

As it was in Australia, so it was in New Zealand. There was the same intense suspense in those first days of August 1914, the same nameless fear lest the old country should be lulled into accepting German pledges or otherwise induced to remain neutral and leave France to her fate, the same fierce indignation against the unprovoked attack upon Belgium, and the same immeasurable sense of relief and thankfulness when the word came that Britain had {11}declared war. There was, too, the same spontaneous uprising, the same sinking of party differences, the same swift, passionate gathering up of all the energies, all the resources of the nation and placing them at the service of the Empire–not with any lust for glory or conquest, but with a high realisation that in so doing New Zealand was devoting herself also to the higher service of humanity. For, as you may hear on all hands, it was the terrible story of Belgium's martyrdom that stirred such a passion of sympathy and blazing wrath throughout New Zealand as in Australia–the thought of that gallant little people so brutally wronged and battling with such desperate heroism to drive back the barbaric hordes of a mighty invader: it was this that so tore at the hearts of people there that they rejoiced, as at the best of good tidings, when Britain took up the cause of the weak and the wronged and gave them the chance to fight, and if need be die beside her in so just a cause. No tocsin sounded in any dark hour of attack ever called forth such myriads and such more than willing myriads of defenders as have rallied from all quarters of the earth to the cry that went up from those violated homes of Belgium. Australia and New Zealand in generous rivalry made haste to subscribe funds for the relief of the Belgian refugees, and to send them shipments of food, blankets, and clothing. Meanwhile, military preparations went forward in New Zealand with amazing rapidity. An expeditionary force of 10,000 was raised, and by the time they were ready to sail for Egypt a further 3,000 were training in camp at Wellington, recruits were offering themselves in undiminishing numbers, and arrangements were made to send out reinforcements of at least 3,000 every two months–a figure which has since been largely increased. There was a demand that the age limit should be raised to fifty, such multitudes of older men were keen to go on active service; but as this was not done, they organised themselves, as our older men have done in the homeland and in every one of the British dominions, into Citizen Armies for home defence. In less than three weeks Christchurch alone had enrolled an army of this sort 1,200 strong, made up, like the New Zealand army for the field, and like all the new British armies, of men drawn from all classes of the community. The Premier, and other leading men of the nation, declared in unqualified terms that New Zealand was ready to give her all, and to shrink from no sacrifice for the honour and the integrity of the Empire, and she has ever since been fulfilling that pledge to the utmost.

{12}One has read many such stories as that of the college professor who threw up his appointment at Dunedin in order to enlist as a private; and as that of the prosperous farmer miles away across the lonely plains of South Island, who had heard nothing of any crisis until news burst upon him that war had been declared two days ago, then, fearing he might be too late, left his farm to the care of his wife and whoever could be got to look after it, hurried by horse and rail to Canterbury, took a few years off his age, and got into the first expeditionary force. And one could tell numerous similar stories of the Australians. There is that record of Cormick, the young Queensland grazier, who, immediately the call reached him, rode 460 miles to the nearest station at Hergott Springs, then travelled 450 miles by rail to Adelaide, only to find that the Light Horse regiment there had made up its full number. He telegraphed to Tasmania, but the Light Horse section there had no opening for him. He had made up his mind to go, however, and, though he must have spent more than a year's pay in journeying from place to place on his quest, he succeeded at last and sailed with the first overseas contingent.

But better than I can hope to express it you find the high, indomitable soul of Australasia revealing itself in two letters from which I will make some short extracts. One is written by Mr. Edward Grimwade, who went out and settled in New Zealand some years ago, to his brother, Mr. L. L. Grimwade, of Stoke-on-Trent, in England. "My boy, Len, went away with his regiment yesterday," writes Mr. Grimwade. "All we can say is 'The Lord bless the lad.'... On this subject his mother is in liquidation, and his dad not much better. None the less, if the Motherland calls, Ted must go too.... I am prepared to give another son (as I have given one) and I am prepared to get into the fighting line myself. Further, I am prepared to suffer loss of fortune and see starvation, rather than sacrifice the honour of our Empire."

And here is a letter written in these later days which will serve to show the splendid spirit that lives in Australia's volunteers. It was written by Second Lieutenant Meager, of the 3rd Australian Infantry. He took part in that daring and triumphant landing at Gallipoli, and was promoted from the ranks for bravery. Later, he was killed in action, leaving a widow and child in Australia, and this last letter from him was received by his mother on the same day as the announcement of his death reached her:

"During the next few days we shall be facing death every {13}minute. If I am taken off, do as the Roman matrons of old–keep your tears for privacy, steel your heart, and get a dozen recruits to fill my place. Pray hard for me, and if God wills it, I shall see it through. I shall go into action with a clean heart, and if I emerge safely I hope I shall have proved myself a man and a leader, and thereby have justified the confidence of my commanders."

This is the stuff of which our Australasian brothers are made; these are the men upon whose degeneracy or disloyalty Treitschke, Bernhardi, and that pitiful brood of Prussian wiseacres relied. Never was any royal utterance more profoundly significant or more simply true than the message that King George sent to his Overseas Dominions at the end of the first month of the war:

"During the past few weeks the peoples of my whole Empire at home and overseas have moved with one mind and purpose to confront and overthrow an unparalleled assault upon the continuity of civilisation and the peace of mankind. The calamitous conflict is not of my seeking. My voice has been cast throughout on the side of peace. My Ministers earnestly strove to allay the causes of strife and appease differences with which my Empire was not concerned. Had I stood aside when in defiance of pledges to which my Kingdom was a party the soil of Belgium was violated and her cities laid desolate, when the very life of the French nation was threatened with extinction, I should have sacrificed my honour and given to destruction the liberties of my Empire and of mankind. I rejoice that every part of the Empire is with me in this decision.

"My peoples in the Self-Governing Dominions have shown beyond all doubt that they whole-heartedly endorse the grave decision which it was necessary to take. My personal knowledge of the loyalty and devotion of my Oversea Dominions had led me to expect that they would cheerfully make the great efforts and bear the great sacrifices which the present conflict entails. The full measure in which they have placed their services and resources at my disposal fills me with gratitude, and I am proud to be able to show to the world that my people overseas are as determined as the people of the United Kingdom to prosecute a just cause to a successful end.

"The Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Dominion of New Zealand have placed at my disposal their naval forces, which have already rendered good service to the {14}Empire. Strong Expeditionary Forces are being prepared in Canada, in Australia, and in New Zealand for service at the front, and the Union of South Africa has released all British troops and has undertaken important military responsibilities, the discharge of which will be of the utmost value to the Empire. Newfoundland has doubled the numbers of its branch of the Royal Naval Reserve, and is sending a body of men to take part in the operations at the front.... All parts of my Oversea Dominions have thus demonstrated in the most unmistakable manner the fundamental unity of the Empire amidst all its diversity of situation and circumstance."

WITH OUR COLONIAL TROOPS IN EGYPT.

CHAPTER II
PATROLLING THE PACIFIC
We can hold our own–
'Gainst us in vain all envious shafts are hurled
If still we be
The Sons of Freedom, 'neath one flag unfurled,
Co-heirs of Fame and Wardens of the Sea,
One tongue, one race, one heart before the world.
George Essex Evans.
Whilst the new armies were still training, the fleet of Australia put to sea, joined the New Zealand fleet, and together they proceeded to co-operate with the British naval forces in sweeping the Pacific for German merchantmen, and hunting down the few elusive German cruisers that were prowling the seas thereabouts in search of prey. Three of these cruisers in particular, the Gneisenau, the Scharnhorst, and the Emden, were dodging all pursuit, successfully capturing and sinking British and French trading and passenger ships, and bombarding the coast towns of some of our South Sea Islands; and the Emden, before it could be rounded up and destroyed, had gone as far afield as India and shelled Madras. "The German cruisers are playing a game of hide-and-seek on the broad expanse of the Pacific," an Australian naval officer wrote home, "and are avoiding a trial of strength with the vessels of the Australian fleet. We have been looking for them ever since war was declared, and are more than anxious to have a go at them, but they keep out of the way. The task of definitely locating them and getting to grips is an enormous one. The Pacific is so wide, and there are so many thousands of islets that we could pass within five minutes of them and yet fail to be aware of their presence. Once they are cornered, it will be a fine fight–a fight to a finish.... Once we thought we had the German boats bottled up in Simpson Haven. Orders were issued to the destroyers to ferret them out, and in the dead of night the three little boats, with all lights out and crews at their stations, crept into the harbour, which might have been mined. However, after sweeping round the bay {18}we found our quarry was not there. We landed a small party which smashed up the telegraphic instruments, then dashed out again."

So for some weeks the warships of Australia and New Zealand were alertly at work, chasing the nimble Germans in and out among those thousand islands of the South Seas. British and French and Japanese vessels took up the difficult hunt with them, but in that vast wilderness of waters, with such innumerable creeks and bays and obscure hiding-places to skulk in, it was far easier to lose the wily enemy than to find him. In due course, however, the Gneisenau and the Scharnhorst were cornered and accounted for; but the Emden remained at large and ran a long and brilliantly triumphant career before it was trapped and beaten at last in a desperate fight with the Australian battle cruiser, the Sydney.

Meanwhile, on the 30th August, 1914, the island of Samoa was captured without opposition by the combined fleets of Australasia, Britain, and France, under the command of Rear-Admiral Patey. When the fleets arrived off the island, the Admiral sent an officer ashore with a letter to the Acting Governor, Herr S. N. Rimburg, saying:

"I have the honour to inform you that I am off the port of Apia with an overwhelming force, and in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, I will not open fire if you surrender immediately. I therefore summon you to surrender to me forthwith the town of Apia and the Imperial possessions under your control. An answer must be delivered within half an hour to the bearer."

To some of us now there seems a touch of unconscious humour in Herr Rimburg's reply, when we remember how the ships of his own nation bombarded unfortified English towns without giving them any preliminary warning at all, for this is the letter that Admiral Patey's messenger brought back:

"According to the principles of the rights of nations, especially of the agreements of the second Hague Peace Conference, the bombardment of our harbours and protectorates is forbidden, as is the threat to do so. I therefore respectfully protest against your Excellency's proposal. But to avoid the military measures you propose, I have given orders for the wireless telegraph station to be demolished and that no resistance shall be offered."

It always went against the grain with many Britishers that the last home of Stevenson, the island that has his grave on one of its hill-tops, should ever have been ceded to the Germans, and the {19}news that it had been recovered from them was an occasion for enthusiastic rejoicing on that sentimental ground, as well as because it meant that a valuable colony had been added to the Empire. One very pleasant circumstance in connection with this bloodless victory was that the French and British residents in the Samoan Islands bore testimony to the kindness with which they had been treated by the German authorities and spontaneously petitioned the conquerors to show special consideration to the German ex-Governor and his officials, and the request was met at once in the friendliest possible spirit. It almost seemed as if the gracious, humane influence of Tusitala were still potent in the very atmosphere of the place. Colonel Robert Logan, the new British Administrator of Samoa, took up residence with his staff at Stevenson's own house "Vailima," which had been occupied by the German Governor, Dr. Schultz, and says in his report:

"I conferred with the German heads of departments and their subordinates, and, as they have given their parole to do nothing inimical to British interests and to carry out their duties loyally, I have retained them, with two exceptions, in their respective offices at the same salaries as they were previously receiving."

Equally pleasant, too, in connection with the capture of Samoa, were certain details mentioned concerning the appointment of Mr. Williams to the post of Deputy-Administrator of the island of Savali. "Mr. Williams has been in the islands for over forty years," wrote Colonel Logan, "and from the inception of German rule in Samoa until the declaration of war acted in the capacity of Deputy Administrator of Savali, under the German Government. On the declaration of war he was given the option of resigning his British citizenship or being relieved of his office, and he chose the latter alternative, although this entailed the loss of his pension."

The transfer of Samoa being arranged in this humane, reasonable fashion, the allied fleets departed to continue their other business, leaving a garrison of some 2,000 New Zealand troops at Apia in charge of the islands. A fortnight later those roving ships of the German Pacific squadron came round that way and shelled Apia, and were energetically shelled in return; but the firing did not last long; there was no attempt at a landing, very little damage was done, and ever since the New Zealanders have remained in peaceable possession of their first trophy.

In the interval, on the 11th September, at 7 in the morning, the Australian squadron occupied Herbertshohe, the principal {20}town in the island of New Pomerania, which is the largest island of the Bismarck Archipelago. It was discovered by Captain Cook, who named it New Britain, but the British Government never formally took possession of it, and in 1884 Germany seized and rechristened it, and at the same time annexed half of the neighbouring island of New Guinea and changed its name to Kaiser Wilhelmsland. The remainder of New Guinea had long been shared betwixt the Dutch and the British, and there was profound dissatisfaction in Australia when the Germans were thus allowed to steal a march on us. There was already a feeling abroad that they were hankering after world-dominion and were dangerous neighbours. This uneasiness had been lulled by the passing of years, but the aggressive boastfulness of Germany and the outbreak of the war had naturally revived it and sharpened it to more than its first acuteness, and the knowledge that this menace to her peace had been finally removed was received throughout Australia with a lively satisfaction that was echoed from every quarter of the Empire.

On that morning of the 11th September a party of fifty men of the Australian Naval Reserve, under the command of Commander J. A. H. Beresford, and accompanied by Lieutenant-Commander Elwell and Lieutenant Bowen, landed at Herbertshohe. There was a small group of Germans gathered on the wharf, and these, being hailed, replied that no opposition would be offered. As soon as the landing party had fallen in on the beach they set out to march through the forest to the wireless station, which was about six miles inland, and luckily, in spite of the Germans' assurance that they would meet with no resistance, Commander Beresford was on the alert against treachery, had thrown out scouts, and was prepared for any surprise attack that might be attempted. There was no sign or sound of an enemy for a while, but when they had gone some two miles into the forest the invaders suddenly realised that they had walked into a trap. A volley fired from the bush and dense tropical undergrowth which shut the road in on either side took them unawares. A German force had entrenched themselves close ahead athwart the road, and a number of blacks, hidden among the trees on both sides, started and kept up a harassing enfilade. But the Australians took the half-expected surprise with the most perfect sangfroid. They energetically returned the enemy's fire with a raking volley or two, then hurled themselves on the trenches, and, after a furious hand-to-hand struggle, carried them at the point of the bayonet. They captured several prisoners, and leaving these in a hut under a small guard the rest of the party pushed on resolutely, taking what cover was possible by the way and maintaining a continuous fight with snipers who kept pace with them, lurking in the depths of the forest. The advance was necessarily slow, for, in addition to the death that momentarily threatened them from among the trees, the road was mined in many places, and nothing but the utmost caution and coolness saved the indomitable little army from annihilation. As it was, they suffered heavy losses.
