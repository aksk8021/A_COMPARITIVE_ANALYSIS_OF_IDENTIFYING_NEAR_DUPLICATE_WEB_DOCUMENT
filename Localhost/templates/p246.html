In a pretty little village situated on the frontier of Austria, fifteen leagues from Vienna, there lived, more than a hundred years ago, a poor wheelwright named Mathias Haydn. This brave man was not rich; but his desires were so limited that he found himself happy with the little he possessed. All year round he had the maintenance of his neighbours' carts and big cars. These poor people, as poor as he, rarely paid him in cash, but they provided for his needs by gifts in kind as the price of his work. Only once in the year did Father Haydn have the opportunity to earn a few florins: it was when the Count of Harrach, lord of the village, was preparing to return to Vienna at the onset of winter; he then had his travel car repaired,wheelwrighting workshop . Very often he searched with difficulty, and without being able to discover it, which was the defective part of the car which needed repair. It is that the Count of Harrach knew the poverty of our wheelwright, and that, owing him protection as his vassal, he did not wish to humiliate him and always seemed to give him as the price of his work the annual relief which brought a little ease in the household. Some years ago the wheelwright had married a cook of the count; this one had left the service at the time of her marriage, but had not forgotten the kindness of her former master.

When Father Mathias had received from the steward the small sum he thought he had earned, there was a great celebration in the house and I would almost say in the village. Lets go! we are now rich; Sunday, big concert, exclaimed Father Mathias, and the first deduction he made from his savings was to go to the neighboring town to buy the harp strings which his favorite instrument had been missing for some time.

We French people find it hard to imagine a little wheelwright from an obscure village, cultivating the instrument of Labarre and Boscha; for anyone familiar with German customs, there is nothing surprising in this.

On Sundays, after the offices, which he had attended in his capacity as sexton of the parish, Father Mathias sat down in front of his door, and to the great satisfaction of his neighbors, he played on his harp all the pieces he knew. , and whose number was unfortunately a little restricted, because he had hardly the means to buy new music. He would even have found himself very embarrassed had it not been for the complaisance of one of his cousins, Frank, a schoolmaster at Naimbourg. This cousin lent him some pieces of music. He hastened to copy them, and adjusted them skilfully enough for his instrument. His wife had a rather pretty voice; he himself possessed a pleasant tenor voice, and often they performed national melodies, which their musical instinct, so natural to the people of their country, had them immediately arrange for two voices, with a good disposition of harmony. It was very rare that there was not, in the crowd gathered to hear them, an amateur to improvise a bass on these two parts, and the trio was complete.

One day when they were busy with music, our wheelwright was surprised to see his little Joseph, barely three years old, come gravely to stand beside him, armed with two small pieces of wood picked up among the shavings of his father, and which his childhood imagination represented to him as a perfect imitation of a violin and its bow. The father did not at first pay too much attention to this childish antics; but scarcely had he played a few bars than he could not help laughing at the coolness and imperturbable assurance of little Joseph. Indeed, the child, rubbing with the seriousness of a choirmaster, his two boards against each other, as if he were in reality holding an instrument, perfectly indicated the measurement, of the head and the foot. He does the father needed no more to recognize the child's disposition for music; and, from that moment, he applied himself to cultivating this natural taste. Little Joseph's progress was rapid: there were no games or amusements that interested him so much as his music lessons; at the end of a year, he read his part of song with open book; the following year his father had bought him a small harp, and the family concert had been augmented by a new performer, playing his part with perfect precision and regularity. interesting as much as his music lessons; at the end of a year, he read his part of song with open book; the following year his father had bought him a small harp, and the family concert had been augmented by a new performer, playing his part with perfect precision and regularity. interesting as much as his music lessons; at the end of a year, he read his part of song with open book; the following year his father had bought him a small harp, and the family concert had been augmented by a new performer, playing his part with perfect precision and regularity.

Little Joseph had grown up; he was eight years old, and his father having never stopped making him work on music, his natural taste for this art had become a passion. The exercises of his age had no attraction for him; his cousin Frank had given him a violin as a present, and, without a master, the child had guessed the mechanism of this instrument, on which he played all sorts of tunes, often improvising a part in uniforms, while his voice mingled with those of his father and mother.

One Sunday, a post chaise stops at the entrance to the village, a stranger gets out of it; he asks a wheelwright to visit his car. They take him to the home of Father Mathias. It was office time. Little Joseph was home alone. He asks the stranger to wait for the return of his father, who cannot be long in returning, and the conversation begins between the child and the traveler. “Whose harp is this? said the latter with surprise.

"It's Papa's," said the child.

"And what does he do with it?" picks up the stranger.

-How? 'Or' What! what he does with it? replies the child: what country do you come from to ignore what is done with a harp? Here, I'll show it to you. And he goes to take his little harp, which his host had not yet seen, and begins to play his entire repertoire.

"But that's very good!" said the stranger, more and more surprised.

"Do you also know how to read music?" and, while saying these words, he had drawn a roll of ruled paper from his pocket.

-What's this? said the child. Oh! it is a mass in music. Let's see, what part do you want me to sing for you?

-Oh! the one you want or rather the one you will be able to decipher.

—I can decipher them all, and even play them on my violin, here, listen instead.

—And the child executes the part of first above without making a mistake. The stranger draws him between his knees:

—Hey! he said to him, who showed you all this?

“It's dad.

"So your father is a musician?" so he is not a wheelwright?

"Why then?" answers the child; isn't it allowed to be a wheelwright and a musician? but I'll only be a musician, I don't want to be a wheelwright, that wastes too much time.

"Do you want to come with me to Vienna?" said the stranger, charmed by the liveliness of little Joseph's repartee.

—No, replies the child, daddy wouldn't be able to give me my music lessons anymore.

-Oh! Never mind, I'll take you to a place where you'll make music all day; you will receive lessons in violin, harpsichord, singing, Latin, whatever you want. You will have a beautiful red dress on Sunday, and you will sing at the church of Saint-Stéphan.

-Oh! so, I don't mind, resumes the child with joy, let's leave at once.

"One moment," said the stranger, "your father must at least agree to part with you." The child blushes, he lowers his head, his eyes fill with tears.

-How? 'Or' What! he said trembling, won't you take mum and dad too?

"With the best will in the world, it's impossible," replies the stranger, laughing. You understand, my little friend, that I cannot have your father and your mother receive the master's degree as altar boys.

Little Joseph then begins to burst into tears; he can't get used to the idea of ​​being separated from his father and his mother. But the stranger reassures him little by little, he gives him a glimpse of such a cheerful prospect, a future so filled with music (and this word is the equivalent of happiness for the child), that soon his tears stop flowing, he only dreams of the pleasure of the journey, and he had his little hands around the stranger's neck and was kissing him tenderly when Father Mathias returned, accompanied by his wife.

-Dad! dad! cried little Joseph, seeing him, please let me go to Vienna; here is a gentleman who is going to take me with him. The father understands nothing of this exclamation, but the stranger gets up:

“Monsieur,” he said to the wheelwright, “my name is Reutter, I am chapel master of the church of Saint-Stéphan de Vienne; chance has made me acquainted with the brilliant dispositions of your little fellow. If you agree, I will have him admitted to the master's degree where he will receive a good education, and in particular I will take all my care to give him a distinguished talent.

Such a proposal could only be agreeable to Father Mathias. He saw with sorrow the moment coming when he would be forced to teach his son a trade, not having the means to give him an education; he thanked the stranger and consented to everything. But turning around, he saw his wife crying at the announcement of the departure of her beloved son.

—What! my good Marie, he said to her in a tone of gentle reproach, are you so unreasonable to grieve over what should make our poor little Joseph happy? What will become of him if he stays with us? A poor wheelwright like his father, and perhaps, after me, the sexton of the parish, while with the lessons he is about to receive, he may one day be a skilful artist, the glory of his country, the consolation in our old days. Come on, a little courage, my good Marie. Besides, he added, glancing at his wife's rounded figure, we won't be alone for long, our family will soon increase, and all our children won't always be able to stay with us; and if it is for their good, it is better to part with them early.

All this was certainly very reasonable; but one rarely reasons with one's heart and especially with a mother's heart. However, Marie finally gave in, and however painful this separation was for her, she consented to it in the interest of her child. However, she managed to get the stranger to leave only the next day. In the evening, the family concert took place as usual, minus the gaiety that usually presided over it. The presence of the stranger had electrified little Joseph: he played the violin, the harp; and he sang better than he had ever done. Reutter seemed delighted with his new pupil; Father Mathias dreamed of the best future for his son; but the poor mother could not hear without a secret pain this voice so young, so tender, which would no longer marry hers, and tears flooded his face and contrasted singularly with the joyful and naive face of little Joseph. At this moment he saw only the happiness of being able to devote himself entirely to the study of music. Ah! it is that children can never love their parents as much as they are loved by them! However, the next day, at the time of departure, many tears were shed on both sides. The car had been driving for a quarter of an hour, while Marie was still kneeling in a corner of her room, calling down Heaven's blessings on the poor little traveler. Father Mathias also had a heavy heart. Mechanically he had set to work, and he was trying to sing so as not to let his grief be seen; but, in spite of himself, all the melodies that came to him were grave and sad, and yet the carriage was still moving, and little Joseph, captivated by the variety of objects which presented themselves to his sight for the first time, had again become gay and carefree, as one is at his age. He also sang; but the tunes he chose were all gay and lively. It's quite simple: the weather was magnificent, the countryside pleasant, the sun splendid; Joseph was barely nine years old; he drove in a good car; he was walking towards the unknown: at his age, it doesn't take that much to be perfectly happy. Scarcely would he have thought of those he was leaving if a bump in throwing him on his neighbor had made him feel something hard in his jacket; he quickly put his hand in his pocket, and took out a little paper on which was this inscription: seduced by the variety of objects which presented themselves to his sight for the first time, had again become gay and carefree, as one is at his age.

Scarcely would he have thought of those he was leaving if a bump in throwing him on his neighbor had made him feel something hard in his jacket; he quickly put his hand in his pocket, and took out a little paper on which was this inscription:To my beloved Joseph . It contained six florins. It was all the savings of the poor mother; this year, she had to deprive herself of many things; but the poor woman knew little of the price of money, and what she regarded as a treasure, by the difficulty she had in amassing it, she believed would be the beginning of a fortune for her son. The child thought like her: this sum, which amounts to about 15 fr. of our currency, seemed enormous to him; he did not know what sacrifice his mother was making in giving her to him, and his joy was even greater on seeing himself at the head of his six florins with a future as beautiful as the one he dreamed of. The uniform movement of the car, to which he was not accustomed, soon gave him a sweet sleep,Little Joseph's travel companion was delighted with his acquisition; he had to recruit pretty voices for the performance of his masses, which took place every Sunday in the cathedral of Vienna. It was rare that he met subjects as distinguished as the one he had just discovered, and then, the child's ardor for his musical studies made him hope that he could one day make of him a skilful singer whose talent would benefit him; in this he followed the custom of some masters who trained for freepupils: these then gave up in payment to their professors the benefit which they drew from their talent during the first years of its exploitation. This custom still exists in England, where one buys musical education at the cost of one or more years of one's time, when one has no means of paying otherwise. But little Joseph could not suspect this calculation: he took for benevolence and affection what was only a well-reasoned interest, and Reutter seemed to him like providence, like a second father. Happy age, in which one imagines only generous passions, because one judges others according to oneself, and only experiences noble feelings!

As long as the car was moving, nothing interrupted our little Joseph's sleep. It was only when she stopped in front of the venerable cathedral of Vienna that her traveling companion saw fit to wake him up.

“Come on, my little friend, we have arrived, we must get off.

— The child did not need to be told twice; in two leaps he was at the bottom of the post-chaise, and although it was already almost dark, he could admire the gigantic towers of the marvelous church.

-How? 'Or' What! he cried, that's where we're going to stay; Oh! let's hurry in; it must be beautiful inside! Reutter took him by the hand; they went around the church, then finally found a small door. An old woman seemed to be waiting for them there.

"Here, Marthe," said Reutter as he entered, "here's a new boarder I'm bringing to you, take him to his comrades, and prepare a room for him." The child soon found himself ushered into a low room, where a dozen toddlers were standing; in the absence of the master, they gave it their all and seemed to be enjoying themselves. The arrival of Marthe and the newcomer interrupted their games.

"Oh that! said the old woman, I hope all this noise will end, Master Reutter is back, and he's brought you a comrade; now think of keeping yourselves a little quiet.”

The news of Master Reutter's return darkened for a moment those mischievous little faces; but all attention soon turned to poor Joseph; he had remained standing in the middle of the room, somewhat embarrassed about himself. He first examines the local: it was not brilliant. Nothing on the walls, except a few greenish tints produced by the humidity, and names and dates inscribed in pencil, ink, charcoal, at the point of the knife, in all manners finally, according to the eternal custom. of all schoolchildren, and despite the famous precept: Nomina stultorum semper parietibus insunt . But as, according to another adage, numerus stultorum est infinitusThis cannot prevent the walls of colleges, boarding houses and other prisons intended for the education of youth from always being decorated with the names of those who inhabit them. A few wooden benches, an old harpsichord, and an enormous desk on which one saw two antiphonaries open for a lesson in plainsong, formed all the furnishings of this room, scarcely lighted by a copper lamp once gilded, but probably to reform for a long time as unworthy to figure in the sanctuary. The darkness was therefore almost complete, and moreover there reigned in the room that damp and indefinable odor which one finds only in churches and in the buildings which depend on them. The aspect of this stay would perhaps have somewhat disenchanted our new altar boy,

"What is your name, you?" one of them told him.

"Joseph," replied our hero, delighted with this familiarity, which put him at ease, and you?

— My name is Max; but you must not say: And you! between comrades, it is necessary to immediately get familiar with each other. Come on, are you a good kid? what do you know how to play?

“I,” continued Joseph, “will play whatever you like, and if it pleases you, I will play the harp or the violin for you, or I will sing something with you.”

A universal burst of laughter greeted poor Joseph's proposal.

"Is he stupid!" said his comrades to each other; you talk to him about having fun, and he replies that he wants to make music.

“But, Joseph,” Max told him, “you don't think about talking to us about singing; we do just that from morning to night!

"And does that bother you?" replied Joseph quickly.

"I believe so, we are obliged to do so!" and we hardly have one or two hours in the whole day to amuse ourselves a little.

-Oh! I'm not like you, me: my greatest entertainment will be making music.

A murmur of discontent greeted this reflection… It will be a capon , they whispered in their ears… At all, resumed Max, it's a hot one , and that's all; but it will soon pass. Marthe came again to interrupt the discussion. She brought each a piece of bread and an apple; the basket was empty when it was Joseph's turn; but she took him by the hand.

“Master Reutter will make you sup with him, my little friend; don't get used to it, it's good for today, but tomorrow you'll share the meal with these gentlemen.

And these gentlemen, while gnawing on their apples, watched the newcomer with an eye of envy, for he was going to make a meal a little more substantial than theirs.

Joseph soon found himself face to face with Reutter. The room was a little more cheerful: at first you could see more or less clearly, and then a good fire was burning in the stove, the walls were lined with shelves covered with books and sheet music; in a corner of the room was a small organ case, not far from it a harpsichord and several other instruments. The sight of these musical riches would have sufficed to enchant Joseph; but it must be confessed, to the shame of his heart and the praise of his appetite, that his attention was first absorbed by a little table where there were only two place settings; but it was abundantly served, and, at a sign from Reutter, he installed himself there at once.

The poor child had never drunk wine: he tasted a little; he never stopped talking music all through supper, and when he left the table he thought himself the most fortunate mortal that existed in the world. When he went to bed, however, he felt that something was missing: it was his mother's kiss, which served him as a blessing every evening: a tender regret almost made him shed tears; but he thought of the joy she must have felt at knowing he was happy, and he fell asleep thinking of her and thanking God for all that was happening to her; for, I can see, he said to himself, it is here that I am going to find happiness; he cannot be anywhere else.
