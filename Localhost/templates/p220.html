Among the villages which the games of fantasy and speculation have raised in the vicinity of Paris, there is perhaps none prettier and fresher than Maisons. Fashion has spoiled it a little by multiplying gardens and cottages; but it has not been able to destroy either the beauty of the Seine which borders it, nor the royal majesty of the avenues which surround it. Long paths lined with tall trees pierce the park in all directions, and reveal, behind a quivering curtain of foliage, pavilions and villas in which the luxury of the owners, people of finance for the most part, has lavished a thousand costly researches. ; but with the first breaths of the north wind, the chilly guests of these pretty dwellings disappear: you no longer see anyone in Maisons, except in the village, which

However, one of these villas was still inhabited towards the end of November 184.... This villa, located in the open field at the end of the park and on the side of the Seine, consisted of a single main building in the middle of a garden enclosed by quickset hedges. All white and pierced with windows with green shutters, this main building was one storey above the ground floor. It looked clean and honest, and seemed destined to lodge some good annuitant retained in Maisons by the energy of his rural tastes. The garden, planted with vegetables and rather unsuitable fruit trees, was divided into small compartments, the angular contours of which were drawn by boxwood. An arbor, a wooden bench and a few still young poplars completed the decoration.

This small estate was known in the country as the White House . It might well have in all an extent of half an arpent; but, the door of his garden passed, the owner of the White House had around him walks to tire the legs of a schoolboy. A large meadow separated it from the Seine; the park of houses, with its thick woods, was over there, behind the arbour, and further on, enclosed by a high wall running under a clump of elms and lime trees, the forest of Saint-Germain.

The guest at the White House was then a young man who could have been in his thirties and who was called Georges de Francalin. The staff of the house consisted of an old servant who answered to the name of Pétronille, always growling, of a grizzled old servant named Jacob, who never spoke, and a hunting dog of the breed of spaniel. white and tan: everyone in Maisons knew Tambour .

What motive could have induced Georges de Francalin to prolong his stay at Maisons well beyond the time when everyone hastened to return to Paris? That's what no one knew. Was it to escape the feverish agitation which then tormented the whole of France? Had he been ruined, like so many others, following the events of February! Was this retirement due to a domestic misfortune or some of those springtime misfortunes which cause so many tears to be shed, and which are later remembered with a smile? Jacob might have been able to tell; but Jacob, as we know, did not speak. Georges had arrived at the White House towards the end of April with Petronille, Jacob and Tambour. Three or four large cases filled with books had followed him; he had bought a canoe, a gun, tunics,

We know that in Paris a change of address puts more insurmountable barriers in relations than the hereditary hatred of two families did between the Capulets and the Montagues in the past: when he left for the countryside, Georges had therefore left for the exile. Only two or three of his friends remembered that he lived in Maisons. He lived with Tambour and chatted with his books. His habits were the most regular in the world; he never knew the day before what he would do the next day. He went to bed late or early, depending on the weather, one day with the sun, and the next day with the moon. If he left with the intention of reading in some corner of the wood, he would be surprised rowing on the Seine with the anxious ardor of a smuggler. He lunched sometimes at home, sometimes at the inn, which, to say it in passing, was Petronille's despair, obliged to wait for him near a cutlet which was blackening on the grill. No one was more active or more lazy: he scoured the countryside like a hunter, or lay stretched out in the grass like a lazzarone; but almost always Tambour was there. It must be said, however, that Tambour, except on hunting days, had rather vagabond habits; he stayed at home only on rainy days and only returned at mealtimes; he spent the rest of the time running about in all directions, pushing open all the doors and occupying himself with the affairs of others with an indiscretion which feared neither remonstrances nor rebuffs. As soon as you saw an orange-colored muzzle appear somewhere, you cried out: “There's Tambour!

It was then, as we know, towards the end of November; the countryside had those pale, veiled tints which are sometimes more pleasing than the bright colors and the joyful brilliance of summer. There were hardly any leaves left on the trees, except for the oaks all crowned with branches that the first cold weather had smeared with rust. The sun was barely showing. Every minute great flocks of crows crossed the gray sky and filled the space with their sinister cries. Georges no longer met in his walks except the pedestrian in charge of delivering the letters, and the fishermen with whom he had made acquaintance; but this solitude and the harshness of the season made them dearer to him, and never perhaps had he made them so long or so frequent.

One morning, therefore, Georges had gone out quite early; he carried his rifle and crossed the meadow in the direction of the Seine. Hunting is prohibited at all times in the park and the outbuildings of Maisons; but the hunters sometimes amuse themselves during the winter by shooting the birds of passage which fall among the reeds of the shore, or which are surprised in the creeks formed by the bed of the river. Such was not Georges' intention that day; he had a rifle, because this rifle had been in his hand when he left the White House. Tambour had looked at his master, and realizing from the movement of his eyes that he was not needed, he had gone off, his tail in the air, in search of a certain black bull to whom he had declared the war. The bull, who was young and good-looking, had accepted the challenge, and, like a valiant knight, he was as eager to run to meet Drum as Drum was to run to meet his horns. The bull, having lifted its muzzle, sniffed the dog and galloped off; the two adversaries met halfway, and the combat began immediately in the meadow.

Georges left the spaniel struggling with the bull, and soon reached the banks of the Seine. Two crows, which were digging the grass with their beaks, looking for their food, left at his sight; Georges took aim at them and fired. The two crows flapped their wings and plunged into the sky. “Bird devils! it is written that I will always miss them!” said George, stamping his foot.

A flock of crows rose from the edge of the river at the noise of this double report, and began to flit about in all directions. Some flew over Georges' head, coming and going, others fled at the top of their wings in the direction of the forest; some, the boldest or the youngest, fell into the meadow and ran hither and thither. M. de Francalin reloaded his gun and set off in pursuit; but the watchful birds soon moved away, and no matter how hard he tried to shoot them, he could not hit any of them. The hunter persisted, and noticing that the crows crossed the river every minute, he thought he might be happier in a canoe.

He ran towards a kind of cove that the Seine had dug in the sand and that a small point of earth protected against the eddy. A pretty little boat painted black with a white stripe floated there, the prow held to the roots of a willow by a padlocked chain. The name of the canoe, La Tortue , was written in beautiful red letters on the stern, near the rudder. Georges opened the padlock, jumped into the canoe and pushed off. In spite of its name, the Tortoise sped through the water like an arrow, and, pushed by the vigorous impulse of the oars, it had soon reached the middle of the current, which it ascended in the direction of the wooded spur which separates the Park of Houses of the Drawnof Saint Germain. As he was rowing, Georges heard the sound of a body falling into the water: it was Tambour, whom all this din of gunshots had drawn to the shore, and who had just bravely started to swim to join the boat. canoe. His master waited for him, picked him up quickly and continued on his way, watching the crows fluttering on both banks.

A slight mist, which had been floating over the countryside since morning, cleared away at this moment, and a bright ray of sunshine brightened the landscape. Arrived at the height of Herblay, Georges let the Tortoise slide in the current of the water, and, squatting at the back, like a fisherman tending his nets, he waited, his hand on his rifle, for one of the birds to passed within his reach. Tambour, seated at the other end of the boat, wisely imitated his master's complete immobility. He was shivering, but you could sometimes see the tip of his tail wagging.

M. de Francalin's ruse succeeded. Soon a crow came lumbering down and passed over the canoe. The hunter shouldered and fired. At the first blow, the crow took off, at the second, it pirouetted on itself, brushed the water with the tips of its black wings, and went to fall in the grass a few steps from the shore.

"At last!" cried M. de Francalin.

As he stood up to recognize the place where the bird was struggling, he heard a cry near Herblay. He turned his head and saw a child who had just slipped into the river and was clinging to the end of a rope that hung alongside a boat. A little girl was leaning over the edge of this boat, trying to get her comrade out and calling for help with all her might.

"To you! to you!" shouted a man whose boat was downstream on the Frette side.

M. de Francalin jumped on the oars and made the Tortue fly . Water was gushing around the bow; every moment he turned his head to see how far still separated him from the children.

"Hold on! he said; hold on, little one!”

He was only a few fathoms from the boat when the child's hands, numb with fatigue and cold, let go. The little girl suddenly leaned over when she saw him disappear and jumped over the edge. The current took them both and carried them away. Georges let go of the oars and, taking off his jacket, threw himself into the river. Drum jumped after him.

In four armfuls, the hunter had reached the little girl, whom her thick woolen petticoats kept on the surface of the water. He seized her vigorously by the arm, and swimming with one hand, he deposited her on board the boat. "Hold still now," he said; and he went back into the water, looking in all directions.

Nothing could be seen but the surface of the river, scratched here and there by a breath of wind.

"Look for! look for!" shouted Georges to Tambour, who was swimming beside him.

A slight bubbling, which he saw some distance above the water, showed him the place where the little boy had sunk. He pushed into it with all his might; but Drum had already preceded him, and, suddenly diving, he soon reappeared, holding the tail of a jacket in his mouth. Two inert legs and two motionless arms hung from either side of its muzzle. Georges seized the child and lifted him out of the river without Tambour wanting to let go, and they both arrived on the shore, where rescuers and rescued found the little girl, who was crying bitterly.

“Oh! my God! she would say, here are my lost petticoats!... Mama is going to beat me!”

Georges was very embarrassed between these two children, one of whom was sobbing while the other gave no sign of life.

"Its good! he said to the little girl, we'll give you other skirts; walk ahead and lead us to your mother's house."

But, while he was speaking, the man in the boat landed near him, and jumped on the sand. “Oh! he said, it's the little ones à la Thibaude.... She's going to arrange them, the good woman!

He picked up the child Georges was rubbing.

"Good! he resumed, the heart beats; he will be left with fear.

—Of course, Canada? said George.

—Hey! Yes. Here it is blowing already.... Add a cold to the fear, if you like, and that will be all.”

The fisherman stripped the child of his clothes, all soaked with water, and wrapped him in a coat of thick wool.

"He mustn't get cold," he went on. If my caban suffers from it, we'll see to it, and now on the way.... I'll take care of the little one, follow the little one.... You seem a little pale to me; with that wind, it's not good for you here."

The fact is that M. de Francalin was shivering; the water that flowed through his clothes was icy cold, and the blowing wind made it feel even colder. He did not answer, and began to walk very quickly. As for Tambour, to whom his dog's conscience gave good testimony, he ran forward with great gambols, and thrust his curious muzzle into all the bushes.

After a hundred steps, the little girl stopped short: "Here's mom!" she cried. And, all trembling, she took refuge between M. de Francalin's legs.

A group of women and children, in front of whom ran a peasant woman in a red petticoat, appeared in the middle of the road. All the women spoke at once; only the one who walked first was mute. The children were making a loud noise.

"It's nothing! mom, it's nothing! it is alive!" cried the little one.

La Thibaude waved him away and jumped on the little boy like a wolf.

“So it was true, what the girl told me to Claude! she cried. Jacques had fallen into the water.

—Hey! yes, replied Canada, and he didn't die of it!"

La Thibaude only had eyes for the little boy, and turned him upside down. The violence of the mother's kisses and the warmth of the big coat had brought the child back to life: he opened his eyes and began to cry. Her mother, who was as white as a shroud, turned red like her petticoat; she laid him abruptly on her knees, and with the back of her hand gave him half a dozen vigorous taps that rang on the bare flesh.

"That'll teach you to fall in the river, you bad rascal!" she says.

Little Jacques was no longer crying, he was screaming.

“And you, what were you doing in the boat? continued La Thibaude, looking for her daughter; but the little girl was huddled between M. de Francalin's knees, and was careful not to approach.

—Hey! sorry! she was playing, replied Canada.... Do you want to prevent children from playing now?... It runs after the pieces of wood that come down the river, he's young, he's dizzy, and he's rolling in the water.... It's happened to me ten times....

"No one is talking to you," said La Thibaude.

"No one speaks to me, but I answer.... Instead of beating your little fellow, I think you'd do better to thank this gentleman, and to pet this brave dog a little, without whom you never would not have had the chance to see the child again.

La Thibaude, a little confused, turned to M. de Francalin. Her eyes were full of tears.

"So it's you, sir!" she said.... If I dared, I would kiss you heartily.

"Never mind, let's kiss," replied Georges, combining action with words; and now that we are good friends, let me beg the pardon of this little girl, who is very much afraid of being scolded.

"It's because she also deserves it.... Always in the boats!" See how it is made.

-Oh! that concerns me! resumed Georges.... I promised to help her change her skirts, and here's what to do about it."

He took a louis from his waistcoat pocket; but as he gave it he turned quite pale, and leaned against the trunk of a tree. It seemed to him that everything revolved around him.

"Devil! do you have any idea of ​​feeling ill? says Canada.

-I'm cold." replied George.

At this moment, a woman who had not yet been seen approached the group. She was covered with a very simple black dress and a cloth pelisse.

“Oh! here is Mrs. Rose! cried the little girl, who, without noticing the water with which she was inundated, ran towards the lady in the black dress, and threw herself into her legs.

"Didn't any misfortune happen to his brother?" Madame Rose asked La Thibaude.

-Oh! no Madam; there he is, and here is the gentleman who pulled him out of the water.”

Madame Rose looked at Monsieur de Francalin. George wanted to bow, but he staggered; a cloud passed before his eyes, and he fell at the foot of the tree.

When he came to himself; M. de Francalin was seated in a large armchair in front of a good fire. It seemed to him that his limbs had regained their elasticity and warmth. Canada was standing in front of him, holding in his hand a piece of brandy-soaked flannel with which he had just rubbed it vigorously.

"Where are we? said George, casting his eyes in all directions.

—Sorry! you are not in my house! You would have to look in many houses to find these beautiful armchairs and these clocks with checkers all in gold!... There aren't two like that in all of Herblay! And how it sounds!... huh? Looks like a small bell....

-Midday! exclaimed Georges!...Good!...Petronille will receive me well!»

He made a movement; the blanket he was wrapped in parted, and he saw that his legs were bare."Lady! said Canada, answering M. de Francalin's looks, "you really had to undress from head to toe!" Don't you dare pass out like a miss? I've been rubbing you for an hour. Here's the bottle and here's the flannel. The whole bottle went into it, an eau-de-vie which would bring the dead back to life, and which I tasted to see. Ms. Rose does not trade on quality.

"Mrs. Rose?...that young woman in black?...Am I by any chance at her house?"

-Take! so you haven't looked at the clock? No sooner were you on the ground than she demanded that you be taken to her house. I took you on my shoulders and didn't stop until I put you in this chair. Hey! hey! the coast is steep; it was only upstairs that I noticed it.

"Poor Canada! Ah, that!" but I can't stay in this costume at Madame Rose's... a blanket and nothing underneath!

“Don't bother! We are not rich, but we have two complete suits. Here are shoes where you will be like in a boat, and a tunic that will keep you warm without suffocating you; give me that."

He spread the clothes on a chair and rubbed his hands.

“Hey! hey! he resumed with a sly look, that's a good race and an hour of friction. Fatigue is nothing, the morning is wasted.

Georges, who had known Canada for a long time, smiled.

"Good! we will make it up to you, he said.

-Oh! I'm not talking about anything, exclaimed Canada; I know that with you we play who loses wins.... Pass me that woolen shirt; it's warm as a fleece.”

Georges dressed in haste; he longed to apologize to Mrs. Rose and thank her.

'She seemed pretty to me,' he went on as he buckled Canada's wide trousers.

-Pretty! exclaimed the fisherman, with an expression of the most marked disdain....Pretty! Here's an idea! but haven't you seen it? There are pretty girls in the country: Louison, Catherine, Pierrette; but Mrs. Rose! she resembles them like a carnation stalk to a sprig of sorrel!

-Devil!

—Ah! you laugh! Maybe it's because I love him; but I imagine that the queens of fairy tales must have been made like Mrs. Rose.... The water of the river must have blinded you to say of Mrs. Rose that she seemed pretty to you!”

A soft knock on the door interrupted Canada.

"What is that? he said.

“I came to hear news of the patient; how is he?" asked a voice with a soft, silvery tone.

Canada ran to the door and opened it.

"Oh! you can come in; it is upright and all swarming like a pike,” he said.

Madame Rose greeted Georges with a smile.

“You are no longer cold; maybe you are hungry; do you want lunch?” she says.

M. de Francalin glanced at his suit, then looked at her.

"Oh! in the countryside!" she went on with a pretty shrug of the shoulders.

The acquaintance was made; George accepted. As he followed Mrs. Rose into an adjoining room where the table was set, Canada leaned into her ear.

"Well! he said, do you still think she's pretty?

"It is true," replied Georges; pretty isn't the word: she has something that isn't that and that's better than that.

"Here," said Canada, "she has her heart in her eyes."It was the first time that Georges had seen Madame Rose, and now that he had looked at her, he explained to himself very clearly Canada's odd feeling. One could not say of Madame Rose that she had the figure of a goddess, the hair of Cypris, the profile of a cameo, and all those perfections which poets willingly grant to their divinities. Was she beautiful? was she pretty? we didn't know. She seduced by a singular charm which was in her and which enveloped you gently like the penetrating heat of a hearth where a clear fire shines. This charm came neither from the purity of her features, which were not extremely regular, nor from the size and brilliance of her eyes, which one could see without being dazzled by them: it came from the harmony, that rare and precious gift. It was impossible to wish her a more delicate nose or a smaller mouth: it seemed that each of her features was precisely what it ought to be, and that they had been made expressly for her; the sound of the voice matched the expression of the gaze; the smile was just as expected from her lips, and when we left her, we did not think that she could be better or otherwise than we had seen her.

The day after this first meeting, Georges could not have said whether Madame Rose was dark-haired or blond. It seemed to him, on looking, that she had light brown hair and dark blue eyes, but he didn't. wasn't sure; he only remembered that she had a great youthful appearance with a thoughtful air which enhanced the grace of her countenance. When she spoke, she looked you very frankly in the eye; a pretty smile brightened the corner of his mouth, which seemed made for the truth. She was naturally joyful and lively, and yet a veil of melancholy was spread over her brow, and her gaze sometimes had something sad and plaintive about it, like that of a wounded dove. It was less a gleam than a fleeting flash; but he does

M. de Francalin had asked Madame Rose permission to see her again, if only to thank her for her hospitality, and she had granted it to him without hesitation. He therefore returned to Herblay the next day; but that day Madame Rose was out walking.

"She often goes there when it's light," said a good woman who took care of the household. "If you want to meet Madame Rose, you must come around eleven or noon."

As he descended the Herblay hill, M. de Francalin saw Canada picking up sand from the river. In three strokes of the oar, he was near him.

"If you had hailed me earlier when you passed with the Tortoise , I would have saved you the trouble of going up there," Canada told him.

"So you knew that Madame Rose was not at home?"

—Sorry! since I just drove her to the farm, on the other side of the water....

"And who will bring her back?"

"Me then!" Don't I have arms and a boat? don't we have to earn our poor living?”

Georges, lit a cigar with a Canada pipe.

“Say, old man, if you put aside your pole and your sand?... I have my cast net here, and we could get enough to fry on the way up the river.”

The fisherman looked down at Georges and shook the ashes from his pipe with a shrewd air.

“That is to say, Monsieur Georges, that you want to talk to me about Madame Rose.... You said to yourself like this: “I don't know the rose of Herblay; “Canada knows her, let the old man talk.”

George smiles.

"Well! I'm the devil, resumed Canada; let me moor my shoe to a few willow trees, and I'll go aboard the Tortue .... We'll bring Mrs. Rose back with her.... That doesn't prevent it, he grumbled, approaching the shore, that this conversation is going to make me miss my day.... This sand that I am fishing is full of scrap iron, and there is profit in picking it up.

"Do we not know that all work deserves a salary?" Always come,” Georges said.

The boat tied, Georges took the oars, Canada the cast net, and they went up the Seine in the direction of the fired ones of Saint-Germain.

“Well, what would you like to know? resumed the fisherman.

-A little bit of everything.
