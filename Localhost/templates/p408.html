About the year 1820 Nic√©phore Niepce made the discovery that bitumen, under certain conditions, was sensitive to light. He dissolved it in oil of lavender, and spread a thin layer of the solution thus obtained upon stone. This he exposed under a drawing (making the paper transparent by waxing), and after sufficient exposure, oil of lavender was poured on. Those portions of the bitumen which had been exposed to the action of the light had become insoluble, and so remained while the lines which had been protected by the drawing were dissolved away. By treating the stone with an acid these lines were bitten or eroded, and could be printed from. Niepce afterward employed metal plates instead of the stone.

Here we have the foundation for a number of printing processes of the present day, including photogravure.

For many years, however, progress in processes for intaglio printing was very slow. In 1852 Talbot introduced a process termed photoglyphy, and in 1854 Paul Pretsch, of Vienna, patented a process which he termed photogalvanography. In 1870 the late Walter B. Woodbury, inventor of the Woodburytype process, suggested to M. Rousselon, of M. M. Goupil & Co.,[A] a process which he had discovered, and which he describes[B] as follows:

"The method, as perhaps many of your readers know, is based on the fact that some pigments used in carbon [Pg 6]printing have an unpleasant habit of granulating when mixed with gelatine and bichromate, destructive to their use in carbon printing and Woodburytype, but bearing the essence of success in an engraving process where grain is necessary. The origin of this method was simply owing to my getting some bad reliefs, in which this effect was first noticed. Out of this arose the photo-engraving process which, as I said before, is now claimed as the invention of a Frenchman. But I am digressing.

"This relief, possessing a suitable grain, could, by hydraulic pressure, be made to transfer its minutest details to metal without any loss to fineness, so giving a plate possessing all the properties of a mezzotint. The methods hitherto used of electrotyping would have proved useless, as all detail would have been lost. The same thing applies to the new method I am now about to bring before your readers. The latter process of getting the grain transferred to a hard metal remains the same; but the novelty is in the method of producing the grained plate. To those who have practiced the process of enameling, as used by Geymet and Alker, and others, my description will be better understood.

"I first coat a thin, polished steel plate (zinc will answer) with a very thin coating of gum, glucose, and bichromate as used for enameling. This I dry rapidly, and, while still warm and desiccated, expose under a glass positive. On removal from the frame after exposure the plate is made to take up a slight amount of moisture by breathing on it.

"During this stage I brush or dust over it any hard powder, such as emery, powdered glass, etc, but these I keep of different degrees of fineness or coarseness. No. 1, is of a coarse quality, and is used first; No. 2 is finer; and No. 3 is of the finest grain obtainable. These are obtained by passing through muslin of different degrees of fineness. Having in the first stage of moisture used the No. 1, or coarsest,[Pg 7] powder, after a time No. 2 is dusted over and adheres to the middle tints, while the very finest tones, which have almost lost their sticky qualities by the exposure to light, are treated to No. 3.

"Now we possess a granular picture having all the true qualities required in a photo-engraved plate, or, rather, such as will give a reverse in metal having these qualities. The steel or zinc plate is then to be exposed to light to completely harden the mixture all over, and is then treated exactly as in my other engraving process; that is, pressed into soft metal by hydraulic pressure, electrotyped, and then the surface is aciercised or coated with steel. The dark parts are thus represented by a coarse grain, the middle tints by a medium grain, and the finest shades by the most infinitesimal particles, thus meeting all requirements necessary to a successful photo engraving process."

This process was taken up by a Frenchman and claimed by him as his own invention. The chief difficulty with it was that the plates before being perfect require the work of a skillful engraver, sometimes for weeks. They were therefore very costly, six dollars per square inch being charged for the making of the plate alone.

Klic's process, 1886, was the next important improvement in photogravure or intaglio printing, and since then many other processes and improvements have been introduced by Obernetter, Waterhouse, Colls, Zuccato, Sawyer and others.

In the following chapters Mr. H. R. Blaney gives a working description of the process as practiced to-day by many of the leading firms in this and other countries. This originally appeared in the columns of The Photographic Times, but I have made many additions that I have imagined may be of value to the student. A dividing line will be found between Mr. Blaney's writings and my own additions.

CHAPTER I.
The Negative.
Any negative may be used for photogravure, that is, taken from nature, or from a painting or engraving, provided it is reversed, and, in the case of paintings, should, in addition, be on an orthochromatic plate. The negative should be soft and brilliant, well exposed, and not hard or under-exposed. A reversed negative is always necessary if the print from the copper plate is required to be similar in regard to right and left, or if no other means are to be taken, to reverse the image upon the copper plate. Professionals use stripping plates especially made for this purpose for small work, or the reversed negative may be made in the copying camera. A fairly good reversed negative can be made by contact in the printing frame from an albumen print from the original negative, the print made transparent with white wax by being placed on a piece of warm, clean metal and the wax rubbed over the face. To have the negative reversed, the print should first be placed, face out, against the glass of the printing frame, with its back against the sensitive surface of the transparency plate, the back closed in and exposed to a large lamp for about five seconds. Every care must be taken that you use the best of negatives, carefully retouched if necessary, as the professional photographic etchers have informed me that (from their standpoint) the success of the whole process depends on the quality of the original negative and the care taken in artistic retouching.

It will often happen in commercial photogravure work that plates have to be made from all kinds of original nega[Pg 10]tives. In cases where these are flat from over-exposure it is well to make a carbon transparency; intensifying the image with a strong solution of permanganate of potash, and from this make a fresh negative upon a slow or Carbutt transparency plate.

Mr. Horace Wilmer says: "The class of negative most suitable is such as gives a good result by any of the printing processes. A bright sparkling negative will always give a good plate, but I do not find that any satisfactory results can be got from a soft flat negative. The negative should be as perfect as possible. It is absolutely useless to work from a faulty negative. Contrasts on it may be increased by retouching. Such contrasts are desirable because the tendency of the etching is to reduce them somewhat."

Perhaps the simplest way of obtaining a reversed negative is by placing the dry plate in the slide film inside and exposing through the glass, of course after allowing in focusing for the thickness of the glass plate. With the wet-collodion process, usually the method employed by large photomechanical printers, this method can be used because it is a simple matter to carefully examine the glass plate to be employed, but it will be obvious that with the ordinary dry plate all the imperfections of the glass, such as dirt, scratches, air-bubbles, etc., will be clearly reproduced in the image.

Another method largely employed to produce reversed negatives direct, is by means of a mirror or prism placed either before or behind the lens. The prism is the more convenient, but if large sizes are used it becomes a costly piece of apparatus. The mirror, which should be a plane of glass silvered on its surface, is a less expensive affair. By either of these means the reversed negatives can be made direct without suffering the least in quality.

With celluloid or other flexible films, printing can, of course, be done from either side. Practical men, however,[Pg 11] say that, except with the very thinnest films, there is an undoubted loss of sharpness in the grain when these films are reversed and with some mechanical processes.

Against this, however, it may be said that better contact can be obtained in printing than if the film were upon a piece of uneven glass, as is often the case, for by backing it with a piece of plate-glass perfect contact is ensured everywhere.

We come now to the method of stripping the film from the glass. If the negative is made by the collodion process the matter is a simple one. The glass is treated with French chalk previous to collodionizing. After the negative is made and dried it is laid on a leveling stand and a solution of gelatine poured on it. When dry, it is readily stripped by running a knife all round. With ordinary dry-plates the method usually recommended is to immerse them in dilute hydrofluoric acid. The difficulty often experienced here is in the lateral expansion of the film. This will largely depend upon the plate, or rather the quality of the gelatine used. There are, however, two methods of securing the films to some medium unaffected by moisture, and so prevent expansion or distortion. The first is that recommended by Mr. A. Pumphrey and the second by Mr. H. J. Burton, modified descriptions of which are given in a recent number of The British Journal of Photography. If the negative is varnished this is removed. A thin film of gelatine is moistened in a dilute solution of hydrofluoric acid, one part of acid to sixty of water. This gelatine film is secured on paper by a coating of india-rubber.

The action of the dilute acid is to soften the gelatine, making it very adhesive. It can, in this state, be readily attached to the negative by squeegeeing. The acid in the film passes through the negative, and releases it from the glass. It can then be lifted off and pinned to a flat surface[Pg 12] to dry. The paper can afterward be stripped off, when dry, by moistening the back with a little benzole to dissolve the india-rubber. In this manner we get the stripped negative in exactly the same size as when on the glass, to which it can be restored at any time desired.

Burton, in his method, employs collodion in place of paper as the support. The negative is first coated with a thick collodion, and this is allowed ten minutes or so to set. It is then immersed in plain water until the film loses all appearance of greasiness. A few drops of hydrofluoric acid are added to the water, and the dish gently rocked. The film will soon detach itself, when the plate should be at once rinsed. Another plate previously coated with gelatine, and dried, is placed in the dish, and the released film, after reversing, is floated upon it, the two removed together, and allowed to dry.

So far we have only treated upon reverse negatives, either obtained at once or reversed afterward. It often happens, however, that we have an ordinary negative, which is required to be reversed. This negative may be a valuable one, and the risk involved in stripping it be too great.

Another simple method of obtaining a reversed negative is by means of the powder process. Although this process is an old one, it appears to be but little known, for what reason we have never been able to define. It is by no means difficult, and by its means a negative can be obtained direct from a negative without the intermediate positive transparency.

The principle of the process is this: An organic tacky substance is sensitized with potassium dichromate, and exposed under a reversed positive to the action of light. All those parts acted upon become hard, the stickiness disappearing according to the strength of the light action, while those parts protected by the darker parts of the positive retain[Pg 13] their adhesiveness. If a colored powder be dusted over, it will be understood that it will adhere to the sticky parts only, forming a visible image, the same being a reproduction of the positive printed from. The process is very useful for the production of lantern slides and transparencies, or for the reproduction of negatives. Any of the following formul√¶ may be employed for the manufacture of the organic substance:‚Äî

Solution A.
Gum arabic	25 grammes
Grape sugar	60 grammes
Purified honey	15 grammes
Alcohol, 40 deg	15 c.c.
Water	60 c.c.
Solution B.
Saturated solution of ammonium dichromate.
Two solutions to be mixed together before using in proportions 15 A, 25 B, 50 water.

Woodbury's Formula.
Gum arabic	60 grains
Glucose	45 grains
Glycerine	10 minims
Potassium dichromate	30 grains
Distilled water	2 ounces
Obernetter Process.
Dextrine	60 grains
White sugar	75 grains
Ammonium dichromate	30 grains
Glycerine	2 to 8 minims
Distilled water	3 ounces
The gum is first dissolved and the remainder of the ingredients added. It may be necessary to warm the solution in a hot water bath to dissolve it. It is then filtered through flannel or clean muslin, and preserved for use in well-stoppered bottles. With this solution clear glass plates are coated and dried by a gentle heat over a small spirit lamp. The plate while still warm is exposed under a reversed positive[C] [Pg 14]for from two to five minutes in sunlight, and from 10 to 20 minutes in diffused light. The image is then but slightly visible. On removing from the printing frame the plate is laid in the air (protected from light) for a few minutes to absorb a little moisture from it. The next process is the "dusting on." If the image is required to be black, fine Siberian graphite is spread over it with a soft flat brush. This will adhere to the parts unaffected by light, giving an image of the positive. Any colored fine powder maybe used, giving images in various colors. When fully developed the excess of powder is dusted off and the film coated with collodion. After this it is well washed to remove the unaltered gum and dichromate salt. The film may, if desired, be detached from the plate and used for enamels, ivory, wood, textile fabrics, opals, etc.

CHAPTER II.
The Transparency.
Regular transparency gelatine dry plates are the handiest for making positives, especially for amateurs, if one does not care if the subject is in reverse, or if one has a reversed negative to work from. There is a "special" carbon tissue, price $4.00 per roll of 2 √ó 12 feet, made by the Autotype Company, of London, England, with full instructions appended; by a system of double transfer, reversed negatives may be obtained with this tissue. The "special" tissue is only to be used for the transparency. A safe edge of black paper is required on the transparency, pasted up exactly to the edge of the picture, on the glass side; it comes, sold in strips, gummed, ready for use, about ¬º inch wide; this is required, as the tissue used for the negative resist on the copper plate, which is printed from the transparency, must have a safe edge, shielded from the light, or it will not attach itself to the copper plate, the tissue coming inside half way. The screw pressure printing frame should have a piece of heavy felt for backing the transparency.

The following instructions for making carbon transparencies will no doubt be found useful:

The carbon tissue prepared for this process consists of paper coated with gelatine containing carbon, lamp-black, or other pigments.

The Autotype Company, of London, manufacture a special "transparency" tissue.

Cutting up the Tissue is performed by unrolling it gently upon a zinc cutting plate, cut square and true, with the inches marked at the bottom and right-hand side. By using a T[Pg 16] square and observing the numbered inches marked on the plate, it will not be difficult to cut the tissue to any dimension. If the tissue is very curly and unmanageable it should be kept down with convenient weights. After cutting it up to the required sizes, which should be conveniently smaller than the dish to be used for sensitizing, it should be kept flat under a metal plate.

Sensitizing the Tissue is the next operation. This is performed in a solution of potassium dichromate rendered alkaline with ammonia. Tie over the mouth of a two-gallon jug a piece of muslin, to form a kind of bag, into which place fifteen ounces of potassium dichromate, then fill up the jug with water and allow it to stand until the dichromate is dissolved and the solution becomes cold. It is sometimes advisable to regulate the quantity of dichromate. In hot weather, or for very thin negatives, the proportion of water should be doubled, while for very hard negatives only half the quantity should be used. In very hot weather it is often advantageous to replace about 30 per cent. of the water with the same quantity of alcohol.

The operation of sensitizing the tissue must be carried on in a room lighted by a window covered with a yellow blind. A flat dish of porcelain, glass, or papier mach√©, a squeegee, and a sheet of glass or zinc larger than the tissue, will be required.

The solution is poured into the dish, and should be at least two inches deep. The tissue is then immersed in it, and the air-bells that form immediately brush away from both sides with a broad camel's-hair brush. The temperature of the bath should not be higher than 60 deg. Fahr.; and the time of immersion should be from three to five minutes. After the tissue has remained in the solution for the allotted time it is gently removed and laid face downward upon the glass or zinc plate, and the back squeegeed, removing all superfluous[Pg 17] solution. The tissue is removed from the glass and laid over a sheet of cardboard, bent into the form of an arch, to dry.

Another method (H. J. Burton's) of sensitizing carbon tissue is to lay it flat on a sheet of clean blotting paper, and sponge on the back a very strong sensitizing solution composed as follows:

Potassium dichromate	4 ounces
Liquid ammonia fort	1 ounce
Water	20 ounces
First mix the ammonia with the water, then grind up and add the dichromate.

Drying the Tissue should be accomplished in a room perfectly free from the noxious fumes of other chemicals, and lighted only by non-actinic light. Tissues sensitized during the evening should be dry on the following morning. It should then be cut to the sizes required and kept flat in a pressure frame, or other similar contrivance.

Exposing the Tissue.‚ÄîThe tissue can be exposed behind the negative in an ordinary printing frame, or in special frames having no joint in the back, as no image is visible. The negative must be furnished with a safe edge, made by painting an edge about one-eighth of an inch round the negative with black varnish, or by pasting on strips of red or black paper. Exposure must be judged by an actinometer. A very suitable instrument for timing the exposure of carbon tissue is Sawyer's actinometer. It consists of a rectangular tin box with a glass lid, bearing twelve tints graduated from slight discoloration to a degree of opacity, representing the extreme amount of deposit upon the lights of the densest negatives, each division of this screen of tints bearing a number in opaque pigments; and a roll of sensitive paper is placed in the box, and the end pulled forward so as to pass under the tints. When this arrangement is placed in the light, the silver paper commences to discolor underneath the graduated[Pg 18] screen, beginning of course at the lightest, but the number on the tint being in an opaque pigment is preserved white, and serves to register the progress of printing; for if, when the lid is opened, the number one, for instance, shows clearly on a tinted ground, the instrument is said to have registered one tint; by that time the number two will have begun to make its appearance, and, if sufficient exposure be given, the light will print through the whole scale by successive steps, and show up the numbers, one to twelve. With an instrument of this kind it is evident that, by exposing alongside the carbon tissue and determining the number of tints required for the proper exposure of that negative, the same number of tints with the same negative will always prove right. A little practice will enable one to judge the number of tints required for every class of negative.

It will be well to remark here that freshly sensitized tissue will produce inferior pictures to that used a day or two after; the pictures are not so hard, and there is less danger of the high-lights being washed away.

Continuing Action of Light.‚ÄîIf the carbon tissue after exposure to the light, be kept in the dark for a little time the effect on the print will be precisely the same as if the exposure to light had been prolonged. This continuing action of light may often be utilized to advantage. Pictures known to be under-exposed will, if kept till morning, by that time have acquired the same force as if they had received the proper exposure.

Development consists simply in dissolving the gelatine unaffected by light, with hot water as the solvent.

Immerse the exposed tissue in a bath containing cold water. It will first of all curl up, but afterward lay flat and limp. It is then placed in another bath containing cold water together with a sheet of glass which has previously been coated with a 5 per cent. solution of gelatine. Bring[Pg 19] them together face to face, draw them out, and force into close contact with a large squeegee; then place between blotting paper for five or ten minutes. In squeegeeing, the tissue should be uppermost, and a sheet of American cloth laid over it to prevent the squeegee from damaging it.

Development should not be attempted for at least twenty minutes, during which time the glass, with the tissue on it, should be placed between sheets of blotting paper, and kept under pressure to insure its adherence to the glass support. After that time it is placed in a dish, and water heated to a temperature of 100 deg. F. added. The colored pigment will at once commence to ooze out of the edges, and after a little time the paper originally holding the carbon film may be removed with the hand. Then, by gently leveling the picture with the hand, the superfluous gelatine will be washed away, and if the exposure has been correct a perfect image should remain. A certain amount of control can be kept over an autotype picture. An over-exposed print will show itself by insolubility of the gelatine, and the high light refusing to be washed clear. The temperature should be raised considerably, and hot water poured over with a jug. If this fails to reduce the intensity, add a little ammonia to the water as a last resource, though the better plan is to make another print, giving less exposure. Under-exposure results in over-solubility of the gelatine. The half-tones will be washed clean away. It is rarely an under-exposed print can be saved. All that can be done is to reduce the temperature of the water. Development should never be hurried; the slower it is the better the gradation of tone in the results.

After development is complete the bichromate salt is discharged, and the image rendered perfectly insoluble by well washing in cold water and placing in a dish containing a 5 per cent. solution of potash alum, after which it is again washed and dried.[Pg 20]

Another method of making a transparency and one that involves less trouble is by means of the transparency plates which are now in the market. Of these we have tried Carbutt's with the greatest success. For these the following instructions are given:

The requisites are, a deep printing-frame a size larger than the negative to be used, with a flat glass bottom clear and free from scratches (crystal plate is best), a dark-room Lantern, or other artificial light, and Keystone Gelatino-Albumen Plates. Transparencies can be made same size of negative by contact and exposure to artificial light, or enlarged or reduced in the camera by daylight, with equal perfection in result. To make transparencies by contact place one of the Keystone thin crystal glass transparency plates over the negative in printing-frame, lay piece of dark soft material over it, close down the back, and expose to the light of the lantern or to a gas flame or other artificial light, for 10 to 30 seconds, according to density of negative, at a distance of 20 inches from the flame. Use the following developer:

Eikonogen and Hydrochinon Developer.
A.
Metric Weight.	 	Avoirdupois Weight.
600 c.c.m	Distilled Water	20 ounces
120 grammes	Sulphite of Soda Crystals	4 ounces
22 grammes	Eikonogen	330 grains
10¬Ω grammes	Hydrochinon	160 grains
960 c.c.m	Water to make up to	32 ounces
 
B.
Metric Weight.	 	Avoirdupois Weight.
600 c.c.m	Distilled Water	20 ounces
60 grammes	Carbonate of Potash	2 ounces
60 grammes	Carbonate Soda Crystals	2 ounces
960 c.c.m	Water to make up to	32 ounces
For use take 1 ounce (30 c.c.) of A, ¬æ ounce (25 c.c.) of B, with 4 ounces (120 c.c.) of water.[Pg 21]

More of A will increase density, more of B will increase detail and softness. Temperature of developer should not vary much below 65 deg. nor above 75 deg. The after treatment is same as with any other developer.

Let the development continue until the blacks look quite strong, and detail showing in the high-lights; wash off developer, then immerse in

Carbutt's New Acid Fixing and Clearing Bath.
4 c.c.m	Sulphuric Acid	1 drachm
480 grammes	Hyposulphite of Soda	16 ounces
60 grammes	Sulphite of Soda	2 ounces
30 grammes	[D]Chrome Alum	1 ounce
1920 c.c.m	Warm Water	64 ounces
Dissolve the hyposulphite of soda in 48 ounces (1440 c.c.m.) of water, the sulphite of soda in 6 ounces (180 c.c.m.) of water; mix the sulphuric acid with two ounces (60 c.c.m.) of water, and pour slowly into the sulphite soda solution, and add to the hyposulphite; then dissolve the chrome alum in 8 ounces (240 c.c.m.) of water and add to the bulk of solution, and the bath is ready. This fixing bath will not discolor until after long usage, and both clears up the shadows of the negative and hardens the film at the same time.

Let remain two or three minutes after transparency is cleared of all appearance of silver bromide. Then wash in running water for not less than half an hour to free from any trace of hypo solution. Swab the surface with wad of wet cotton, rinse, and place in rack to dry spontaneously. Then varnish with plain collodion.

[Pg 22]

CHAPTER III.
The Carbon Tissue‚Äî(Sensitizing and Exposure).
The carbon tissue used as a resist, which is mounted on the copper plate, is made by the Autotype Company, London, England. No. 100 Standard Brown is the right grade to use, though I have reached good results with No. 103. The No. 100 is a heavier grade than No. 103, and requires two or three minutes longer exposure than the latter. Use a deep printing frame with a screw pressure to secure absolute contact, which is known by iridescent markings appearing on the glass of the printing frame. A Johnson's actinometer is very useful to time the exposure. From 4 to 6 tints are necessary. Experience here is the only guide, as the light varies as well as the density of the negative and the sensitiveness of the tissue. If one does not have an actinometer, a slip of albumen paper may be used; as soon as the paper has reached the darkest point, which is then called one tint, extend it so that a fresh portion comes out to the light, and so on for the different tints. In September, for instance, the darkest tint is reached in about 3 to 4 minutes; two tints and a half or 8 minutes in the shade at midday on a clear day in September is about right,‚Äîthis is understood to be with medium negatives and No. 103 tissue sensitized within three days.

You should over-expose rather than under-expose, allowance being made when the acid is used. Print deeply, so that, on development, the negative tissue on the copper plate shows all the detail clearly in the shadows. The tissue should not appear very dark on the plate. The copper should show up through the gelatine clearly and brightly. The thinner the negative tissue, the quicker the biting of the acid.

[Pg 23]

Sensitizing the Tissue.
The carbon tissue comes only in rolls of 2¬Ω feet by 12 feet, price $3.00, not cut. It is not sold in a sensitive condition. Full instructions with each roll for sensitizing. Tap water will do, but I would suggest distilled water for making the sensitizing solution of bichromate of potassium.

Bichromate of potassium	1 ounce
Water	16 ounces
Alcohol	¬Ω drachm
Ammonia	12 drops
The best way to sensitize the tissue, is to place the tissue face up, keeping it flat so that the solution reaches all parts at once, removing all air bubbles, and rubbing in the solution with the fingers until pliant; the time of immersion is three minutes in winter, two minutes in summer. The hands should be washed directly after handling the solution, and care must be taken that there are no cuts on the fingers, as the solution is very harmful, but if due care is exercised and the hands well washed immediately with soap, little, if any, trouble will be experienced; use rubber finger tips as much as possible. Keep the temperature of the solution at 70 deg. both in summer and winter. Take a piece of glass free from scratches (an inch larger all round than the tissue); have the glass ready cleaned with ammonia and talcum powder of fine whiting, squeegee the sensitized carbon tissue directly from the solution on to the glass and place to dry at night in a light-tight box; it will be dry in the morning.

The tissue is in the best condition for three days after sensitizing; it can be used up to seven days; it gradually increases in sensitiveness from day to day. After a week or ten days has elapsed, it is hard to manage and becomes unreliable. When the tissue is dry take a sharp knife and cut inside the edge, and strip off one corner. Fairly good results can be reached by simply drying over a curved piece of pulp[Pg 24] board, which is tied with string on each end, but squeegeeing on glass gives a sharper result. The addition of ammonia and alcohol to the sensitizing solution makes it easier to strip the paper from the copper plate, after the carbon tissue is mounted on the plate, and enables one to develop the resist in the water at a lower temperature than without it, thus avoiding pits in the darker portions and white specks or bubbles in the lights, should the water reach too high a temperature.

CHAPTER IV.
The Cleaning and Graining of the Copper Plate, and Grade of Copper Necessary, and Where and How to Buy It at Reasonable Prices.
The best copper is recognized by its rosy lustre. Pure copper only should be used. It can be purchased ready polished and beveled from several firms in New York. The best way, if large quantities of plates are required, is to buy the copper in the rough of one firm and have it polished by another, and bevel it yourself if necessary with a file and burnish it by hand, or the firm who polish it will do the beveling for you.

The Scovill & Adams Co. supply copper-plates of the finest quality, ready polished, for photogravure work.

Total cost by this method about one-third less than by purchasing ready made. It makes a copper plate 1/16 grade, 9 √ó 11, cost about $1.10. Order your copper 1/16 in. grade up to 10 √ó 12; larger sizes 1/8 in. grade. If you use 1/16 in. grade above this size, the plate is liable to buckle. Be sure the plate is free from pits and scratches and with a high polish. Have what the polishers and engravers call a rouge polish. If they do not supply it, rouge it yourself with powdered rouge and turpentine, using a ball of absorbent cotton over a large piece of smooth cork. A good way to buy rouge is in the stick; it is more economical. Rub the wet cotton on it and the right quantity is assured. Pits in the copper may be taken out by tapping upon the back with a nail set, using a small piece of polished steel to lay the face of the plate on, and localizing the spot with a pair of calipers. The part raised by the tapping, cut away with the scraper, then rub[Pg 26] the spot with Scotch stone and water, then a piece of engraver's charcoal (cut to a pencil point), with machine oil; then burnish with the regular engraver's burnisher and sperm oil, finishing with rouge and refined turpentine.

When the plate is well polished, make a strong solution of caustic potash (C.P.), which comes in sticks, as strong as possible, as long as it does not stain the copper. It should register about 40 deg. with an actinometer used to test silver solutions.

Take a piece of absorbent cotton and clean the copper with potash (by the way, use finger tips); rinse under tap for five minutes, then a fresh piece of cotton with alcohol at 95 per cent., rinse again with water, and place in warm water for final rinsing; stand up on corner, or place in drying frame usually used for negatives; allow to drain. Should any stains appear, it must be recleaned and all the operations repeated until it drains off without streaks, for these streaks and spots of stain are caused by the caustic potassa, which is difficult to remove. It is as hard to get rid of from the copper as hyposulphite is from a negative. These streaks retard the acid on the copper wherever they appear, and cause defects in the recording of the original tones of the negative.

The plate is then ready for graining.
