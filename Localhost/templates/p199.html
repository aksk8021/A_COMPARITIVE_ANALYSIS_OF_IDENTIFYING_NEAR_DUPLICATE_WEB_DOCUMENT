If I had put a preface to the first edition of this little book, I would have saved myself a lot of trouble.

When it appeared for the first time, about nine months ago, it did not displease the readers of the Revue des Deux Mondes , a difficult public because Mme Sand and M. Mérimée spoiled it. I was forgiven for lengths that were unpardonable in a writer, excusable in a man who is learning to write. Nobody was harsh on me, and a lot of it was due to age and inexperience.

In the last days of May, a friend came running to warn me of a serious danger: a large format magazine was to denounce me as a plagiarist and inform the public that Tolla was only the translation of an Italian novel entitled: Vittoria Savorelli .

It is true that the characters of Lello and Tolla, and the main features of this story, were supplied to me by an Italian book printed in Paris. This book, which is not a novel, contains a large part of the original correspondence of the two lovers. Tolla lived at the time when I bring her to life. Lello, who is still alive, belongs to a princely, almost royal family from northern Italy. The letters of Lello and Tolla were published by the Savorelli family who had to take revenge. If this book had been a novel, it would have been allowed to circulate in Italy; but it was a file: we did everything we could to destroy the entire edition. However, I know of a dozen copies of Vittoria Savorelli in Rome.. There are several in Paris, as I was able to ascertain. A bookseller in Paris sold me mine.

The facts given in Vittoria Savorelli 's volume are of little interest. The plot that separated the two lovers is an anonymous plot whose perpetrators have remained unknown. It was Roman society as a whole that discovered the secret of their love; the pride of the Lello family did the rest. A translation of this book would be more than boring; it would be almost unreadable. One would only find anything excellent in it four or five letters in which pain rises to eloquence: it is useless to add that these are Tolla's letters. I translated them by abbreviating them. My borrowings from this correspondence form a little over fifteen pages of this new edition.

My share of invention consists of the education of Tolla, which is by no means Italian, and of his portrait, which is not like him; of all the characters that I have grouped around her, and of all the incidents, unfortunately too rare, which animate the story, the marquise and Pippo, the colonel and Rouquette, the general and her daughter, Menico, Amarella, Cocomero , have never existed except in my imagination. It is the same with the accomplices, such as Doctor Ély, Mlle Sarrazin, Cardinal Pezzato, Abbé Fortunati and the others. Lello never threw himself into the Tiber: the story says he was at the ball the day Tolla died. Cocomero never broke Menico's head, since neither the killer nor the victim existed.

I admit that I allowed myself to draw from an authentic file the first elements of a work of imagination: many others have done it, on whom no one has shouted haro. I borrowed a little and added a lot. To the things I borrowed, I tried to give the form , without which the works of the mind are nothing. However, I would still have a scruple if I had hidden the source from which I drew.

Far from concealing the existence of Vittoria Savorelli 's volume , and the use I had made of it, I showed the book to my friends, to the indifferent, and to all those I knew. The editor-in-chief of a special review, which aims to repress counterfeiting and plagiarism, has seen Vittoria Savorelli on my desk more than once; he told the public long before anyone thought of attacking me . I myself gave the honorable director of the Revue des Deux Mondes my copy of Vittoria Savorelli , before I was accused by anyone. Finally, the original manuscript of Tolla , which the Revue des Deux Mondeshas retained, contains the following passage:

[1] Literary and Artistic Property , May 16 issue, article by M. Guiffrey.

"This collection forms a volume in-8 o of 316 pages printed by Béthune et Plon, published by Daguin frères, under this title: Vittoria Feraldi , istoria del secolo XIX ..." and further: "The volume which I used has was discovered in Paris by M. Leclère son, broker in books, boulevard Saint-Martin, opposite the Château-d'Eau. »

This is not how plagiarists express themselves. Unfortunately this passage was deleted from the proofs. M. Buloz pointed out to me that these bibliographical details were not in their place in the body of the story, on the back of the death of Tolla. He further remarked that I could neither alter the title of the book by entitling it Vittoria Feraldi , nor display the real name of the Savorelli family. I therefore erased these two sentences on the proof, without touching the manuscript which was not in my hand, and I replaced them with this less explicit note, but which a plagiarist would have taken care not to add:

“Vittoria, history of the secolo XIX . Paris , 1841."

With this information and the Journal de la Librairie , the most inexperienced bibliomaniac would have found in five minutes the publisher, the printer, and this complete title of Vittoria Savorelli .

And yet, on June 1 , the Revue de Paris said to me:

“Learn, sir, that there is a book called Vittoria Savorelli . »

I answered. I had answered in advance by recounting, on May 31, in the Revue Contemporaine , how and with what materials I had made Tolla . But four or five newspapers, big and small, were already unleashed against me. One simply called me a plagiarist, the other treated me more familiarly as a thief, and a weekly Review which placed itself under the patronage of Minerve accused me of having sold the dignity of the man of letters to a merchant of striped clothes.

I can speak without bitterness of all these brutalities which made me pay dearly for a little success: the bad times are over. But if I had had the misfortune to lose courage, if I had allowed myself to be defeated, if I hadn't stood in the breach, all I would have to do was throw my desk out of the window, change my name. , and to learn a trade.

All because I had hidden the existence of Vittoria Savorelli !

I made up my mind to seek a judgment from the Society of Men of Letters. I wrote to the president:

“I aspire to the honor of being one of you; the books I have written are nothing; but I have been brutally slandered: here is my most serious title of your choice. The Committee of Men of Letters, on an eloquent report from the bibliophile Jacob, received me unanimously.

During these debates, Tolla was reproduced by all the major departmental newspapers and by Indépendance belge , counterfeited in Berlin, translated into German, Danish, Swedish and English. No journalist, no editor, no translator dared to publish Vittoria Savorelli . I proposed to two great newspapers to do a translation for them: they sent me away a long way.

The tumult subsided, the newspapers and reviews judged me in cold blood. The first word was said by the Belgian Independence  : “There is nothing to whip a spade. The last by l' Illustration  : "  Much ado about nothing , much ado about nothing. " In the meantime, the Revue de Genève , the Grande Revue de Westminster , the Gazette d'Augsbourg , the Leader , the Emancipation Belge , etc., had declared themselves in my favour: I had enough to console myself. .

I know that I still have a few unbelievers to convince and that the paternity of this novel will be acquired when I have written others. I get up in the morning, and I write a little every day to prove that I am not a plagiarist, and to deserve your friendship, dear reader.

TOLA.

The Feraldi family is not princely, but it walks hand in hand with many princes. Alexandre Feraldi, count of the Holy Empire, baron of Vignano, knight of the order of Constantine, is one of the sixty patricians registered on the tables of the Capitol. He never wanted to join the papal army, where his father was a lieutenant colonel. Delicate health, the serious instruction he received at the college of Nazareth, and, above all, the necessity of restoring the affairs of his family, made him embrace the study of laws and jurisprudence. The time is past when one found in every Roman the stuff of a soldier, a plowman, and a jurisconsult; but the patricians have retained respect for the three glorious arts which made their ancestors great. Count Feraldi, without exception, married in 1816 to Catherine Mariani, daughter of the Marquis of Grotta Ferrata. About the same time, two of his first cousins, of the same name as him, married princesses, an Odescalchi and a Barberini. Alexandre Feraldi was not insensitive to the honor of these alliances, which raised the name of his family. Three months later, an unhoped-for succession, which happened to surprise him during the pregnancy of his wife, placed him forever above want, raising his income to twenty-five or thirty thousand francs. No man was happier than Count Feraldi in the first year of his marriage. This amiable little man, lively and bouncy, very dark, without his countenance showing anything black; very fine and very subtle, with a lot of frankness and open-heartedness, filled with his joy and animated with his gaiety the dilapidated palace of his ancestors. His wife, quite beautiful, but of a dry and, so to speak, destitute beauty, loved him madly. His friends sometimes joked about the excess of his happiness. “Where will the fortunes of the Feraldis end,” they said emphatically? The Pactolus runs in their garden; the offspring of princely families come to be grafted onto their genealogical tree. We predict to you, O too happy Alexander, that your wife will give birth to a pope within two months! » the fortune of the Feraldis?

On September 1 , 1816, the Countess gave birth to a daughter who was baptized under the name of Vittoria. A year later Vittoria had a brother named Victor. The triumphant little Count Alexander had not found more modest names for his children.

It was nice to hear her ask if her son Victor had taken the breast, and her daughter Vittoria had eaten her porridge. The Countess and the people of the house simply called the little boy Toto and the little Tolla.

The Feraldi Palace is located in one of the most noble districts of Rome, a stone's throw from the French Embassy. It is neither very large nor very beautiful: it has neither the original dilapidation of the palace of Venice, nor the immensity of the Doria palace, nor the majesty of the Farnese palace; but he has a garden. Tolla was raised among trees and flowers. A wide alley, sheltered from the north wind by a wall of cypresses, was his winter promenade. When she was seven or eight months old, she met an old flowering lemon tree who became her best friend. She held out her little arms towards him; with beautiful hands she tore off the long flowers and the big purplish buds, and she carried them to her mouth. The doctor of the house, Doctor Ély, allowed that from the first days of April she was kept for an hour or two in the garden, stretched out freely on a carpet, in the shade of her lemon tree, or under a holm oak, another venerable friend. When summer came, she took her first baths in the garden, in water that the sun had taken care to heat. Freedom, movement, the open air and the generous scents exhaled from the trees, all combined to strengthen this young body: Tolla grew with the plants that surrounded him, effortlessly and painlessly. A walk in the garden put him to sleep in a few minutes; on waking she smiled at life, at her parents and at her garden. The work of the first teeth, so dreaded by mothers, took place in her without anyone noticing it, and one fine morning the countess, who was feeding her,

Every year, in the month of August, the Count sailed for Capri, where he owned a fine vineyard. While he watched his harvest, the Countess went to live in Lariccia, in the fresh air, in a pretty villa where, in living memory, no one had caught a fever. Her husband would soon join her there. They stayed there with their children until the cold weather, and never returned to Rome until they saw the olives being picked.

Tolla spent the happiest days of his childhood in Lariccia. She was more free there than at Rome, although she had been placed under the high hand of little Menico, the son of a farmer of her father's. Menico, that is to say Dominique, was five years older than Tolla and six years older than Toto, but he never abused the authority given to him by his age and the countess's confidence. He could refuse nothing to Tolla. In spite of all the warnings of prudence and abstinence that had not been spared him, he himself hoisted his little pupil on all the donkeys in the village, and he marauded for her in the best enclosed gardens. More than once we surprised the mentor bursting out laughing at the sight of Tolla who was biting with great teeth a heavy bunch of yellow grapes, or who smeared his cheeks with a big purple fig. The gardens, the woods, the donkeys and Menico were for twelve years the only tutors of Tolla. His mother taught him some religion and music. As she was never forced to sit at the piano, she always came willingly. Her little fingers liked to run over the ivory keys. It turned out that she had the right ear, and even, which is rarer in children, the feeling of measure. The famous maestro Terziani, who heard him one day by chance, declared that it was a great pity not to give him a master, but they let him speak.

The famous maestro Terziani, who heard him one day by chance, declared that it was a great pity not to give him a master, but they let him speak.Religion, and above all that splendid Catholicism which reigns in Rome, found in her a soul well prepared. The pomp of ceremonies, the perfumes of incense, gold, marble, sacred music, drew her invincibly, like the flowering lemon tree to which she stretched out her arms. His greedy imagination seized upon the first food offered to him. She fell in love with a filial passion for the Madonna, this lady dressed in blue and gold who was said to be so good to her and whom she saw as so beautiful. The childish enthusiasm she conceived for certain images changed little by little into devotion. By dint of praying in her mother's room in front of a Holy Familyof Sassoferrato, she had a special bond with Saint Joseph: she sent him kisses, as to an old and respectable relative of the house. "You'll see," she said to him, "how I'll kiss you if I go to heaven!" This loving soul did not need to learn charity. At four years old, she tore her clothes, because she had noticed that they were given to the little poor when they were torn. She crumbled her lunch to the birds in the garden. “Are they not our neighbour? she said. I feed my winged brothers. His charity extended even to the dead. One day, her mother took her to the Jesuit church, where they were preaching for the souls in purgatory. It was in the octave of Saint-Ignatius, about a month before she had completed her sixth year. Throughout the sermon, Toto had eyes only for the colossal solid silver statue resting on a lapis lazuli globe; he asked his mother several times if the good Lord was as rich as Saint Ignatius, and if he had such a beautiful statue anywhere in the world. Tolla listened to the preacher. When the first beggar passed by her, she threw into the purse a small coin which her mother had given her for this purpose; but when they came to beg before her for the second time, as she had no more money, she quickly untied her little coral bracelet and gave it to the souls in purgatory. We only noticed it in the evening when we undressed her. he asked his mother several times if the good Lord was as rich as Saint Ignatius, and if he had such a beautiful statue somewhere in the world.

“You shouldn't have given away your bracelet without my permission,” his mother told him. »

She replied sharply:

"Haven't you heard, mother, how thirsty these poor souls are?" »

At thirteen, Tolla could read and write, ride horses, climb trees, jump ditches, play the piano, love his parents and pray to God. Her father noticed that with her little talents, her perfect ignorance and her great qualities, she did not look badly like a flowering hawthorn bush. We decided to put her in boarding school. The establishment in vogue at that time was the Royal Institute of Marie-Louise at Lucca. Pupils flocked there from the depths of Italy and even from overseas and across the mountains. The rumor of the annual competitions held there and of the prizes awarded there resounded throughout the peninsula, from Naples to Venice. Count Feraldi hoped that the love of glory would awaken in his daughter a taste for work, and that the lure of these coveted crowns would make him regain lost time. He took her to the superintendent of the royal institute, Countess Trebiliani.

Tolla, thrown without transition into the regular and almost monastic habits of a large community, had no time to regret her freedom, her family, and the woods of Lariccia. She fell in love with studying with a sudden passion, but one in which curiosity had more of a role than emulation. She cared little to appear learned, but she conceived an incredible desire to know. All the serious faculties of her mind, suddenly awakened, began to work, and it seemed to be recognized that the idleness in which she had lived had increased her strength a hundredfold. His mind resembled those uncultivated lands of the new world which only await a handful of seed to reveal their inexhaustible fecundity. Ignorant as she was, everything seemed new to her, everything piqued her curiosity; she disdained nothing, nothing seemed worn out or banal to her. The most insipid stories, the most nauseating summaries had as much attraction for her as novels. Geography seemed to her a curious and endearing science: leafing through an atlas, she experienced the emotions of a traveler who discovers the Americas at every step. To tell the truth, in a word, nothing put her off, not even arithmetic; she was charmed by these little dry and precise reasonings; it captures at first glance how ingenious they are in their simplicity, and I don't know if there has been anyone since Pythagoras to whom the Pythagorean table has given so much pleasure. attractions than novels.
