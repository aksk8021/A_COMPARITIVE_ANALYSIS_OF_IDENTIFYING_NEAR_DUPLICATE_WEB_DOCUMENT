Electrical supply from transmitted water-power is now distributed in more than fifty cities of North America. These include Mexico City, with a population of 402,000; Buffalo and San Francisco, with 352,387 and 342,782 respectively; Montreal, with 266,826, and Los Angeles, St. Paul, and Minneapolis, with populations that range between 100,000 and 200,000 each. North and south these cities extend from Quebec to Anderson, and from Seattle to Mexico City. East and west the chain of cities includes Portland, Springfield, Albany, Buffalo, Hamilton, Toronto, St. Paul, Butte, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco. To reach these cities the water-power is electrically transmitted, in many cases dozens, in a number of cases scores, and in one case more than two hundred miles. In the East, Canada is the site of the longest transmission, that from Shawinigan Falls to Montreal, a distance of eighty-five miles.

From Spier Falls to Albany the electric line is forty miles in length. Hamilton is thirty-seven miles from that point on the Niagara escarpment, where its electric power is developed. Between St. Paul and its electric water-power station, on Apple River, the transmission line is twenty-five miles long. The falls of the Missouri River at Cañon Ferry are the source of the electrical energy distributed in Butte, sixty-five miles away. Los Angeles draws electrical energy from a plant eighty-three miles distant on the Santa Ana River. From Colgate power-house, on the Yuba, to San Francisco, by way of Mission San José, the transmission line has a length of 220 miles. Between Electra generating station in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and San Francisco is 154 miles by the electric line.

These transmissions involve large powers as well as long distances. The new plant on the Androscoggin is designed to deliver 10,000 horse-power[2]
[3] for electrical supply in Lewiston, Me. At Spier Falls, on the Hudson, whence energy goes to Albany and other cities, the electric generators will have a capacity of 32,000 horse-power. From the two water-power stations at Niagara Falls, with their twenty-one electric generators of 5,000 horse-power each, a total of 105,000, more than 30,000 horse-power is regularly transmitted to Buffalo alone; the greater part of the capacity being devoted to local industries. Electrical supply in St. Paul is drawn from a water-power plant of 4,000 and in Minneapolis from a like plant of 7,400 horse-power capacity. The Cañon Ferry station, on the Missouri, that supplies electrical energy in both Helena and Butte, has a capacity of 10,000 horse-power. Both Seattle and Tacoma draw electrical supply from the 8,000 horse-power plant at Snoqualmie Falls. The Colgate power-house, which develops energy for San Francisco and a number of smaller places, has electric generators of 15,000 horse-power aggregate capacity. At the Electra generating station, where energy is also transmitted to San Francisco and other cities on the way, the capacity is 13,330 horse-power. Electrical supply in Los Angeles is drawn from the generating station of 4,000 horse-power, on the Santa Ana River, and from two stations, on Mill Creek, with an aggregate of 4,600, making a total capacity of not less than 8,600 horse-power. Five water-power stations, scattered within a radius of ten miles and with 4,200 horse-power total capacity, are the source of electrical supply in Mexico City.

The foregoing are simply a part of the more striking illustrations of that development by which falling water is generating hundreds of thousands of horse-power for electrical supply to millions of population. This application of great water powers to the industrial wants of distant cities is hardly more than a decade old. Ten years ago Shawinigan Falls was an almost unheard-of point in the wilds of Canada. Spier Falls was merely a place of scenic interest; the Missouri at Cañon Ferry was not lighting a lamp or displacing a pound of coal; that falling water in the Sierra Nevada Mountains should light the streets and operate electric cars in San Francisco seemed impossible, and that diversion of Niagara, which seems destined to develop more than a million horse-power and leave dry the precipices over which the waters now plunge, had not yet begun. In some few instances where water-power was located in towns or cities, it has been applied to electrical supply since the early days of the industry. In the main, however, the supply of electrical energy from water-power has been made possible only by long-distance transmission. The extending radius of electrical transmission for water-powers has formed[4]
[5] the greatest incentive to their development. This development in turn has reacted on the conditions that limit electrical supply and has materially extended the field of its application. Transmitted water-power has reduced the rates for electric service. It may not be easy to prove this reduction by quoting figures for net rates, because these are not generally published, but there are other means of reaching the conclusion.

In the field of illumination electricity competes directly with gas, and in the field of motive power with coal. During the past decade it is well known that the price of gas has materially declined and the price of coal, barring the recent strike period, has certainly not increased. In spite of these reductions electrical supply from water-power has displaced both gas and coal in many instances.

Moreover, the expansion of electric water-power systems has been decidedly greater, as a rule, than that of electrical supply from steam-driven stations. An example of the fact last stated may be seen in Portland, Me. In the spring of 1899, a company was formed to transmit and distribute electrical energy in that city from a water-power about thirteen miles distant. For some years, prior to and since the date just named, an extensive electric system with steam-power equipment has existed in Portland. In spite of this, the system using water-power, on January 1st, 1903, had a connected load of 352 enclosed arcs and 20,000 incandescent lamps, besides 835 horse-power in motors.

Comparing the expansion of electric water-power systems with those operated by steam, when located in different cities, Hartford and Springfield may be taken on the one hand and Fall River and New Bedford on the other. The use of water-power in electrical supply at Hartford began in November, 1891, and has since continued to an increasing extent. Throughout the same period electrical supply in Fall River has been derived exclusively from steam. In 1890 the population of Hartford was 53,230, and in 1900 it stood at 79,850, an increase of 50 per cent. At the beginning of the decade Fall River had a population of 74,398, and at its close the figures were 104,863, a rise of 40.9 per cent. In 1892 the connected load of the electric supply system at Fall River included 451 arc and 7,800 incandescent lamps, and motors aggregating 140 horse-power. By 1901 this load had increased to 1,111 arcs, 24,254 incandescent lamps, and 600 horse-power in motors. The electric supply system at Hartford in 1892 was serving 800 arcs, 2,000 incandescent lamps, and no motors. After the use of transmitted water-power during nine years the connected load of the Hartford system had come to include 1,679 arcs, 68,725 incandescent lamps, and 3,476 horse-power of motor capacity[6] in 1901. At the beginning of the decade Hartford was far behind Fall River in both incandescent lamps and motors, but at the end Hartford had nearly three times as many incandescent lamps and nearly six times as great a capacity in connected motors. As Fall River had a population in 1900 that was greater by thirty-one per cent. than the population of Hartford, and the percentage of increase during the decade was only 9.1 lower in the former city, water-power seems to have been the most potent factor in the rise of electric loads in the latter. Electric gains at Hartford could not have been due to the absence of competition by gas, for the price of gas there in 1901 was $1 per 1,000 cubic feet, while the price in Fall River was $1.10 for an equal amount.

Water-power began to be used in electrical supply at Springfield during the latter half of 1897. In that year the connected load of the Springfield electric system included 1,006 arcs, 24,778 incandescent lamps, and motors with a capacity of 647 horse-power. Five years later, in 1902, this connected load had risen to 1,399 arc lamps, 45,735 incandescent lamps, and a capacity of 1,025 horse-power in electric motors. At New Bedford, in 1897, the electric system was supplying 406 arc and 22,122 incandescent lamps besides motors rated at 298 horse-power. This load, in 1902, had changed to 488 arcs, 18,055 incandescent lamps, and 432 horse-power in capacity of electric motors. From the foregoing figures it appears that while 82 arc lamps were added in New Bedford, 393 such lamps were added in Springfield. While the electric load at New Bedford was increased by 134 horse-power of motors, the like increase at Springfield was 378 horse-power, and while the former city lost 4,067 from its load of incandescent lamps, the latter gained 20,957 of these lamps. During all these changes electrical supply in Springfield has come mostly from water-power, and that in New Bedford has been the product of steam. Population at Springfield numbered 44,179 in 1890 and 62,059 in 1900, an increase of 40.5 per cent. In the earlier of these years New Bedford had a population of 40,733, and in the later 62,442, an increase of 53.3 per cent. In 1902 the average price obtained for gas at Springfield was $1.04 and at New Bedford $1.18 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Springfield contains a prosperous gas system, and the gross income there from the sale of gas was thirty-one per cent greater in 1902 than in 1897. During this same period of five years the gross income from sales of electrical energy, developed in large part by water-power, increased forty-seven per cent. For the five years of general depression, ending in 1897 gross annual income of gas sales in Springfield rose[7] only five per cent, and the like electric income nine per cent. In the five years last named the electrical supply system was operated with coal.

The application of transmitted water-power in electrical supply has displaced steam as a motive power in many large industrial plants that never would have been operated from steam-driven electric stations. An example of this sort exists at Portland, where one of the motors operated by the electric water-power system, in an industrial plant, has a capacity of 300 horse-power. Every pound of coal burned in Concord, N. H., is hauled by the single steam railway system entering that city, which railway operates large car and repair shops there. Some years ago the railway installed a complete plant of engines, dynamos, and motors for electric-driving throughout these shops. These engines and dynamos now stand idle and the motor equipment, with an aggregate capacity of 590 horse-power, is operated with energy purchased from the local electrical supply system and drawn from water-power.

Another striking example of the ability of electric water-power systems to make power rates that are attractive to large manufacturers may be seen at Manchester, N. H. One of the largest manufacturing plants in that city purchases energy for the operation of the equivalent of more than 7,000 incandescent lamps, and of motors rated at 976 horse-power, from the electrical supply system there, whose generating stations are driven mainly by water-power. The Manchester electrical supply system also furnishes energy, through a sub-station of 800-horse-power capacity, to operate an electric railway connecting Manchester and Concord. This electric line is owned and operated in common with the only steam railway system of New Hampshire, so that the only inducement to purchase energy from the water-power system seems to be one of price.

In Buffalo the electric transmission system from Niagara Falls supplies large motors of about 20,000 horse-power capacity in manufacturing and industrial works, and 7,000 horse-power to the street railway system, besides another 4,000 horse-power for general service in lighting and small motors. Few large cities in the United States have cheaper coal than Buffalo, and in Portland, Concord, and Manchester coal prices are moderate. In the Rocky Mountain region, where coal is more expensive, the greater part of the loads of some electric water-power systems is made up of large industrial works. In Salt Lake City the electrical supply system, which draws its energy almost exclusively from water-powers, had a connected load of motors aggregating 2,600 horse-power as far back as 1901, and also furnished energy to operate the local electric railway, and several smelters six miles south of the city, besides[8] all the local lighting service. As good lump coal sells in Salt Lake for $4.50 per ton, slack at less than one-half this figure, and the population there by the late census was only 53,531, the figures for the load of motors are especially notable. At Helena energy from the 10,000 horse-power station at Cañon Ferry operates the local lighting and power systems, two smelting and a mining plant.

[A] Power received.
In Butte, energy from the station just named operates the works of five smelting and mining companies, driving motors that range from 1 to 800 horse-power in individual capacity. The capacity of the Butte sub-station is 7,600 horse-power.

The great electric water power system marked by the Santa Ana station at one end and the city of Los Angeles at the other, eighty-three miles distant, includes more than 160 miles of transmission lines, several hundred miles of distribution circuits, and supplies light and power in twelve cities and towns. Among the customers of this system are an electric railway, a number of irrigation plants, and a cement works. These[9] works contain motors that range from 10 to 200 horse-power each in capacity. Motors of fifty horse-power or less are used at pumping stations in the irrigation systems.

Applications of water-power in electrical supply during the past decade have prepared the way for a much greater movement in this direction. Work is now under way for the electric transmission of water-power, either for the first time or in larger amounts, to Albany, Toronto, Chicago, Duluth, Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and dozens of other cities that might be named.

Another ten years will see the greater part of electrical supply on the American continent drawn from water-power.

Only the largest city supplied from each water-power is named above. Thus the same transmission system enters Albany, Troy, Schenectady, Saratoga, and a number of smaller places.

CHAPTER II.
UTILITY OF WATER-POWER IN ELECTRICAL SUPPLY.
In comparatively few systems is the available water-power sufficient to carry the entire load at all hours of the day, and during all months of the year, so that the question of how much fuel can be saved is an uncertain one for many plants. Again, the development of water-power often involves a large investment, and may bring a burden of fixed charges greater than the value of the fuel saved.

In spite of these conflicting opinions and factors, the application of water-power in electrical systems is now going on faster than ever before. If a saving of fuel, measured by the available flow of water during those hours when it can be devoted directly to electrical supply, were its only advantage, the number of cases in which this power could be utilized at a profit would be relatively small. If, on the other hand, all of the water that passes down a stream could be made to do electrical work, and if the utilization of this water had other advantages nearly or quite as great as the reduction of expense for coal, then many water-powers would await only development to bring profit to their owners.

No part of the problem is more uncertain than the first cost and subsequent fixed charges connected with the development of water-power. To bring out the real conditions, the detailed facts as to one or more plants may be of greater value than mere general statements covering a wide range of cases.

On a certain small river the entire water privilege at a point where a fall of fourteen feet could be made available was obtained several years ago. At this point a substantial stone and concrete dam was built, and also a stone and brick power-house with concrete floor and steel truss roof. In this power-house were installed electric generators of 800 kilowatts total capacity, direct-connected to horizontal turbine wheels. The entire cost of the real estate necessary to secure the water-power privilege plus the cost of all the improvements was about $130,000. More than enough water-power to drive the 800-kilowatt generators at full load was estimated to be available, except at times of exceptionally low water. At this plant the investment for the water-power site, development, and[11] complete equipment was thus $162 per kilowatt capacity of generators installed.

Allowing 65 days of low water, these generators of 800 kilowatts capacity may be operated 300 days per year. If the running time averages ten hours daily at full load, the energy delivered per year is 2,400,000 kilowatt hours. Ten per cent of the total investment should be ample to cover interest and depreciation charges, and this amounts to $13,000 yearly. It follows that the items of interest and depreciation on the original investment represent a charge of 0.54 cent per kilowatt hour on the assumed energy output at this plant. This energy is transmitted a few miles and used in the electrical supply system of a large city.

On another river the entire water privilege was secured about four years ago at a point where a fall of more than 20 feet between ledges of rock could be obtained and more than 2,000 horse-power could be developed. At this point a masonry dam and brick power-house were built, and horizontal turbine wheels were installed, direct-connected to electric generators of 1,500 kilowatts total capacity. The entire cost of real estate, water rights, dam, building, and equipment in this case was about $250,000.

Assuming, as before, that generators may be operated at full capacity for 10 hours per day during 300 days per year, the energy delivered by this plant amounts to 4,500,000 kilowatt hours yearly. The allowance of 10 per cent on the entire investment for interest and depreciation is represented by $25,000 yearly in this case, or 0.56 cent per kilowatt hour of probable output. Energy from this plant is transmitted and used in a large system of electrical supply.

If, through lack of water or inability to store water or energy at times when it is not wanted, generators cannot be operated at full capacity during the average number of hours assumed above, the item of interest and depreciation per unit of delivered energy must be higher than that computed. With the possible figure for this item at less than six-tenths of a cent per kilowatt hour, there is opportunity for some increase before it becomes prohibitive. At the plant last named the entire investment amounted to $166 per kilowatt capacity of connected generators, compared with $162 in the former case, and these figures may be taken as fairly representative for the development of water-power in a first-class manner on small rivers, under favorable conditions. In both of these instances the power-houses are quite close to the dams. If long canals or pipe lines must be built to convey the water, the expense of development may be greatly increased.

[12]

One advantage of water- over steam-power is the smaller cost of the building with the former for a given capacity of plant. The building for direct-connected electric generators, driven by water-wheels, is relatively small and simple. Space for fuel, boilers, economizers, feed-water heaters, condensers, steam piping, and pumps is not required where water-power is used. No chimney or apparatus for mechanical draught is needed.

The model electric station operated by water-power usually consists of a single room with no basement under it. One such station has floor dimensions 27 by 52 feet, giving an area of 1,404 square feet, and contains generators of 800 kilowatts capacity. This gives 1.75 square feet of floor space per kilowatt of generators. In this station there is ample room for all purposes, including erection or removal of machinery.

Next to the saving of fuel, the greatest advantage of water-power is due to the relatively small requirements for labor at generating stations where it is used. This is well illustrated by an example from actual practice. In a modern water-power station that contributes to electrical supply in a large city the generator capacity is 1,200 kilowatts. All of the labor connected with the operation of this station during nearly twenty-four hours per day is done by two attendants working alternate shifts.

These attendants live close to the station in a house owned by the electric company, and receive $60 each per month in addition to house rent. Considering the location, $12 per month is probably ample allowance for the rent. This brings the total expense of operation at this station for labor up to $132 per month, or $1,584 per year, a sum corresponding to $1.32 yearly per kilowatt of generator capacity.

At steam-power stations of about the above capacity, operating twenty-four hours daily, $6 is an approximate yearly cost of labor per kilowatt of generators in use. It thus appears that water-power plants may be operated at less than one-fourth of the labor expense necessary at steam stations per unit of capacity. On an average, the combined cost of fuel and labor at electric stations driven by steam-power is a little more than 76 per cent of their total cost of operation. Of this total, labor represents about 28, and fuel about 48 per cent. Water-power, by dispensing with fuel and with three-fourths of the labor charge, reduces the expense of operation at electric stations by fully 69 per cent.

But this great saving in the operating expenses of electric stations can be made only where water entirely displaces coal. If part water-power and part coal are used, the result depends on the proportion of each, and[13] is obviously much affected by the variations of water-power capacity. In such a mixed system the saving effected by water-power must also depend on the extent to which its energy can be absorbed at all hours the day. By far the greater number of electric stations using water-power are obliged also to employ steam during either some months in the year or some hours in the day, or both.


ENERGY CURVES FROM WATER POWER ELECTRIC STATIONS.
Fig. 3.

It is highly important, therefore, to determine, as nearly as may be, the answers to three questions:

[14]

First, what variations are to be expected in the capacity of a water-power during the several months of a year?

Second, if the daily flow of water is equal in capacity to the daily output of electrical energy, how far can the water-power be devoted to the development of that energy?

Third, with a water-power sufficient to carry all electrical loads at times of moderately high water, what percentage of the yearly output of energy in a general supply system can be derived from the water?

To the first of these questions experience alone can furnish an answer. Variations in the discharge of rivers during the different months of a year are very great. In a plant laid out with good engineering skill some provision will be made for the storage of water, and the capacity of generating equipment will correspond to some point between the highest and lowest rates of discharge.

Curve No. 1 in the diagram on the opposite page represents the energy output at an electric station driven entirely by water-power from a small stream during the twelve months of 1901, the entire flow of the stream being utilized. During December, 1901, the output of this station was 527,700 kilowatts, and was greater than that in any other month of the year. Taking this output at 100 per cent, the curve is platted to show the percentage attained by the delivered energy in each of the other months. At the lowest point on the curve, corresponding to the month of February, the output of energy was only slightly over 33 per cent of that in December. During nine other months of the year the proportion of energy output to that in December was over 60 and in three months over 80 per cent. For the twelve months the average delivery of energy per month was 73.7 per cent of that during December.

At a somewhat small water-power station on another river with a watershed less precipitous than that of the stream just considered, the following results were obtained during the twelve months ending June 30th, 1900. For this plant the largest monthly output of energy was in November, and this output is taken at 100 per cent. The smallest delivery of energy was in October, when the percentage was 53.1 of the amount for November. In each of seven other months of the year the output of energy was above 80 per cent of that in November. During[15] March, April, May, and June the water-power yielded all of the energy required in the electrical supply system with which it was connected, and could, no doubt, have done more work if necessary. For the twelve months the average delivery of energy per month was 80.6 per cent of that in November, the month of greatest output.

The gentler slopes and better storage facilities of this second river show their effect in an average monthly delivery of energy 6.9 per cent higher as to the output in a month when it was greatest than the like percentage for the water-power first considered. These two water-power illustrate what can be done with only very moderate storage capacities on the rivers involved. At both stations much water escapes over the dams during several months of each year. With enough storage space to retain all waters of these rivers until wanted the energy outputs could be largely increased.

As may be seen by inspection of curve No. 2, the second water-power has smaller fluctuations of capacity, as well as a higher average percentage of the maximum output than the water-power illustrated by curve No. 1.

If the discharge of a stream during each twenty-four hours is just sufficient to develop the electrical energy required in a supply system during that time, the water may be made to do all of the electrical work in one of two ways. If the water-power has enough storage capacity behind it to hold the excess of water during some hours of the day, then it is only necessary to install enough water-wheels and electric generators to carry the maximum load. Should the storage capacity for water be lacking, or the equipment of generating apparatus be insufficient to work at the maximum rate demanded by the electrical system, then an electric storage battery must be employed if all of the water is to be utilized and made to do the electrical work.

The greatest fluctuations between maximum and minimum daily loads at electric lighting stations usually occur in December and January. The extent of these fluctuations is illustrated by curve No. 3, which represents the total load on a large electrical supply system during a typical week-day of January, 1901. On this day the maximum load was 2,720 and the minimum load 612 kilowatts, or 22.5 per cent of the highest rate[16] of output. During the day in question the total delivery of energy for the twenty-four hours was 30,249 kilowatt hours, so that the average load per hour was 1,260 kilowatts. This average is 46 per cent of the maximum load.

Computation of the area included by curve No. 3 above the average load line of 1,260 kilowatts shows that about 17.8 per cent of the total output of energy for the day was delivered above the average load, that is, in addition to an output at average load. It further appears by inspection of this load curve that this delivery of energy above the average load line took place during 12.3 hours of the day, so that its average rate of delivery per hour was 438 kilowatts.

If a water-power competent to carry a load of 1,260 kilowatts twenty-four hours per day be applied to the system illustrated by curve No. 3, then about 17.8 per cent of the energy of the water for the entire day must be stored during 11.7 hours and liberated in the remaining 12.3 hours. This percentage of the total daily energy of the water amounts to 36 per cent of its energy during the hours that storage takes place.

If all of the storage is done with water, the electric generators must be able to work at the rate of 2,720 kilowatts, the maximum load. If all of the storage is done in electric batteries, the use of water may be uniform throughout the day, and the generator capacity must be enough above 1,260 kilowatts to make up for losses in the batteries. Where batteries are employed the amount of water will be somewhat greater than that necessary to operate the load directly with generators, because of the battery losses.

In spite of the large fluctuations of electrical loads throughout each twenty-four hours, it is thus comparatively easy to operate them with water-powers that are little, if any, above the requirements of the average loads.

Perhaps the most important question relating to the use of water-power in electrical supply is what percentage of the yearly output of energy can be derived from water where this power is sufficient to carry the entire load during a part of the year. With storage area for all surplus water in any season, the amount of work that could be done by a stream might be calculated directly from the records of its annual discharge of water. As such storage areas for surplus water have seldom, or never, been made available in connection with electrical systems, the best assurance as to the percentage of yearly output that may be derived from water-power is found in the experience of existing plants.

The question now to be considered differs materially from that involving[17] merely the variations of water-power in the several months, or even the possible yearly output from water-power. The ratio of output from water-power to the total yearly output of an electrical system includes the result of load fluctuations in every twenty-four hours and the variable demands for electrical energy in different months, as well as changes in the amount of water-power available through the seasons.

In order to show the combined result of these three important factors curve No. 4 has been constructed. This indicates the percentages of total semi-yearly outputs of electrical energy derived from water-power in two supply systems. Each half-year extends either from January to June, inclusive, or from July to December, inclusive, and thus covers a wet and dry season. Each half-year also includes a period of maximum and one of minimum demand for electrical energy in lighting. The period of largest water supply usually nearly coincides with that of heaviest lighting load, but this is not always true.

Electrical systems have purposely been selected in which the water-power in at least one month of each half-year was nearly or quite sufficient to carry the entire electrical load. The percentage of energy from water-power to the total energy delivered by the system is presented for each of five half-years. Three of the half-years each run from July to December, and two extend from January to June, respectively. The half years that show percentages of 66.8, 80.2, and 95.6, respectively, for the relation of energy from water-power to the total electrical output relate to one system, and the half years that show percentages of 81.97 and 94.3 for the energy from water-power relate to another system.

For the half-year when 66.8 per cent. of the output of the electrical system was derived from water-power, the total output of the system was 3,966,026 kilowatt hours. During the month of December in this half-year more than 98 per cent of the electrical energy delivered by the system was from water-power, though the average for the six months was only 66.8 per cent from water.

In the following six months, from January to June, the electrical supply system delivered 4,161,754 kilowatt hours, and of this amount the water-power furnished 80.2 per cent. For the six months just named, one month, May, saw 99 per cent of all the delivered energy derived from water-power.

The same system during the next half-year, from July to December, without any addition to its water-power development or equipment, got 95.6 per cent of its entire energy output from water-power, and this output amounted to 4,415,945 kilowatt hours. In one month of the half-year[18] just named only 0.2 per cent of the output was generated with steam-power.

These three successive half years illustrate the fluctuations of the ratio between water-power outputs and the demands for energy on a single system of electrical supply. The percentage of 81.9 for energy derived from water-power during the half-year from July to December represents the ratio of output from water to the total for an electrical supply system where water generated 94 per cent of all the energy delivered in one month.

In the same system during the following six months, with exactly the same water-power equipment, the percentage of output from water-power was 94.3 of the total kilowatt-hours delivered by the system. This result was reached in spite of the fact that the total outputs of the system in the two half-years were equal to within less than one per cent.

The lesson from the record of these five half-years is that comparatively large variations are to be expected in the percentage of energy developed by water-power to the total output of electrical supply systems in different half-years. But, in spite of these variations, the portion of electrical loads that may be carried by water-power is sufficient to warrant its rapidly extending application to lighting and power in cities and towns.

CHAPTER III.
COST OF CONDUCTORS FOR ELECTRIC-POWER TRANSMISSION.
Electrical transmission of energy involves problems quite distinct from its development. A great water-power, or a location where fuel is cheap, may offer opportunity to generate electrical energy at an exceptionally low cost. This energy may be used so close to the point of its development that the cost of transmission is too small for separate consideration.

An example of conditions where the important problems of transmission are absent exists in the numerous factories grouped about the great water-power plants at Niagara and drawing electrical energy from it. In such a case energy flows directly from the dynamos, driven by water-power, to the lamps, motors, chemical vats, and electric heaters of consumers through the medium, perhaps, of local transformers. Here the costs and losses of transmitting or distributing equipments are minor matters, compared with the development of the energy.

If, now, energy from the water-power is to be transmitted over a distance of many miles, a new set of costs is to be met. In the first place, it will be necessary to raise the voltage of the transmitted energy much above the pressure at the dynamos in order to save in the weight and cost of conductors for the transmission line. This increase of voltage requires transformers with capacity equal to the maximum rate at which energy is to be delivered to the line. These transformers will add to the cost of the energy that they deliver in two ways: by the absorption of some energy to form heat, and by the sum of annual interest, maintenance, and depreciation charges on the price paid for them. Other additions to the cost of energy delivered by the transmission line must be made to cover the annual interest, maintenance, and depreciation charges on the amount of the line investment, and to pay for the energy changed to heat in the line.

Near the points where the energy is to be used, the transmission line must end in transformers to reduce the voltage to a safe figure for local distribution. This second set of transformers will further add to the cost of the delivered energy in the same ways as the former set.

[20]

From these facts it is evident that, to warrant an electrical transmission, the value of energy at the point of distribution should at least equal the value at the generating plant plus the cost of the transmission. Knowing the cost of energy at one end of the transmission line and its value at the other, the difference between these two represents the maximum cost at which the transmission will pay.

Three main factors are concerned in the cost of electric power transmission, namely, the transformers, the pole line, and the wire or conductors. These factors enter into the cost of transmitted energy in very different degrees, according to the circumstances of each case. The maximum and average rates of energy transmission, the total voltage, the percentage of line loss, and the length of the line mainly determine the relative importance of the transformers, pole line, and conductors in the total cost of delivered energy.

First cost of transformers varies directly with the maximum rate of transmission, and is nearly independent of the voltage, the length of the transmission, and the percentage of line loss. A pole line changes in first cost with the length of the transmission, but is nearly independent of the other factors. Line conductors, for a fixed maximum percentage of loss, vary in first cost directly with the square of the length of the transmission and with the rate of the transmission; but their first cost decreases as the percentage of line loss increases and as the square of the voltage of transmission increases.

If a given amount of power is to be transmitted, at a certain percentage of loss in the line and at a fixed voltage, over distances of 50, 100, and 200 miles, respectively, the foregoing principles lead to the following conclusions: The capacity of transformers, being fixed by the rate of transmission, will be the same for either distance, and their cost is therefore constant. Transformer losses, interest, depreciation, and repairs are also constant. The cost of pole line, depending on its length, will be twice as great at 100 and four times as great at 200 as at 50 miles. Interest, depreciation, and repairs will also go up directly with the length of the pole lines.

Line conductors will cost four times as much for the 100- as for the 50-mile transmission, because their weight will be four times as great, and the annual interest and depreciation will go up at the same rate. For the transmission of 200 miles the cost of line conductors and their weight will be sixteen times as great as the cost at 50 miles. It follows that interest, depreciation, and maintenance will be increased sixteen times with the 200-mile transmission over what they were at 50 miles, if voltage and line loss are constant.

[21]

A concrete example of the cost of electric power transmission over a given distance will illustrate the practical application of these principles. Let the problem be to deliver electrical energy in a city distant 100 miles from the generating plant. Transformers with approximately twice the capacity corresponding to the maximum rate of transmission must be provided, because one set is required at the generating and another at the delivery station. The cost of these transformers will be approximately $7.50 per horse-power for any large capacity.

Reliability is of the utmost importance in a great power transmission, and this requires a pole line of the most substantial construction. Such a line in a locality where wooden poles can be had at a moderate price will cost, with conductors in position, about $700 per mile, exclusive of the cost of the conductors themselves or of the right of way but including the cost of erecting the conductors. The 100 miles of pole line in the present case should, therefore, be set down at a cost of $70,000.

A large delivery of power must be made to warrant the construction of so long and expensive a line, and 10,000 horse-power may be taken as the maximum rate of delivery. On the basis of two horse-power of transformer capacity for each horse-power of the maximum delivery rate, transformers with a capacity of 20,000 horse-power are necessary for the present transmission. At $7.50 per horse-power capacity, the first cost of these transformers is $150,000.

Before the weight and cost of line conductors can be determined, the voltage at which the transmission shall be carried out and the percentage of the energy to be lost in the conductors at periods of maximum load must be decided on. The voltage to be used is a matter of engineering judgment, based in large part on experience, and cannot be determined by calculation. In a transmission of 100 miles the cost of conductors is certain to be a very heavy item, and, as this cost decreases as the square of the voltage goes up, it is desirable to push the voltage as high as the requirements for reliable service permit.

A transmission line 142 miles long, from the mountains to Oakland, Cal., has been in constant and successful use for several years with 40,000 volts pressure. This line passes through wet as well as dry climate. It seems safer to conclude, therefore, that 40,000 volts may be used in most places with good results.

Having decided on the amount of power and the voltage and length of the transmission, the required weight of conductors will vary inversely as the percentage of energy lost as heat in the line. The best percentage[22] of loss depends on the number of factors, some of which, such as the cost of energy at the generating plant, are peculiar to each case.

As a provisional figure, based in part on the practice elsewhere, the loss on the line here considered may be taken at 10 per cent. when transmitting the full load of 10,000 horse-power. If the line is constructed on this basis the percentage of loss will be proportionately less for any smaller load. Thus, when the line is transmitting only 5,000 horse-power, the loss will amount to 5 per cent. During the greater portion of each day the demand for power is certain to be less than the maximum figure, so that a maximum loss of 10 per cent will correspond to an average loss on all the power delivered to the line of probably less than 7 per cent.

In order to deliver 10,000 horse-power by the transformers at a receiving station from a generating plant 100 miles distant where the pressure is 40,000 volts, the copper conductors must have a weight of about 1,500,000 pounds, if the loss of energy in them is 10 per cent of the energy delivered to the line. Taking these conductors at a medium price of 15 cents per pound, their cost amounts to $225,000.

The combined cost of the transformers, pole line, and line conductors, as now estimated, amounts to $445,000. No account is taken of the right-of-way for the pole line, because in many cases this would cost nothing, the public roads being used for the purpose; in other cases the cost might vary greatly with local conditions.

The efficiency of the transmission is measured by the ratio of the energy delivered by the transformers at the receiving station for local distribution to the energy delivered by the generating plant to the transformers that supply energy to the line for transmission. If worked at full capacity the large transformers here considered would have an efficiency of nearly 98 per cent; but as they must work, to some extent, on partial loads, the actual efficiency will hardly exceed 96 per cent.

The efficiency of the line conductors rises on partial loads, and may be safely taken at 93 per cent for all of the energy transmitted, though it is only 90 per cent on the maximum load. The combined efficiencies of the two sets of transformers and the line give the efficiency of the transmission, which equals the product of 0.96 × 0.93 × 0.96, or almost exactly 85.7 per cent. In other words, the transformers at the water-power station absorb 1.17 times as much energy as the transformers at the receiving station deliver to distribution lines in the place of use.

Interest, maintenance, and depreciation of this complete transmission system are sufficiently provided for by an allowance of 15 per cent[23] yearly on its entire first cost. As the total first cost of the transmission system was found to be $445,000, the annual expense of interest, depreciation, and repairs at 15 per cent of this sum amounts to $66,750.
