There was, about the year 1663, a few hundred paces from Saint-Omer, a pretty well-built house, the door of which opened onto the high road to Paris. A quickset hedge of hawthorn and elderberry surrounded a garden where you could see flowers, goats and children pell-mell. Half a dozen hens with their chicks cackled in a corner between the cabbages and strawberries; two or three hives, grouped under peach trees, turned their fragrant cones towards the sun, all buzzing with bees, and here and there, on the branches of big pear trees laden with fruit, cooed some handsome woodpigeon flapping his wing around of his companion.

The little house had a fresh and smiling aspect which rejoiced the heart; Virginia creeper and hops lined its walls; seven or eight irregularly pierced windows, all wide open to the south, seemed to gaze kindly upon the countryside; a thin wisp of smoke quivered at the end of the chimney, from which hung the flexible stems of the pellitory, and at whatever hour of the day you passed in front of the cottage, you could hear the joyous cries of children mingled with the crowing of the cock. Among these children who came there from all corners of the faubourg, there were three who belonged to Guillaume Grinedal, the master of the house: Jacques, Claudine and Pierre.

Guillaume Grinedal, or Father Guillaume, as he was familiarly called, was indeed the best falconer there was in all of Artois; but for a long time already he had hardly had the opportunity to exercise his knowledge. During the regency of Queen Anne of Austria, the lord of Assonville, her master, ruined by the wars, had been forced to sell his lands; but, before leaving the country, wishing to reward the fidelity of his old servant, he had made him a present of the cottage and the garden. Old Grinedal, refusing to serve new masters, had retired to this habitation, where he lived on the produce of some work and his savings. Having become a widower, Father Guillaume thought only of his children, he bred as well as his means permitted, and with the greatest honesty in the world. As long as they were small, children lived as free as butterflies, rolling on the grass in the summer, skating on the ice in the winter, and running bareheaded in the sun, in the rain or in the wind. Then came the time for studies, which consisted of reading in a large book on the knees of the good man Grinedal, and writing on a slate, which did not prevent one from still finding the leisure to pick strawberries in the woods and crayfish in streams.

Jacques, the eldest of the family, was, at seventeen or eighteen, a big boy who looked over twenty. He was not a smooth talker, but he acted with extreme boldness and resolution as soon as he thought he was within his rights. His strength made him feared by all the schoolboys of the faubourg and the suburbs, just as his righteousness made him loved. They willingly took him for judge in all children's quarrels; Jacques gave his stop, supported him if necessary with a few good punches, and everyone went away happy. When there was a quarrel and battles over cherries or some German top, as soon as Jacques was seen arriving, the loudest fell silent and the weakest straightened up; Jacques pushed aside the combatants,

He sometimes happened to speak to someone bigger and stronger than himself; but the fear of being beaten did not stop him. Ten times knocked down, he got up ten times; vanquished the day before, he began again the next day, and such was the empire of his courage supported by the feeling of justice innate in him, that he always ended up winning. But this determined little boy, who would not have backed down from ten king's gendarmes, became troubled and stammered in front of a little girl who could very well have been four years younger than him. The presence of Mademoiselle Suzanne de Malzonvilliers was enough to stop him in the middle of his most violent exercises. As soon as he saw her, he tumbled from the top of the poplars where he unearthed the magpies, let go of the arm of the he was correcting, or letting go of the bull he was wrestling with. All the young lady needed was an imperceptible sign of her finger, just a look, to make Jacques run to her side, flushed and confused.

Mademoiselle de Malzonvilliers' father was a wealthy trader who had taken advantage of the Fronde period to make his fortune, when so many others were ruined. He had not always been called by the brilliant name of Malzonvilliers, which was that of a land where he had put most of his wealth; but as a wise man, he had thought that he could, like other bourgeois of his acquaintance, barter his father's commoner name for a name that did honor to his crowns. M. Dufailly had become gradually and by a series of skilful transformations, first M. du Failly, then M. du Failly de Malzonvilliers, then finally M. de Malzonvilliers tout court. Now he was only waiting for the favorable opportunity to give himself a title, baron or knight. At the At a time when his business necessitated frequent trips to the provinces, and often even to Paris, M. de Malzonvilliers had repeatedly entrusted the management of his property to Guillaume Grinedal, who was considered the most honest craftsman in Saint-Omer. This confidence, in which M. de Malzonvilliers had always enjoyed himself, had established intimate and daily relations between the falconer and the trader, which benefited the three children, Jacques, Claudine and Pierre. Suzanne, who was about Claudine's age, had teachers of all kinds, and the lessons were useful to everyone, so much so that Father Guillaume's sons soon knew more than half the petty bourgeois of Saint Omer. de Malzonvilliers had repeatedly entrusted the management of his property to Guillaume Grinedal, who passed for the most honest craftsman of Saint-Omer.

Jacques especially profited from this teaching; as he had a just and persevering mind, he persisted in things until he had understood them. You often met him in the fields, his head bare, his feet in clogs and a book in his hand, and he didn't let go of him until he had gotten it into his head. Only one thing could deter him from this occupation, it was the pleasure he tasted in seeing his father handle the old weapons that were brought to him from the four corners of the city and from the castles of the neighborhood to restore them. Guillaume Grinedal was the best arquebusier in the canton; it was an art he had learned when he was master of falconry with M. d'Assonville, and which would have brought him a lot of money if he had wanted to. exercise in the hope of gain. But, in his condition, he acted like an artist, wanting nothing more than a fair wage for his work, which he always considered less than it was worth. Jacques often amused himself by helping him, and when he had polished up a hauberk or some sword, he considered himself the happiest boy in the country, provided, however, that Mademoiselle de Malzonvilliers gave him her daily smile at daybreak. When Suzanne walked in the falconer's garden in the company of children and domestic animals who lived there on good terms, she offered, with Jacques, the strangest contrast that could be seen. Jacques was tall, strong, vigorous. His black eyes, full of firmness and brilliance, shone under a forehead browned by tan and full of thick blond hair curls. At the slightest movement of his arms, one understood that in a jiffy he would have uprooted a young tree or made an ox bend on its hocks; but at the least word from Suzanne, he blushed. Suzanne, on the contrary, had an exquisite delicacy of form and features; at fifteen she looked barely twelve or thirteen; his pale face, his slender figure, his frail limbs indicated a nervous organization of extreme delicacy. His feet and hands belonged to childhood. But the calm and radiant gaze of her large blue eyes full of life and intelligence, the clear and firm contours of her mouth announced at the same time the resolution of an honest and courageous soul. She had the body of a child and the smile of a woman. When he happened to asleep in the shade of an oak tree, his head resting on Jacques' shoulder, the poor boy remained motionless as long as his girlfriend was asleep, and, in mute contemplation, he admired the young and pure face that rested on his heart with such naive abandon. When the young girl parted her rosy, serious lips, Jacques held his breath to hear better. His soul swayed at Suzanne's voice like a willow branch at the slightest breath of wind, and sometimes he felt, as he listened to her, tears rise to his eyelids, the cause of which was unknown to him, but from which the divine source was flowing. in his heart. he admired the young and pure face that rested on his heart with such naive abandon.

One day in the month of May 1658, five years before the time when this story begins, and a little time before the glorious battle of the Dunes, Jacques, who could have been then thirteen or fourteen years old, saw coming to him, while he was walking in a meadow, a short distance from Saint-Omer, a stranger dressed in rather shabby clothes. One might have taken him for some deserter, in his attire which was as much civilian as military, if the foreigner had not been counterfeited. You couldn't be a soldier with a bump on your shoulder, and Jacques thought he must be a peddler. The stranger followed a path traced by the market gardeners between the vegetable plants, and sometimes raised himself on a mound to look over the hedges in the countryside. When he was close to Jacques, he stopped and stared at him for a moment. Jacques was leaning against a large apple tree, his hands in the pockets of a canvas blouse, whistling between his teeth. After a few minutes of reflection, the stranger walked towards him.

"Are you from this country, my boy?" he said to him.

"Yes, sir," replied Jacques.If Jacques had been asked why he had greeted the man he took for a peddler by the name of Monsieur , he would have had great difficulty in explaining it. The stranger had an air that impressed Jacques, although Guillaume Grinedal's son was not easily intimidated. He spoke, looked, and acted with extreme simplicity, but in that simplicity there was more nobility and pride than in all the importance of M. de Malzonvilliers.

"If that's the case," resumed the stranger, "you can no doubt point me to someone capable of riding a long race?"

“You have that person in front of you, sir.

-You?

-Myself.

“But, my little friend, you seem very young to me! Do you know that it is a question of galloping seven or eight leagues without unbridling?

“Don't worry about age; just give me the horse, and you'll see.

The stranger smiled, then added:

“He is restive and full of fire…

—I have a good arm and a good eye, he can run…

“Come then; the horse is not far away.

The stranger and Jacques left the meadow and entered a small wood. Right in the middle, behind a thicket, Jacques saw a horse prancing about, circling around an elm to which it was tied. A frenum bound on his nostrils kept him from neighing. Jacques had never seen such a beautiful animal, even in the stables of M. de Malzonvilliers. He approached the horse, caressed its hindquarters, loosened the brake which irritated it, and was about to jump into the saddle, when the stranger gently put his hand on his shoulder.

“Before you leave,” he told her, “at least you have to know where you have to go.

"That's right," replied Jacques, who already had his foot in the stirrup.

His impatience to gallop on such a proud horse had made him forget the purpose of the race.

"Do you know where the little village of Witternesse is?"

"Very well: about a league away, on the right, near Aire."

“That's where you're going; now remember this: before entering Witternesse, you will see on the left a farm at the end of a field of rye. There are four windows with a dovetail weather vane on the roof. You will knock three times at the door; at the third stroke, you will pronounce aloud the name of Bergamo; a man will come out and you will give him this paper...

As he finished these words, the stranger took a small wallet from his pocket, took out a pencil and began to write.

—Do you know how to read? he asked Jacques abruptly.

“Yes, sir, very well.

The stranger frowned; but this movement was so rapid that Jacques had no time to notice it. For a moment the stranger turned the pencil between his fingers; then, taking a sudden resolution, he quickly wrote a few words, tore up the sheet, and presenting it to Jacques, gave the child a deep look. Jacques examined the paper.

"I read, but I don't understand," he said.

The stranger smiles.

"It is not necessary for you to understand," he resumed; put the paper in your pocket and jump on horseback... Good!... Parbleu, my boy, you hold yourself cheerfully!... if you go about it this way, you will not serve as a fascine in some ditch... However, always have the eyes on the ears of the animal… it is whimsical; but when he is in the mood to swerve, he has the honesty to warn his rider by a certain movement of the ears, the memory of which many people have preserved. Ah! you laugh! you will see, my boy!

As Jacques let go of the horse's bridle, the stranger held him back.

“One more word. Do you know of a house of honest people in the neighborhood where I can await your return without fear of indiscreet people?

“I know ten of them, but there's one in particular that will suit you. Come out of the woods, follow the path where I met you, take the main road and stop in front of the first house you will find on your right. You will recognize it easily. Everything is open, doors and windows. You will be with my father, Guillaume Grinedal, just like at home.

-Devil! but I'll be fine there, said the stranger with a smile. Go now.

He removed his hand from the bracelet, and the horse rode off. A quarter of an hour later, the stranger entered Guillaume Grinedal's garden. At the sight of a stranger, the falconer left a long pommel pistol which he was polishing and stood up.

"What are you asking?" he said to him.

—Hospitality.

-Come in. What I have is yours. If you are hungry, you will eat; if you are thirsty, you will drink; and however poor I am, I always have a bed for the traveler whom God leads.

While speaking thus, Father Guillaume had uncovered his forehead; his honest features, wrinkled with work, retained an expression of dignity which made him seem above his station.

"Thank you," said the stranger; my visit will be short. When your son returns, I will leave.

Guillaume looked at him questioningly.

-Oh! resumed his host, he is in no danger. Before the moon has risen, he will be back. I am a merchant from Arras who goes, for the business of my trade, to Lille; the country is bad, and I thought that your son could, more surely than I, take charge of a suitcase left in the hands of my valet at Witternesse. One cannot take too many precautions in the times in which we live.

While the stranger was talking, Pierre, Claudine and a few children, scattered at first in the garden, had quietly lined up around him, with that avid and fierce curiosity which seeks a thousand detours to satisfy itself and is astonished at everything. what she sees. Guillaume waved them aside and begged the stranger to follow him, to which the latter submitted without deliberating.

"You are right," resumed the falconer when they reached the lower room of the house, "we live in a time when we must surround ourselves with precautions. But in the house of an honest man it is not needed; so, my gentleman, don't hesitate to disguise your language and your manners.

At these words, the stranger started.

“I don't ask you your rank and your name,” resumed the falconer. The host is sacred; his secret is like his person; but one must not speak in front of the children; children have the right sense, they understand and guess; as soon as you open your mouth they listen. It is therefore prudent to remain silent. Me, I have gray hair, I saw nothing, heard nothing, understood nothing.

"You are a brave man!" cried the stranger impetuously. Mordieu! I have no need to dissemble with you. You are not mistaken, Master Guillaume, I am...

“Perhaps more than I imagine,” added the falconer hastily, “and that is why I am taking the liberty of interrupting you, so as not to know more. Whether you are Spanish or French, you are none the less a traveler entrusted to my care. This roof protects you. If you are one of those who drew the sword against their king and their country, it is up to God to judge you. I'm doing my homework; may you say: I do mine.

The false merchant looked down at the serene gaze of the craftsman, and the blush flashed across his forehead. But immediately recovering his serenity, he waved to the old falconer.“Be it so, my good fellow, I will not burden your memory with a recollection; but, by the name of my father, I will not forget yours, nor what you do.

Two hours passed, and the stranger shared the falconer's dinner, at his ease, as if in a soldier's tent, or in the hotel of a great lord. Then two more happened; at the end of the fourth, worry brought the tips of his eyebrows closer together. He walked to the window and opened it, listening; night had come, and the road was noiseless. Soon he left the cottage and walked towards the garden gate. Father Guillaume followed him. Like the darkness, the silence was deep.

"Your son is brave?" said the stranger abruptly to the falconer.

“Honest and brave as steel.

"So he would defend a deposit entrusted to his fidelity?"

“He's only a child, but he'd be killed like a man.

“Then I fear for your son, Master Guillaume.

The father did not answer, but, in the rays of the moon, the stranger saw the pallor spreading over his forehead. Both kept silent, their eyes fixed on the white line of the path which drowned in a vague and limitless horizon. The mysteries of the night filled the space with confused, rapid, uncertain noises. Guillaume Grinedal was leaning on the sticks of a slatted hedge; the wood could be heard cracking under the effort of his hands. The gentleman crumpled the lapels of his coat.

"Nothing, nothing yet!" he whispered. Oh! I would give a thousand louis to hear a horse gallop!

As he spoke, a detonation sounded in the distance, beyond the woods whose thick shadows cut the horizon. The hedge broke under the hand of the falconer, who jumped onto the road.

-A shot! Did you hear it? exclaimed the gentleman.

"I heard it," replied Guillaume Grinedal, throwing himself face down on the road.

Two more detonations rang out again, but the sound came from so far away that it needed the ear of a father or an outcast to distinguish them from the thousand noises that floated under the deep sky. Guillaume Grinedal listened with his ear glued to the ground.

-Well? said the gentleman.

"Nothing... nothing yet!" My heart beats and my ears ring, said the poor father. Ah! yes, now, a dull, jerky, continuous noise! He's approaching… it's the gallop of a horse!

-Oh! the brave child! cried the stranger with an explosion.

Guillaume Grinedal said nothing, but uncovering his forehead whitened by the years, he raised his eyes to the sky and prayed. The gentleman stared into space, his head tilted forward: it was as if his sparkling eyes wanted to pierce the dark transparency of the night.

"I see it, mordieu!" I see him! The horse has wings and the child is on it.

The gentleman seized the falconer's arm.

"Don't you recognize him?" he said.But the falconer thanked God; two large tears trembled at the edge of her eyelids and her agitated lips murmured thanksgiving. The stranger withdrew his hand, and full of religious emotion, lifted his hat. In a few leaps the horse came upon them. The child jumped on the road, and fell into the arms of the falconer.

-My father! he cried.

The father, silent, pressed him to his heart.

"But," said Guillaume Grinedal suddenly, "there's blood on your clothes." Are you hurt?

"It's nothing," replied Jacques, "a bullet tore my blouse, there, near the shoulder, and scratched me, I believe!"

"Thou art a valiant lad, on my faith," said the gentleman; if you ever enlist under the colors of His Majesty King Louis, true God! you will go your own way. Come on, do you have the suitcase?

"Here she is on the horse's croup."

“Poor Phoebus! You drove it rough, huh? said the stranger cheerfully, passing his hand over the horse's neck.

Phoebus rubbed his foaming nostrils on the gentleman's coat, pricked up his ears at the master's voice, whinnied, and stamped his foot on the ground.

"So you have been prosecuted?" resumed the stranger while unbuckling the suitcase.

"A short league from Witternesse I had to leave the main road to avoid a party of Spanish marauders," replied Jacques. Two leagues further on, in front of Roquetoire, near Blendecques, I fell in the middle of a band of hussars and Imperials who were beating the dais. They pushed me hard for a quarter of an hour. But Phoebus has good legs. At the entrance to the wood they lost my tracks. Ah! I forgot! Bergamo entrusted me with a letter for you. There she is.

The gentleman broke the seal, and approaching the window, he read rapidly by the light of a lamp.

“It is well, my child. If some day we meet, me old man, you man, in whatever situation we find ourselves one and the other, you can appeal to the guest of Guillaume Grinedal; he will remember.

At daybreak the stranger jumped into the saddle of Phoebus, who had forgotten, between a fresh litter and two bushels of oats, the fatigues of the evening. The stranger wore the costume of a peasant from Artois.

"Adieu, Guillaume," he said to the falconer, holding out his hand; I offer you nothing: your hospitality is one that is not paid for, and I would be afraid to offend you by giving you gold. Take my hand, and squeeze it fearlessly. Under whatever dress I hide, it is, I swear to you, the hand of a loyal gentleman. As for you, my friend Jacques, preserve your honest heart and your determined courage, and fortune will come to your aid: if God lends me life, I will pray that he will provide me with the opportunity to help you as you rescued.

Jacques' large black eyes gazed at the stranger, shining with proud joy. With his deformed shoulder and his counterfeit chest, the false merchant of Arras seemed to him nobler and more imposing than any of the king's officers he had yet seen. When he took her hand, Jacques' heart beat rapidly, and when, squeezing Phoebus's sides, the stranger galloped away, father and son followed him with their eyes for a long time, moved and silent. As they entered the garden, Jacques' foot rolled a shiny object that had fallen on the sand. It was a guilloché gold medallion.

"See, my father," said the child; the stranger will no doubt have lost it.

“Keep it, my son; it is perhaps Providence which sends it to you.
