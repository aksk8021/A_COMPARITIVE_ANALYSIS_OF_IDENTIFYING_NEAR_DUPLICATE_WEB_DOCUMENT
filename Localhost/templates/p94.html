The way in which it happened that he’s father first began to explain to him something about the nature of fire, was this: It was one evening early in the autumn. Dorothy was going away to visit one of her friends, and he was waiting for Jonas to come out, and see the fire-flies, or lightning-bugs, as he called them, which were flying about the yard. But Jonas did not come as soon as he had expected, and so he went into the kitchen to see what had become of him. He found that, as Dorothy was rather late for her visit, and still had her kitchen fire to cover up, Jonas was just offering to cover it up for her, so that she could go at once without any further delay. So he came in, and stood by the kitchen hearth to see Jonas cover up the fire.

The fire had nearly burned out, but it had left quite a large bed of embers, and a few coals among them. Jonas took the long-handled iron shovel, which belonged to the kitchen fire, and with it he drew forward all these coals and embers, so as to leave the back part of the hearth bare. Then he took the tongs, and with the tongs he gathered out from the hot ashes all the coals which he could find among the ashes, and put them back upon the bare place which he had made upon the hearth. He spread them evenly over it in a row against the back of the chimney.

“What are you going to do, Jonas?” said he.

“I am going to cover up a stick of wood,” replied Jonas.

So Jonas opened a small door which led to a little wood closet by the side of the fire, and took out a short stick of wood, flat on one side and round on the other. It was a stick which was round first, but Jonas had split it in two. It was part of a great branch of a tree, large enough to make a good log, only Jonas saw that it would split easily, and so he had split it in two. The other half of it was still in the wood closet.

“This is just the stick,” said Jonas.

“Why?” asked he.

“Why, the lower side is flat,” said Jonas, “to lie upon the coals, and the top is round, so that I can cover it all up the easier.”

So Jonas laid the stick down, with the flat side against the coals, and the round side outwards. Then with the great shovel he began to shovel the ashes and embers back over it. He put all the hot embers in first, and then the ashes, and he tried to cover up the stick entirely; but there was not quite ashes enough. One of the ends remained out.

“There, Jonas,” said he, “now come.”

“No,” said Jonas, “I must cover the stick all up.”

“O, that little end won’t do any harm,” said he.

“Yes,” said Jonas, “because, when the stick burns down, that place would make a hole, and let too much air in.”

“Don’t you want any air to get in?” said he.

“Very little,” said Jonas. “I want a very slow combustion to go on until to-morrow morning, and then there will be a good bed of coals for Dorothy.”

“I don’t see why you take so much pains to cover up a stick of wood,” said he. “You might light a fire with your tinder-box.”

“But it takes a great deal longer to make a good fire with a tinder-box, than when we have a good bed of coals.”

“Then take a friction match,” said he. “I can light a friction match in half a minute.”

“You can light the match, but not build a fire. It takes a long time with a match light to get heat enough to set large sticks of wood on fire; but, with a bed of burning coals, we can do it very soon.”

“You might have some sticks and shavings for kindling,” said he, “and they will burn quick.”

“Yes,” said Jonas, “but it is more trouble to prepare sticks and shavings every night, than it is to cover up a stick of wood.”

While Jonas had been saying these things, he had taken more ashes from the ash-hole, and had covered the stick over entirely. He then put away the shovel, and was brushing up the hearth, when he, after standing a moment, as if in thought, said,—

“Jonas, what do you mean by combustion?”

“Did I say combustion?” rejoined Jonas.

“Yes, you said you wanted slow combustion.”

“Well, I meant burning. I want the wood to burn slowly all night.”

“Then why did not you say burning,” said he, “so that I could understand you. I don’t see where you get all your learned words. I suppose it is out of some of your books.”

“Yes,” said Jonas, “they call it combustion in the books that I read, but I don’t know exactly why. I think there must be some difference between combustion and burning, but I don’t know exactly what it is.”

“I mean to ask my father,” said he.

“But do you expect that that stick of wood will burn, Jonas?” continued he, after a moment’s pause.

“Yes,” said Jonas, “it will burn slowly. A little air will get through the ashes so as just to keep it burning slowly. It is very dry.”

“Suppose that there could not any air get through at all?” said he.

“Why, then,” said Jonas, “it couldn’t burn at all. It would go out. Sometimes I have buried up a fire so deep in ashes that it has gone out, and then I find nothing but black coals there in the morning, when I rake it open. That’s the way they make charcoal.”

“How?” said he.

But Jonas had no opportunity to answer this question then, for they were just going out into the yard when he asked it, and the attention of both the boys was attracted to the fire-flies. They, however, soon had looked at the fire-flies as much as they wished. he tried to catch one, but he could not. He would see a flash at a little distance from him, and he would run to the place with his cap in the air; but, by the time that he got there, the fire-fly would of course have gone on to another place, though he could not tell where, without waiting to see him flash again. Then he had to run again; but before he got to this second place the fire-fly would be gone again. One of the fire-flies led him a zigzag chase, in this way, all around the yard, and finally flashed at last just over the garden fence, so that he gave up in despair.

In the meantime, Jonas had gone to the barn; and now he went to see what had become of him. He found him shutting the doors up for the night, and then they both came back towards the house, and sat down upon the edge of the platform, under the piazza, and he asked Jonas to tell him how they made charcoal.

“Why, they only bury up wood, as I did my log, lightly, so that enough air can get in, until it is burnt through; and then they cover it up tight, so that no air can get in, and so it goes out; and when it is all cold, they open it, and find the heap is all black coals.”

“How big a heap do they make?” asked he.

“O, they make a very large heap, sometimes,” said Jonas; “as big as this.” So Jonas rose from his seat, and marked out a circle in the yard with a stick, which he had in his hand, in order to show he how large a heap they make, when they pile up wood for a charcoal bed.

“And how high do they make it?” asked he.

“As high as that” said Jonas; and he reached his stick up in the air as high as he could, to show he how high the heap was.

“That must take a great deal of wood,” said he.

“Yes,” said Jonas, “and when it is turned into charcoal, they get a great many loads of it.”

“How do they get ashes enough to cover it up?” asked he.

“O, they don’t cover it with ashes,” said Jonas; “they cover it with turf.”

“With turf?” repeated he.

“Yes,” said Jonas, “turf is the best thing to cover the heap with. If they had ashes, it would be very troublesome to put it on, and then it would be sliding down, and letting the fire break out. But they cut square pieces of turf, and cover the heap all over with them, very tight, and so only just air enough gets in to keep the fire slowly burning.”

“Slow combustion?” said he.

“Yes, slow combustion,” said Jonas.

“How do you set it on fire?” asked he.

“I believe they leave a hole in the middle,” said Jonas, “from the top down to the bottom, and then they put the fire down there.”

“I wonder if I couldn’t make a charcoal bed,” said he.

“Yes,” replied Jonas, “you might make a little one, I suppose.”

“How should I do it?” asked he.

“Why, you might take some dry wood from the shed, and wheel it down the lane, and through the gate into the pasture. Then you might take a spade, and cut up some turf, though that would be rather hard work for you.”

“I wish you would cut the turf for me,” said he.

“Well,” said Jonas, “perhaps I will. Then you must hollow out a little place in the bare spot I make by taking up the turf, and make your pile of wood there, leaving a hole in the middle.”

“How can I leave a hole?” asked he.

“Why, you can take three short pieces of board, as long as you intend the height of your pile to be, and stand them up on the ground, so as to leave a three-cornered space between them, and then pile your wood around the three boards.”

“So I can,” said he.

“Your wood must be small,” continued Jonas, “or else you can’t pile it very snugly in a small pile. You had better take small round sticks, and saw them short, and lean them up against your boards all around, and so make a snug pile. After the pile is ready, you must bank up a little against the bottom of your heap with the loose earth, and then begin to put on the turf. But that will be a nice business.”

“Why?” asked he.

“Because you must fit them carefully all around; and, as the heap will be round, and will grow smaller towards the top, square pieces of turf will not fit. You will have to cut them into shape with a knife. You can get an old knife to cut them with, and so fit them together. But you must fit them together well, or the air will get in, and your heap of wood will blaze up, and so it will be spoiled for charcoal.”

“I can make it tight,” said he, “I know. I’ll shave away the sides of every turf, till it fits its place exactly.”

“There must be some air,” said Jonas, “or else the wood will not burn at all. You must leave a few holes around at the bottom, to let a little air in, then you can plug some of them up, if you find the fire burns too fast.”

“Well,” said he, “I mean to make some charcoal some day. I’ll get my cousin James to come and help me. I’ll begin to saw up some wood for it to-morrow.

“But, then, Jonas,” he continued, after a moment’s pause, “what good will the charcoal do me when I get it made?”

“O, I don’t know,” said Jonas; “I wasn’t thinking of your getting any good from the charcoal. All the advantage would be, the pleasure of making it.”

“Isn’t there anything I can do with it,” said he, “when I get it made? What is charcoal good for?”

“It makes a very hot fire. They use it when they want a great heat. Blacksmiths use it in their forges.”

“I wish I had a little forge,” said he.

“They use it to make gunpowder, too,” said Jonas.

“How?” said he.

“Why, they take some charcoal, and some sulphur, and some saltpetre, and pound it up together, and it makes gunpowder.”

“That’s what I’ll do with my charcoal,” said he, jumping up from his seat. “I’ll make some gunpowder. I’ll ask my mother to give me some sulphur and saltpetre, and I’ll make some gunpowder.”

QUESTIONS.
What was the condition of the fire, on the evening when it was left to Jonas to cover up? Describe the arrangements which he made for covering up the fire. What was the shape of the stick of wood? Why was this form convenient for the purpose? What plan did he propose, instead of covering up the fire? What objection did Jonas make to this plan? What term did Jonas use to designate the process which would go forward, during the night, under the ashes? What did he say that combustion meant? Would any air at all be necessary for the slow combustion? How was the necessary air to get access to the wood? Why could not he catch the fire-flies? How did Jonas describe the process of making charcoal? What did he say were the uses of charcoal? To which of these uses did he intend to put his charcoal, if he should succeed in making any?

CHAPTER II.
LAMP-LIGHTING.
he did not think to ask his father the reason why the philosophers use such learned language, or, as he expressed it, such hard words, for several days. Perhaps he never would have thought of it again, if his father had not happened to use the word combustible one evening, which reminded him of the term combustion, which Jonas had used. The occasion on which his father used the word was this,—

One evening, he’s mother was trying to light a little lamp, to go into her bedroom for something that she wanted. There were, usually, in a little vase upon the mantel-piece, some lamp-lighters, which were long, slender rolls of paper, that he had rolled up for this purpose. They were kept in this vase upon the mantel-piece in order to be always ready for use. But the vase was now empty. The last lamp-lighter had been used; and so he’s mother folded up a small piece of paper, and attempted to light the little lamp, which she was going to carry into the bedroom, with that.

But the wick would not take fire, and he saw that, while his mother was continuing her efforts to make it burn, the flame of the paper was gradually creeping up nearer and nearer to her fingers. At last, finding that there would soon be danger of burning her fingers, she walked across the room towards a window which was open, still endeavoring to light the lamp. But it was all in vain. She reached the window just in time to throw the end of the paper out, and save her fingers from being burned.

“Why won’t it light?” said he.

he’s father was sitting upon the sofa, taking his rest after the labors of the day; and when he saw that the lamp failed of being lighted, he said,—

“You will have to get a longer lamp-lighter, unless you have got some spirits of turpentine to put upon the wick.”

“Spirits of turpentine?” repeated he.

“Yes,” said his father. “In hotels, where they have a great many lamps to light, they have a little bottle of spirits of turpentine with a wire running down into it; and, when they take out the wire, a little drop of the spirits of turpentine hangs to the end of it, and they touch this to the wick, and then it will light very quick.”

“Why, sir?” asked he.

“Because spirits of turpentine is very combustible, or rather inflammable.”

“That means it will burn very easily, I suppose,” said he.

“Yes,” replied his father.

“That makes me think of something Jonas said, which I was going to ask you,” said he. “He said that, in books, burning was always called combustion, and I told him I meant to ask you why they couldn’t as well call it burning.”

“I don’t think that Jonas said exactly that,” said his father.

“Yes, sir, he did,” replied he; “at least, I understood him so.”

“It is true, no doubt,” added his father, “that, in philosophical books, philosophical terms are very often used, instead of the common language which we ordinarily employ.”

“Why are they, father?” said he. “I think the common words are a great deal easier to understand.”

“Yes,” said his father, “but they are not precise in their signification. They are vague and ambiguous, and so philosophers, when they wish to speak accurately, employ other terms, which have an exact signification.”

he looked perplexed. He did not understand at all what his father meant. In the meantime, his mother had brought a fresh bundle of lamp-lighters from the closet, and had lighted her lamp with one of them, and was just going away. As she was going out, however, she said to her husband,—

“Please to wait a minute, until I come back, for I should like to hear what you are going to say.”

“Well,” said he; “and you, he, may come and sit down by me, and I will explain it to you when mother comes back.”

So he came and took a seat on the sofa by the side of his father, saying,—

“Father, I wish you would have a bottle of spirits of turpentine for us to light our lamps by.”

“It is not of much advantage in a family,” said his father, “where the lamps are lighted in various parts of the house, and only a few in all to be lighted. But where there are a great many, it is quite a saving of time to have a little spirits of turpentine to tip the wicks with. In an illumination they always touch the wicks so, and by that means they can light up suddenly.”

“But, father, why will the wick light any quicker?”

“Why, different substances take fire at different temperatures. For instance, if you were to put a little heap of sulphur, and another little heap of sawdust, on a shovel together, and put them over a fire, so as to heat them both equally, the sulphur would take fire very soon, but the sawdust would not until the shovel was very nearly red hot. So if you were to put oil in a little kettle over the fire, and spirits of turpentine in another kettle, and have the fire the same under both, the spirits of turpentine would inflame long before the oil. There is a great difference in different substances, in regard to the temperature at which they inflame.”

“What do you mean by temperature, father?” said he.

“Why, heat,” said his father.

“Then why don’t you say heat?” said he.

His father laughed.

“What are you laughing at, father?” said he.“Why, that’s the same question that you asked me at first, and I promised to wait till mother came before I explained it. So we will wait until she comes.”

They did not have to wait long, for he’s mother soon returned; and she put out her lamp by means of a little extinguisher which was attached to the stem of the lamp itself. Then she sat down at the table, by the light of a great lamp which was burning upon it, and took out her work.

he’s father then repeated to her what he had just been telling he, namely, that different substances took fire at different degrees of heat; and he said that it would be a very interesting experiment to take a long iron bar, and put a small quantity of several different substances upon it, in a row, and then heat the bar gradually, from end to end all alike, until it was very hot, and so see in what order the various substances would take fire.

“I would have,” said he, “phosphorus, sulphur, sawdust, charcoal, saltpetre, oil,—we should have to make a little hollow in the iron for the oil,—alcohol, spirits of turpentine, and perhaps other things. The phosphorus would take fire first, I suppose, and then perhaps the sulphur, and others in succession.”

“Well, father,” said he, “I wish you would. I should like to see the experiment very much.”

“No,” said his father, “I cannot actually try such an experiment as that. I could not get such a bar very conveniently; and, if I had the bar and all the substances, I could not heat the bar exactly equally. It could not be done very well, except in a chemical laboratory. But it would be a very pretty experiment, if it could be performed.”

“Is there a very great difference,” said he’s mother, “in the degree of heat necessary to set fire to these different things?”

“Yes,” said Mr. Holiday, “I believe the difference is very great. Phosphorus inflames below the heat of boiling water, but it takes almost a red heat to set wood on fire. And iron will not take fire till it is white hot.”

“Iron?” said he, with surprise.

“Yes,” said his father, “iron will take fire and burn as well as wood, if you heat it hot enough.”

“I never knew that,” said he.

“The ends of the tongs and of the andirons do not burn,” said his father, “simply because the fire is never hot enough to set such a large piece of iron on fire. But if we heat the end of a bar of iron very hot indeed in a furnace, it will take fire and burn; and so, if we take a very minute piece of iron, as big as the point of a pin, a common fire would be sufficient to heat that hot enough to set it on fire.”

“Well, father,” said he, “let us try it.”

“If we had some iron filings, we might sprinkle them in the fire, or even in the flame of a lamp, and they would burn.”

“I wish I had some filings,” said he.

“Yes,” said his father, “they burn beautifully.”

“How can I get some?” asked he.

“You can get some at a blacksmith’s shop,” said his father. “The filings commonly accumulate behind the vice, and you can get plenty of them there. The next time you go by a blacksmith’s shop, you had better go in and ask him to give you some.”

“Well,” said he, “so I will.”

“And now do you understand,” said his father, “why it is that you can light a lamp more easily when there is a little spirits of turpentine on the wick?”

“Yes, sir,” said he. “The spirits of turpentine need not get so hot before it catches fire, and so you don’t have to hold the lamp-lighter so long, and burn your fingers.”

“Will oil always take fire when it gets to a certain degree of heat?” asked he’s mother.

“Yes,” said his father, “I suppose so.”

“And yet,” said she, “the lamp seems to take fire much more easily at some times, than at others.”

“Yes,” said Mr. Holiday, “that is true. If the wick is cut square across, and rises up only a very little way above the tube, it is very difficult to light it, because the tube itself and the oil below keep the upper end of the wick cool. It is very hard to heat it, in that case, hot enough to set it on fire. But if the wick projects considerably out of the tube, then it is out of the way of the cooling influence of the metal, and you can heat the upper end more easily.”

“I never thought of that,” said he.

“That is the operation of it,” said his father. “And if you push the wick open a little, so as to separate some of the fibres of it from the rest, then it will take fire more easily still; because the small part which is separated, is more easily heated up to the necessary point, than it was when it was closely in contact with the rest, and so kept cool by it. That is the reason why a thin shaving takes fire so much more easily than the outside of a large piece of wood. The outside of a large piece is kept cool by the parts of the wood behind it, which touch it, while the shaving is heated through very soon.”

“I didn’t know that before,” said he.

“In the cities,” continued his father, “the lamp-lighters, that trim and light the street lamps, always cut the wick off, when they trim the lamps, in a slanting direction, so as to leave a point of the wick projecting up on one side. This point will light very easily, for it stands by itself, somewhat apart from the rest, and so is not kept cool by the rest of the wick. Then, when they put in their great, blazing torch, it heats this point to the degree necessary to inflame the oil very easily.

“There is one thing more I want to tell you, and that will be all I have to say about lamps to-night; and that is, to explain to you the philosophy of putting them out. You must understand that two things are necessary to carry on combustion or burning. First, there must be air; and secondly, the body burning must be kept above a certain degree of heat. Now, if you either suddenly shut off the air from the substance that is burning, or suddenly cool the substance, it will go out. For instance, the wick,—you have to heat it to a certain degree before it will take fire. Now, if, after it is burning, you suddenly cool it below that degree, it will go out; or if you shut out the air from it, then it will go out; for it cannot burn unless it continues hot, and unless it continues to have a supply of air.

“Now, when we blow out a lamp, we stop the burning by cooling it. The cool air which we blow against it, suddenly cools the upper end of the wick below the point of combustion, and so it goes out. On the other hand, when we put it out by an extinguisher, we stop the burning by means of shutting out the air. Either mode will stop the combustion.”

“And how is it when we put on water?” asked he’s mother.

“Why, that is somewhat different from either,” said Mr. Holiday, “or rather it is both combined. There is something very curious in the operation of water upon fire; that I must explain some other day, for now it is time for he to go to bed.”

QUESTIONS.
What was the difficulty in lighting the lamp, as described in the beginning of this chapter? What method did Mr. Holiday say was sometimes adopted in hotels to make the lamps light quick? Why would this make them light more easily? What question did he ask his father in respect to the use of philosophical language? Why did not his father answer the question immediately? Do all substances take fire at the same temperature? What substances take fire with the least degree of heat? What experiment did Mr. Holiday describe which he said would show this very distinctly? Why could not he perform this experiment? Will iron burn? Why do not bars of iron burn in a common fire? How did Mr. Holiday propose to show that iron would burn? How did he propose that he should get some iron filings?

CHAPTER III.
BURNING IRON.
When he went out into the kitchen that evening to get his safety lamp,—the one which he usually took to go to bed,—he found Jonas sitting at the kitchen table reading; and while he was lighting his lamp, he asked Jonas if he would not get him some iron filings the next time he went near any blacksmith’s shop. Jonas asked him what he wanted of iron filings, and he said he wanted them to burn. He then repeated to him what his father had said in respect to the combustibility of iron.

“I can make iron filings enough for that experiment in five minutes,” said Jonas.

“How?” said he.

“With a file,” replied Jonas.

“Well,” said he; and without waiting to hear anything further, he ran back to the parlor to ask his mother to let him sit up long enough to see Jonas make a few iron filings to try the experiment.

“Won’t it do as well to-morrow morning?” asked his mother.

“The scintillations will look brighter in the evening,” said Mr. Holiday.

“Very well, then,” added his mother, “go, and, if Jonas succeeds in his experiment, ask him to send some filings in to us.”

So he went out to find Jonas again. Jonas was gone. Dorothy said that he had gone after a file. In a few minutes he returned, with a file in one hand, and a large iron spike in the other.

“What is the spike for?” asked he.

“Only for a piece of iron to file,” replied Jonas. So saying, he took a small piece of paper out of a drawer, and laid it upon the table. Then he rested one end of the spike upon the paper, and, holding the other end in his hand, he filed it several times in such a way, that the filings fell down upon the paper.

“What fine filings!” said he.

“Yes,” said Jonas; “the file is almost worn out, and it does not cut very well.”

he looked upon the paper. There were quite a number of small, black points upon it like grains of very fine sand. Jonas then took up the paper carefully by the two sides, bending the two sides upward at the same time, to keep the filings in the middle of the paper. In this way he raised the paper above the lamp, which was upon the table before him, and then holding it in an inclined position, he let the sand slide down into the flame of the lamp. To he’s surprise and delight, it produced a column of sparkles rising up from the flame, which were of the greatest brilliancy and beauty.

“Yes,” said he, “they burn, they burn most beautifully. File me some more, Jonas, and let me carry them in and show them to my mother.”

Jonas accordingly filed some more filings, and he went in with them very eagerly, to show to his mother.

“Just look,” said he; and so saying, he held the paper over the lamp in such a manner as to let the filings slide down into the flame just as Jonas had done. The experiment succeeded perfectly well, as it had done before.

“So you see that it will burn,” said Mr. Holiday, “if you heat it hot enough.”

“If you make it small enough, you mean,” said he.

“I suppose the smallness of the particles is of no consequence,” replied his father, “excepting to make it easier to heat them.”

“Why, father,” said he, “I might put the end of a knitting-needle in the lamp, and I don’t see why it wouldn’t become as hot as one of the iron filings.”

“Because,” said his father, “a part of the heat would be conveyed away through the knitting-needle towards your hand, and that would keep the end which was in the flame cooler.”

“Would it, sir,” asked he.

“Yes,” said his father. “The heat moves off very fast in such a case. You know, if you take a pin between your fingers, and hold the head of it in the lamp, the heat will almost immediately move along the metal, so as to heat the end that you are holding, and burn you.”

“Yes, sir,” said he; “I have got burned so, very often.”

“And of course much more heat would be conveyed away when the metal was as thick as a knitting-needle.”

“Well, father,” said he, “suppose a piece of the knitting-needle was broken off, and made so small that it could all be in the flame; then would it burn?”

“How could you keep it there?” asked his father.

“Why—I don’t know,” said he, hesitating. “Couldn’t we contrive some way to keep it there?”

“I don’t know of any way.”

“Couldn’t we put it on the end of the wick?” asked he.

“Yes,” said his father, “perhaps we might; but then the end of the wick is cool, and that would cool it.”

“O, father,” said he, in a tone of great surprise, “the end of the wick cool, when it is right in the middle of the blaze!”

“I mean,” replied his father, “that it is cool compared with the heat necessary for inflaming the iron. It would feel very hot to your fingers, I have no doubt, for it is filled with boiling oil. But then even the heat of boiling oil is less than that necessary to inflame iron; and so the contact of the wick with such a piece of iron as you propose, would keep it cool, or rather keep it from getting hot enough to take fire.”

“Suppose there was any way,” said he’s mother, “of suspending a piece of iron as large as the end of a knitting-needle in the lamp; do you think it would take fire?”

“No,” said Mr. Holiday, “I don’t think it would be heated hot enough. For some reason or other, I don’t understand exactly what, a large piece of iron cannot be heated very hot in a small fire, even if the fire entirely covers it. I don’t think that any fragment of iron much larger than one of Jonas’s filings could be heated in a lamp so as to take fire. But it could be heated hot enough in a forge. The end of the iron which a blacksmith heats is often in a state of combustion when he takes it out of the fire.”

“There, now, father,” said he, “you have not explained to me yet about combustion and burning.”

“No,” said his father; “we had almost forgotten that. I will explain it now. It will only take a few minutes. Let me see—I began to tell you didn’t I?”

“Yes, sir,” said he; “but I couldn’t understand very well.”

“I was telling you that the language which we use in common conversation is not precise. It is often ambiguous.”

“What does that mean, sir?” said he.

“Why, language is ambiguous when it has two meanings,” said his father. “For instance, the word burning is used in conversation to express two or three very different things. If you put your finger upon hot iron, you say you have burned it. Burn, in that case, is the name of a painful feeling. But if you say you burned a piece of paper, you mean that you put it into the fire, and allowed it to be consumed. In that case, burning, instead of being the name of a painful feeling, is the name of a peculiar process by which the paper is consumed and destroyed. Thus the word burn is used to denote two very different effects. In fact, it is used in other senses besides these.”
