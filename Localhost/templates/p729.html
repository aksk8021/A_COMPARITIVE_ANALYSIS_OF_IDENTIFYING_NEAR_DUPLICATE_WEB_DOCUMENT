"I'm going to seem like an insufferable chatterbox to you," she said, "yet you're touching on questions here, how shall I put it? to which one must have an answer, if one wants to live in peace… and, on the other hand, I am not in the habit of talking about these things. You understand: my part is the olives, it's the vegetables, it's the mushrooms, it's the cooking and the housework, it's not the words... To use it honestly, it's you have to know, and I don't feel very skilled in this job. With Victor, I don't have much difficulty: we understand each other half-heartedly; things are not going too badly with Mr. Maurice either, because he immediately understands what I would like to say, and says it for me, but in front of you, Mr. Serval, I feel very apprehensive and you are perhaps going to to find myself very daring!

- No, Madame Michel, I replied, be quiet about it. »

Mahoudiaux chuckled fondly as he prepared to light his pipe.

“Above all, says Mrs.Michel, we are here to live, aren't we, Monsieur Serval? but life is not always funny: the storm shakes the fruit trees, the horse hurts its leg, the child catches a cold, the husband is in a bad mood, the wife falls ill; so we try to make life more beautiful so that it continues to please and keeps this good fresh taste that quenches thirst and gives appetite… How to go about it? We look elsewhere, further; we try to be something else, to feel differently; we try to see more clearly through the eyes of the passerby, the neighbour, the friend, or even the stranger. Soon, the world seems bigger and we are happy to be there, living in the sun, and we only ask to continue. I think, Monsieur Serval, that when you make a painting, you have to… it seems to me at least (I'm going to be stupid! ) you have to be in your painting much more than on your folding stool, and when you do a portrait, you have to be in the head of the person you are looking at; in his head and in his heart, of course. It must be like this for Mr. Maurice when he travels in his library, for Victor when I see him frowning without being angry, for the little one, finally, when he plays soldier. Ah! how you would astonish him by telling him that he is the young Maurice Michel! no, he's a soldier until the end of recess! Thus, each, in his own way, goes a little from home. Those who still remain there, I believe they should only think of the dead branch of the fig tree, of the wine stain that could not be removed from the edge of the new table, to the torn breeches of some little Maurice and the increase in the price of things since the war; so those are sad, and that's quite natural, isn't it? since they shut themselves up to create misfortune; but if you allow yourself a vacation, you must have worked hard, and no one has the right, as I was telling you, to go out before the house is in order and the soup soaked, because the important c is to live first… Yes, it is to live first that the good Lord has placed us here. Now I am silent, gentlemen, apologizing to you. » to leave before the house is in order and the soup is soaked, because the important thing is to live first… Yes, it is to live first that the good Lord placed us here. Now I am silent, gentlemen, apologizing to you. » to leave before the house is in order and the soup is soaked, because the important thing is to live first… Yes, it is to live first that the good Lord placed us here. Now I am silent, gentlemen, apologizing to you. »

And Madame Michel turned quite red.

"Beautiful wisdom," said Mahoudiaux, while we took the road to La Cassolette together a few moments later, "beautiful wisdom that that of this woman who is better educated, more cultured than her peers, and who has not downgraded herself, who married, in the rank of her family, with a good man, and who asks nothing more!

"I indeed admire it, dear friend, but have you noticed the very singular connection between his last words and the dangerous daydreams of our poor Stork?" She too feels this need which possesses her to live outside of herself, to see herself other than we are, and yet she seems to sow happiness around her; and we couldn't say the same for him!

'You're right, Serval, it's the same need of the soul that manifests itself in Marie Michel, in Roger, in many other people, I think; nevertheless, the joy that Marie gives herself is a pain in Roger's case: a generous reverie is transposed into a cruel torture, without greatness. Mary told you the reason. The image we have of Marie Michel is indeed Marie Michel who offers it to us through her actions, her feelings, her thoughts, her words; Stork's image is always a reflection… of whom? of what?... we don't know! of the last book read, of the last landscape looked at, of the last sentence heard. Mary rises by becoming another, for she does so with a light heart, with a calm heart; when it borrows someone's eyes, ears or imagination, it is to use it usefully, while Roger seeks only a vain sensation; seeing himself other than he is, he loses himself and harms others.

- In short, it is out of generosity that Ms. Michel dreams like this.

'I think so: in a way, she finds a new training ground for his kindness; it opens to his gaze luminous horizons which give him clearer eyes; to his imagination it offers perspectives which make it possible to discover a larger dream; she shows her charity examples which will help her to sympathize better. Ah! Certainly, Marie was born with a charming soul, but she knew how to cultivate it to make it even rarer. »

We arrived at the Porte de la Cassolette. At the very end of the alley Lucienne could be seen reading the newspaper with Cigogne lying down.

“Thank you, Mahoudiaux, for introducing me to your friend Madame Michel .

'Thank you, Serval,' he replied, 'for having understood her so well. »

And, having said that, we entered.

CHAPTER L
The attempt was arduous and in no way facilitated by the way the model posed. I thought at first that I would never get out of it, that I would saber my canvas with vermilion or that, in a movement of impatience, I would throw everything up in the air. Without stopping, the most diverse emotions paraded over Cigogne's face and it was, to tell the truth, the portrait of a rapid procession of dissimilar men that I was undertaking there, not that of just one. He chatted a lot, which usually doesn't bother me to work, but it was himself that he distracted with his chat by telling me (in what a pathetic, indifferent, pleasant, lugubrious, feverish and flat tone immediately!) the impressions he gathered from re-reading Balzac's novels. I know "the Human Comedy" well; I no longer have the immediate memory that exalted Cigogne.Mrs. de Morsauf , trembled in the walled cabinet of the Grande-Bretèche.

"Stork!" you do not read: you devour, and you assimilate instantaneously.

'You can imagine, Serval, that I'm rereading all that; nevertheless, these novels excite me as on the first day; maybe more.

“Of course, but for God's sake, just keep quiet.

"I don't move much, old man!" How can I ?

'You don't do somersaults, you do worse: your expression changes every moment. It's not your portrait that I should offer you, it's a film of your face.

- Lets go ! lets go ! don't get angry!… Can I smoke a cigarette?

"Yes, provided you leave Esther Gobseck alone."

- What do you want ! these people delight me! When I walk with them, I'm really in Paris, and the hindsight of the years doesn't bother me at all. Ah! Serval! when she came in just now, with that air that was both mysterious and ironic… There you go! you're still sulking!

“No, Stork, I'm trying to make up your mind; it's quite another thing and you're not making my job easy.

"I won't say another word...

- I do not ask so much!

- Only, you will not prevent me from thinking!

— My old Stork, I will never allow myself such great freedom.

"And they're alive, those fellows!" They act, they go, they come, they die, they lie, they love, they deceive… No! I am silent for good. »

Indeed, he was still thinking, and his face clearly showed the games of his brain.

I worked for about three-quarters of an hour.

“Now, I said to him, rest! I'm going for a little walk by the sea."

Our posing sessions were often of the same kind. Sometimes Lucienne would come and chat with him and all that was visible on the poor madman's face was a very obvious boredom. I still preferred the Balzac decor. I had begged my friends not to look at this painting: it was giving me too much trouble; I preferred to be alone to see her; she worried me, I didn't understand her, I didn't feel exactly where I was going with this. On the other hand, I declared myself satisfied with the background: the gray tone of the balustrade seemed right to me, as also that of the pines, dark and dense, protruding from the stone and cut out at their tops against a band of sky reddened by the setting sun. . Yes, that was good, but the mouth, Stork's mouth, what did it look like? And I repeated to myself:

“How I would like to do a portrait of Lucienne, after the three-pencil drawing that her husband dislikes; a true portrait of this calm face, where the look would have all its softness, where the mouth would show its rest, its elegance, its goodness without flabby, where the flight of the neck would be graceful, with a scarf to accompany the line and cover the shoulder… But this stork's face, what does it mean? »

Eight days later, the sketch was sufficiently advanced for it to be possible to let it be seen. I was about to ask my friends to come into the studio, when the voice of Mahoudiaux was heard, crying:

“Ah! Serval! come down to the garden! Victor Michel has arrived. »

CHAPTER LI
From the lavender notebook.

I really don't know where to turn. I need courage to write these few lines before throwing myself on my bed and trying to find sleep there. I can't take it anymore. I'm almost happy to feel so weak, so tired, because without this fatigue I would go mad. Yet, what happened? All in all, nothing but very natural: M. Serval has finished the sketch of my husband's portrait and M. Victor Michel, who has arrived here on leave and is visiting his friend Mahoudiaux, has lingered to chat with us. So… yes, but could we predict?

Roger, lying on the edge of the terrace, as usual, was reading the newspaper when M. Michel arrived, all alone. He is a tall, vigorous peasant, very thin, very tanned, a handsome intelligent head, the air of a soldier, wearing his uniform well, full of bearing and scrupulously clean in spite of the patched, mud-stained and faded sheet. . That pleased me. I wouldn't have liked Madame Michel's husband to be ill-kept. She deserves better. Maurice treats him like a very dear friend. They love each other, they esteem each other; it is visible. We felt them both so moved when they kissed!

He apologized for being alone.“The mother and the little one couldn't come today, Monsieur Maurice, but tomorrow they'll go up to La Cassolette to wish you good morning… Ah! that I still look at you! You don't look bad..."

He settled down near us and M. Serval, called by Maurice, joined us at once.

"Were you on the northern front all the time, Sergeant?" asked Roger.

'All the time, sir, since the beginning of the dance. Ah! good God ! what a filthy country! We wade through the mud, from morning to night… It's not a department for French people! And sad with that! and cold! and dirty! I could say a lot about this molasses, but I'd rather not.

"You've seen severe ones, Victor!"

- Of course, Mr. Maurice: we do not leave home to laugh, and I come back all the same without a scratch. »

I feared that, as the conversation took this path, he would soon allude to Roger's leg, thinking it was a wound. His wife had no doubt warned him (she has all the delicacies), for he said nothing, but later, at the urgent request of the "three cripples", he related his life at the front, hideous things, which cannot be written, and always in a tone of striking gaiety.

Mahoudiaux was laughing, my husband... my husband seemed mad with happiness, however one could read on his face still less happiness than madness, and Maurice noticed it because to change the conversation, he said to M. Serval:

“You should, dear friend, show us your sketch of Roger…”

And to M. Michel who wanted to go home:

"Can we see you at lunch tomorrow, old Victor, with Marie and the kid?" I count on it, don't I?

— Of course, Monsieur Maurice. »

He left and we went into the studio.

I have already spoken several times and at length about the three-pencil portrait that M. Serval made of me. I really liked this drawing; I like it more every day. He displeased Roger, I don't know why. His criticism was absurd and he never wanted to budge. I admired M. Serval's patience: he responded to Roger as one responds to a child who is sick and in a bad mood, whom one avoids scolding... but all that, I have already written, here, in my lavender notebook.

M. Serval therefore completed the sketch of an oil portrait of Roger. A very beautiful painting, oh! certainly, very beautiful! which does not prevent the fact that when I saw her, I wanted to fall into an armchair and cry hot tears. It was the face of Roger at the worst moments, at those horrible moments when something disturbing passes through his eyes, when he feels exiled among us, when he would like to be somewhere else, when he would like to be someone else and only manages to hurt himself.

Maurice's impression was certainly close to mine, but judging only the quality of the painting, he was able to congratulate M. Serval and even say to him: "My friend, provided that the finished work is comparable to the sketch, with a few portraits like this, you will become a great painter. »

Finally, Roger… At first he remained completely bewildered by his admiration; he couldn't take his eyes off that face in which he recognized himself too well; on his lips, in his eyes, there was a sort of stupid bewilderment that I had never seen in him, then… ah! I still keep in my ears the sound of his words, their accent, and I remember their disorder! He said weird, weird things. He was shaking all over his body and, a few moments later, in his room where we took him, he was seized with a fit of nerves, like a woman.

M. Serval and Maurice advised me to go and rest. The advice is wise; I will follow him. Yet the night is so beautiful! Earlier, M. Serval showed me the tints of the sky of a mysterious, deep blue. I would like to go out… Will I sleep, in my bed?

CHAPTER LII
I'm going back to Paris. Not that I'm bored at La Cassolette, nor that Mahoudiaux isn't a charming host, Lucienne Maxence the most delicious of friends and Cigogne a poor fellow very much to be pitied, but to continue this life, I would become neurasthenic and really it seems to me that half a madman is enough in a Provençal countryside by the sea.

Seeing Stork every day, treating him as one would treat an intelligent and sensible friend, leads to serious blunders, involuntary certainly, but which are no less dangerous. It annoys me, in the end, to turn my tongue three times in my mouth before saying anything and never knowing, even vaguely, how this bugger is going to react under the influence of an emotion, even -this the most everyday, the most banal.

Today, Victor Michel came to see us. We were all installed on the terrace, surrounded by the enchantment of the salty breeze and the innumerable perfume that filters through the pine wood. Cigogne, with shining eyes, questioned in a trembling voice the young sergeant, well uncoupled, of healthy, rustic and solid aspect, with lively eyes, whose presence seemed salutary for each of us.

“Sergeant! tell me about your existence there, Stork would ask. What idea can we get from the newspapers! We do not see things, and besides, how to describe the momentum of men without having seen and felt it, the noise of the cannon, without having heard it!... It is only by memory that we conveys those emotions.

- For sure ! and look, Sir, said Victor Michel, since you are talking about the momentum of the men, I remember one day when we charged... my men stopped dead in front of the enemy trench, with their bayonets a few centimeters from these brutes… It's no joke!… and it was necessary, how can I put it? they had to be trained again to get them inside, into Boche bellies… funny, isn't it, sir?

"Did you clear trenches too, Sergeant?"- Oh! yes, sir, very often, and, believe me, it's a strange job. We end up having fun killing the Boches, like children playing at war. We hit harder, that's all. And then it makes noise; they yell, it's a pleasure! We were told in catechism that in hell we shout loudly… we must shout the same thing as the Boches… And it stinks! and the blood sticks! what a piece of shit!... Excuse me, Madam!... Oh! if Marie heard me, how I would be scolded! »

But already Cigogne had his eyes out of his head. As much as Michel's raw and sincere enthusiasm displeased me little, so revolted me was Stork's, stammering and feverish.

Mahoudiaux's intervention cut short this scene which was in danger of turning out badly (Lucienne already felt like crying): as Victor Michel was taking his leave, he asked me to show my latest masterpiece, the sketch of the mouth of Stork. The sergeant went to join his wife and son; Lucienne, Cigogne and Mahoudiaux came to the studio, where I placed my canvas on a suitable day. - Good God ! why didn't I, at that moment, put my foot through it!

Opinions were divided. Lucienne, visibly, was sorry for my little job; Mahoudiaux paid me some big compliments, but I think he really liked it; as for Cigogne, he would not have said more if Latour, Ingres, Delacroix, Manet, Rembrandt and Veronese had held my brush! The fool! he believed that by this sketch I publicly confessed his sins! He ends up declaring, after other nonsense:

" It's me ! it's me in front of life, in front of a beautiful example of life, not very far away, but which must be reached. Will I be able to get there? The path is there, open under my feet, easy to follow and leading me where I want to go, removing me from the boredom of daily happiness, revealing to me the joy of true pleasure, of true glory, of true wisdom... Serval, you are an amazing painter, but why did I write so clearly in my eyes that the attempt remained absurd, that I was heading down a dead path... and that I suspected it! Serval, my comrade, you are tough! One does not forbid a penguin to pick fruit at the top of the tree; it is cruel to forbid obstacle courses to a cripple. Stop me from chasing a dream of wandering glory, my dream! when you see that I can't run,

He looked crazy. In his room where we had to take him back, he gave us the spectacle of a nervous breakdown, with cries and tears. Now he sleeps.

And, meanwhile, the sky was darkening marvelously, and the sea, and the silent woods were preparing for the great mute joy, warm and fragrant, of their sleep.

I hope that poor Lucienne can sleep, too.

I will leave before the end of the week.

CHAPTER III
" No ! said Mahoudiaux to me, on the terrace where we paced while smoking, we must not leave us, Serval; stay a few more days. I would be very sorry to see you leave now, and in this state of mind. I'd say to myself that you were bored at La Cassolette, that I was an awkward guest, that I couldn't hold you back, you whom I consider a friend. Come on, Serval, a good move! As for the other project, that of destroying the astonishing sketch that you have shown us, I do not ask you to give it up, I simply order you to do so (in violent terms, please to hear !). This canvas is already a beautiful thing and beautiful things should not be destroyed, especially for sentimental reasons. Serval, a second good move to pair with the first! … also to console me a little, because I am sad, worried, full of remorse for having invited Roger to La Cassolette. I adore this country, but isn't it dangerous for a sick mind, for a tormented sensibility? Would to Heaven that Roger only had one paw in poor condition! His head gives me more worries… Evenings that are too blue, twilights that are too shimmering, a sea that is too sparkling, woods that are too fragrant and those few nightingales that you have learned to cherish, aren't they very powerful emotional factors? ? If Roger leaves here even more disoriented than a few weeks ago, it's me alone who will have to be blamed, me who in all innocence offered him a sky, waves, trees and a library. which did not suit him at all!… And then, this boy is a box of surprises: everything he thinks, everything he feels, everything he does is unpredictable; one cannot guess where he lodged his soul to live the next moment. See how my friend Victor's story upset him! However, admit that these few sentences were nothing extraordinary: at the front, we have all seen horrible things, and with our own eyes.

'My dear Mahoudiaux,' I replied, 'it is precisely the sensitive point that you are touching here. Seeing with his own eyes is less dangerous for Cigogne and interests him less than seeing through the eyes of others.

"Victor Michel is coming to lunch today with his wife and son." I'll ask him to watch himself. Moreover, Marie being present, and the kid, I wager that he will speak in a softer mode. Does this rustic household please you?

— He delights me.'I took a delightful walk with the three of them this morning; little Maurice was off. You know I get up early, Serval, and if you weren't one of those deplorable Parisian painters who will never know the color of dawn, I would have taken you, but Monsieur was sleeping soundly while we walked Woods. I needed to relax, to look at all this around us, which is so beautiful, and even more beautiful early in the morning. We saw charming flowers, marine reflections… ah! my dear!... a peaceful, savory breeze was blowing, and this air was well suited to the particular beauty of this day... and nevertheless, M. Serval was sleeping in his featherbed... whose bedstead is, moreover, metallic.

"Maurice," I replied, "you are a rascal!" On such occasions, knock on my door, shake me, delicately place a sponge on my face. To walk in the morning, weather permitting, is better than sleeping, and now my leg allows me these joys.

- Agreed, my friend, but to wake you up, you still have to not leave! So you give up on these ridiculous projects?
