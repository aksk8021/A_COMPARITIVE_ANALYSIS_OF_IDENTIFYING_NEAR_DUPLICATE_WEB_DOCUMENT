“How happy a king were I, if I had many more such workmen and workwomen in my kingdom!  Their art and ability is excellent.  Let them know I will not forget them.  God’s blessing on their hearts, and painful hands.”

Such were the words and opinions of King Charles I., when speaking of the happy and industrious family whose life and labours at Little Gidding are described in the following pages, a family entirely devoted to good works, under the p. 6able direction of Mr. Nicholas Ferrar, whose history has happily been preserved for us with great accuracy, and which can hardly fail to be attractive.

Although Nicholas Ferrar and Little Gidding are names that are invariably associated with one another, it must not be imagined that he spent his whole life there.  It was not, indeed, till he was thirty-three years old that he left the busy and stirring scenes for which he seemed so suited; and before describing the twelve years of seclusion with which he ended his life, it is necessary to say something about his more active employments as a young man.  They prove beyond doubt that he was endued with abilities of the highest order, which might have led him to positions of great public importance had his inclinations so prompted him.

Nicholas Ferrar was born in the year 1592, his parents being conspicuous for their piety and charity, their conscientious discharge of every duty, and their careful training of a numerous family in every point of virtue and religion, special attention being paid to the study of the Bible, large portions of which were committed to memory.

Mr. Ferrar was a merchant, connected with all p. 7the great centres of commerce, especially with the East and West Indies; and being given to most generous hospitality, he was on friendly terms with many persons of eminence, such as Drake, Raleigh, and Hawkins.

Nicholas was the third son, and his talents began to develop themselves very early.  His memory, which was naturally very retentive, was carefully cultivated, and he was at all times eager and diligent in his studies.  At the age of fourteen he was admitted to Clare Hall, Cambridge; four years later he took his degree, and was before long elected to a Fellowship.  But his health now broke down, and it was considered that the only chance of his recovery lay in a complete change, and in leaving England.  Just at this time the Princess Elizabeth was starting for the Palatinate, after her marriage with the Elector Frederick, and Ferrar was fortunate in obtaining permission to be included in her suite.  They first went to Holland, but before long Ferrar left the Royal party, as he had resolved on seeing some places not included in the Royal programme.

We must, however, hurry over this part of Ferrar’s life, very interesting as it is, and it must suffice to say that in the course of five years he p. 8visited many parts of Germany and Italy, then went to the south of France, by sea to Spain, where he had several startling adventures, and after travelling five hundred miles alone, and on foot, reached Saint Sebastian, from which port he took ship to England.

The advantage of these travels to Ferrar was great in many ways.  He thoroughly mastered the languages of the various countries; he studied closely their forms of government, trade, and commerce, and acquired an insight even into the handicrafts of the people.  He made himself acquainted with the doctrines and discipline of the Churches and religious sects, and procured, whenever he could do so, the assistance of the ablest scholars to instruct him.  Being well supplied with money by his father, he was enabled to collect, besides other things, a great number of prints and engravings by all the best masters; in fact, it is stated that he let nothing of this sort escape him that was valuable; and being all relative to, or illustrative of, passages in the Bible, they were utilized to great advantage when in his later years he compiled “The Harmonies.”

On his return home, his natural inclination was to settle at Cambridge and resume his work at p. 9Clare Hall; but, partly owing to his father’s advanced age, and partly on account of his elder brother having important work in London in connection with the Virginia Plantation Company, Nicholas Ferrar determined to settle there with them.  Here he soon attracted much attention for his many eminent qualities, reports of which had, indeed, been received from abroad, and before long Sir Edwyn Sandys and Lord Southampton, both of them governors of the Virginia Company, having discovered for themselves his great worth, proposed him as King’s Counsel for the Plantation.  He thus became deeply engaged in public business; and as his work was continually produced in open court, his reputation increased more and more.  Two or three years later his powers were still further tested, for the Spanish party exerted all their influence to overthrow the Company; and as Nicholas Ferrar was at this time the deputy-governor, the chief burden of the defence fell on his shoulders.  His efforts were, however, all in vain, and before long the patent or charter was withdrawn, and the Company was dissolved, owing to the false accusations brought against the managers and directors.

Ferrar was now elected Member of Parliament, p. 10and was able to bring before the House and the public more fully the iniquity of these proceedings, and by his skilful management cleared the directors, and brought their opponents to justice and punishment.

This was the concluding act of Ferrar’s public life, and we shall now turn to a scene of a vastly different nature.  But it has been necessary to say thus much to exhibit in its true light the force of character, the wonderful diligence and activity of the man, who (as we shall now see) decided on devoting the rest of his life to religious exercises, to works of charity and usefulness, but living apart and without interruption from the busy world.

There is evidence to show that this had long been his wish, in fact, that from his earliest years some such ideas had been in his mind; but until now he had not seen his way to carry them out.

The first and most necessary step was to find a place suitable for his purpose, and hearing that the lordship of Little Gidding was for sale, he went to inspect it.

It was in an obscure part of the county of Huntingdon, a large manor house and a cottage for shepherds the only buildings, with the exception p. 11of a dilapidated church used as a barn.  The air was healthy, and the whole estate lay in pasture.

The spot seemed admirably adapted to his designs, and was accordingly bought; and after settling his own business and also his brother’s, he moved to Little Gidding in the year 1625.

He now gathered round him a very large family party.  His father was dead, but his mother, his brother, and his sister, who was married to a Mr. Collett, with the children of both families, all joined under the one roof.  When the establishment was completed and in proper working order, it is said that they numbered forty persons, including schoolmasters and servants.

The meeting between Nicholas Ferrar and his mother, who was now 73 years old, is so characteristic that it must be related.  Within three or four days of his arrival, and before the necessary repairs had been carried out, Mrs. Ferrar rides to Gidding from her daughter’s home, no great distance off.  Nicholas Ferrar meets her outside the manor house, and kneeling on the ground, asks and receives her blessing.  He then entreats her to enter his dwelling and repose herself after the journey.

“Not so,” she says; “yonder I see the church, let us first go there and give thanks to God.”

p. 12She is told she cannot even get inside the door, for there had been no time as yet to clear out the hay which was in it.  But she persists in her resolve, and thrusting herself in a little way, she kneels and prays.  Then sending for the workmen employed in the house, the hay is flung out of the windows, and the church is cleansed as well as might be for the present, and till this is done she will not set foot in her new home.

The following year, 1626, Nicholas Ferrar returned to London for a short while to dispose of his house and bid good-bye to his friends.  He now was able to carry out a resolution, which it is believed he had made long before, and was ordained Deacon by Dr. Laud, the future Archbishop of Canterbury.  Many people imagined that this was to enable him to seek ecclesiastical preferments, and several valuable livings were soon offered to him; but his sole object was that he might have the necessary authority to carry on the spiritual work of his own home, and thus be of greater use to his family.

He had doubtless by now worked out the general plan of life, and put his house and the church into proper order.  Certain glebe lands and tithes which had been alienated from their p. 13rightful owners were restored; and to prove the honesty of his purpose he even pulled down a very large dovecote upon the premises, which contained a great number of pigeons.  The reason for this was that all his property was laid out as pasture, and therefore the pigeons fed on his neighbours’ corn-fields.  In the place of the dovecote he made a school-house, and permission was given to the people of the towns and villages within reach to send their children to be instructed under his supervision, and without payment or expense.  For this purpose he provided three resident masters; one was to teach English to the poor children and Latin to his nephews and nieces, another superintended the writing and arithmetic, while the third was for instruction in the theory and practice of music.

There was also especial inducement held out to all children of the neighbourhood to learn the Psalms by heart.  Each one was given a Psalter, and had to go to Gidding on Sunday mornings to repeat his portion learnt during the week.  There were sometimes more than a hundred children, and they were given a penny for each Psalm learnt, and a dinner served in the great hall.

p. 14It will be as well now to describe in detail the “particular and more punctual actions of each day in the week,” which we get with great exactness from the records left us by John Ferrar.  To begin with Sunday—early rising was encouraged on this day, as throughout the week, namely, five o’clock in winter and four o’clock in summer.  The younger children first assembled in the great hall, where was always a good warm fire in the winter.  Here they found Nicholas Ferrar awaiting them, to whom they repeated such chapters or Psalms as they had been given to learn.  After this they returned to their rooms to make themselves “more comely in their best attires.”  Breakfast, and private reading or conversation in their own rooms, went on till nine o’clock, when the bell called them together again.  They all met in the great hall, and, having sung a hymn, proceeded in decent order to the church.

The three schoolmasters led the way, wearing their black gowns, the youths (also in gowns) following two and two, John Ferrar and Mr. Collett came next, and then Nicholas Ferrar leading his aged mother; immediately behind her came Mrs. Collett and the daughters, and the procession closed with all the servants.

p. 15Each as they came into church made a low obeisance, and took up their allotted places; Nicholas Ferrar, in surplice and hood, saying the service.  This over, the “Psalm children” went to the manor house and repeated their Psalms.

At half-past ten they went to the church again, when the minister of the neighbouring parish came for the Communion Service and to preach.  That done, dinner was served in the house, first for the “Psalm children”—old Mrs. Ferrar herself very often bringing in the first dish—and afterwards for the rest of the family.

Recreation or walking in the garden was permitted till two o’clock, when the bell called them together again for evening service at the nearest parish church.  Supper-time was five or six o’clock, and while it was being prepared the organ was played in the great hall and an anthem was sung.  After supper each one could occupy himself as he wished, indoors or walking abroad, or “passing the time with good discourse.”  At eight o’clock there was more singing to the organ, followed by prayers, and then the children, after asking the “old gentlewoman’s” blessing, all bid each good night.

Mr. Ferrar also made it his special care that no p. 16work in the house should prevent the servants attending church; there were none left behind; and on the Sundays when the Holy Communion was administered, “the servants that had feasted with them in the church were not thought unworthy to eat with them in the parlour,” sitting at the end of the same table.

It would be tedious and uninteresting to attempt to follow the week-day employments in the exact order in which they were carried out, but the general plan may be given with advantage, as illustrating the principles inculcated at Gidding.

The day began early—at four or five o’clock—by the children repeating to Mr. Ferrar what they had learnt by heart the day before.  At six o’clock the recitation of the Psalms began, and it was so planned that “certain members of the family repeated certain Psalms at every hour of the day, every one knowing his turn and hour of attendance; and thus, without undue interruption of other work, the whole book of Psalms was repeated once in the twenty-four hours.”  In addition to this, the children had to say one of the chapters of the Concordance, or Harmony of the Four Evangelists, which was arranged purposely by p. 17Nicholas Ferrar, so that it might be gone through once in every month.

Three times during the day the bell rang to summon them for a short service in the church, on each occasion the proceeding being as described for Sunday.

Every hour of the day had some special employment, some of the children sitting in the great hall watched by Mrs. Ferrar, some in the new school-house with the masters.  Their occupations were as varied as possible: English, Latin, and other languages, writing and ciphering, and learning by heart being interspersed with singing, playing the organ, and other instruments, making the Concordances, bookbinding and gilding, and embroidery.  At stated times the boys were encouraged in active outdoor exercises, running, leaping, and archery.  As the girls grew up they were made to perfect themselves in good housewifery.  A month at a time each one had control of the housekeeping, all expenditure being carefully booked; at the end of the month her accounts were looked over, and her duties handed on to the next in rotation.

A room was set apart as an infirmary for any member of the family who might require nursing, p. 18and another room for the reception of any poor person who might be brought in sick or hurt.  The ladies were taught to dress their wounds, and to do all things necessary for their relief, but the prescribing of medicines Mr. Ferrar kept for himself, as he had many years studied this science.  They distilled “cordial waters,” and kept in the dispensary a good supply of balsams, oils, and all things needful for the cure of their patients.

At meal times the custom prevailed of reading aloud, the person whose turn it might be, first having some light food, and after the reading was finished, “in regard of his forbearance, always having the advantage of some more food than his fellows!”

The reading was to be something “delightful and easy, such as stories of sea voyages, descriptions of foreign countries, their rise and fall, and illustrated by the particular actions of eminent persons.”  And in order that these stories might not be forgotten, it was further arranged that notes (or “a summary collection”) should be taken of everything worthy of attention, and that these notes should afterwards be transcribed, and put into language fitted to the capacity of the children, who then had, in turn, to recite the stories.  This p. 19practice brought the boys into a habit of delivering any speech with assurance and good manner, and of expressing themselves in a becoming and elegant style.

They also became thoroughly acquainted with ancient and modern history, and knew and understood the great affairs of life better than many who lived more in the world.

Analogous to this, and no doubt a development of it, were “The maiden-sisters exercises.”  These were conversations or dialogues recited by the Miss Colletts, illustrative of some special virtue, and always enforced by examples taken from history.

The sisters, for this purpose, were known by such titles as The Patient, The Cheerful, The Affectionate, etc., and formed themselves into what they called “The Little Academy,” of which Mary Collett was “The Chief,” Mrs. Collett was called “The Moderator,” John Ferrar “The Guardian,” and Nicholas Ferrar “The Visitor.”

The subjects and the substance of the exercises were supplied by Nicholas Ferrar himself, but the sisters were left to compile them in their own words.  They were prepared some time beforehand, and after they had been recited were transcribed into books kept for the purpose.

p. 20Four folio volumes of these “conversations” are still in existence, and are, no doubt, in the handwriting of Mary and Ann Collett.  They are bound in black leather, stamped with gilt lines, and with gilt edges, and have been passed on from one member of the family to another to the present owner, a Mr. Mapletoft Davis, living in Australia. [20]

Some idea of the general plan of these “exercises” may be gathered from the following notes taken from the manuscripts.

The first meeting of the “Little Academy” was on Ash Wednesday, 1630, when the subject was “The Folly of Delaying Repentance.”  The next meeting was on Easter Monday, a speech being made on “Happiness,” illustrated by stories of King Philip of Spain, King Henry IV. of France, and Popes Marcellus and Adrian.  On other occasions the following subjects were selected: “Humility towards God, and moderation to equals and enemies is most beneficial,” illustrated by stories of Charles V.; “We must overcome evil with good,” illustration, John of Alexandria, etc., etc.

At first it seems that the recitations were given on five festivals, which days naturally provided p. 21suitable subjects, and afterwards it was decided to increase the number to twelve days, and they pass the following resolution: “Every day must handle a new matter, that’s the injunction; and because the days afford not any special occasion, the particular names imposed on us shall be the subjects successively of our several exercises.”  The titles were (1) “The Chief” (who chose for her subject “Humility”); (2) The Patient; (3) The Affectionate; (4) The Cheerful; (5) The Submiss; (6) The Obedient; (7) The Moderate.  Generally the conversations were enlivened by music and singing, but when the subject was “Patience” this was omitted, and there was much less anecdote.  The discourse was also somewhat longer, so that the virtue which was being illustrated was at the same time practically enforced.  It is not quite clear how long the exercises were continued, but in the second volume of the manuscripts it is stated that many home troubles had helped to break up the “Little Academy,” especially old Mrs. Ferrar’s death, which was in the year 1634, and that the actors were reduced to three, when their cousin, young Nicholas Ferrar, “took upon himself to revive their antient practises.”  But after this the actors all appear with fresh names.

p. 22Not content with the most careful and minute regulations for the employment of every hour of the day in some secular or religious matter, (for we read that “every hour had its company for the performance of some special duty,”) Nicholas Ferrar further arranged that those so inclined should pursue their devotional exercises also at night.  Two were to watch together in a room set apart for the purpose; the womankind had a room at one side of the house, and the men had one on the other side.  The watching lasted from 9 p.m. till 1 a.m., and during those four hours the whole of the Book of Psalms was said over carefully, verse by verse, alternately.

Mr. Ferrar himself generally watched twice in the week, the others never more than once; and in the winter special precautions were taken to prevent them suffering from cold.

At one o’clock, when the watch was finished, they lay down till six o’clock, but did not actually go to bed at all, as on other nights.

It was apparently some account of the “Harmonies of the Four Evangelists” which first attracted King Charles’ attention to the family living at Gidding, and about the year 1631, being not far off with his Court, he sent a gentleman to p. 23ask for the loan of the book.  This was conceded with some hesitation, and the King, having once got it into his hands, would not part with it again, until he had obtained a promise that another similar volume should be made for him.  The work was promptly executed, and may now be seen in the British Museum.

The careful study of the Harmonies or Concordances is most interesting, and even in these modern times one at least is used daily as a means of instruction for the children of the family where the book has an honoured home, in much the same manner as the children at Little Gidding used it two hundred and fifty years ago.

No more need be said about the Harmonies here, as a full account of the manner of their construction and the history and resting-place of all the specimens that can be heard of at the present time will be related in another chapter.But in close connection with the making of the Concordances must be mentioned the art of bookbinding, and embroidered covers for books, as well as embroidery for other purposes.

The Concordances are all bound in velvet or leather, and are nearly all stamped with designs in gold, on much the same plan.  The stamps chiefly p. 24used are fleurs-de-lis, acorns, sprigs of oak, etc., and the amount of ornamentation appears to depend upon the rank of the person for whom the book was intended, and also partly upon the date when the book was made, the earlier copies being much less elaborate than the later volumes.

It is also evident that books printed in the ordinary way were bound, or re-bound, at Gidding.  One of the most remarkable of which there is any authentic account is a large folio Bible, printed by Barker, of London, in the year 1639.  It now belongs to the Marquis of Bute, and, as a rule, is in his library at Cardiff; but he is most kind in allowing it to be exhibited, and it has recently been shown at Bath, and before that at Glasgow.  The binding is of blue silk, elaborately decorated with designs in gilt and silver thread, and in the centre are the royal arms and initials C. R., which prove clearly enough for whom the work was originally done.  A competent authority, one of the great professional connoisseurs, has declared the binding to be one of the most magnificent specimens with which he is acquainted.

It would ill-befit one of the ruder sex to attempt to write critically about the needlework of the maidens of Gidding, but we may sing their praises p. 25for the skill, the industry, and the artistic results exhibited by this branch of their daily occupations.

The specimen most easily examined by any one wishing to do so, is a cover for a dressing-case in the South Kensington Museum; another similar piece of work was lent by a gentleman in London to an exhibition in Dublin a few years ago; he kindly supplied the information afterwards that he had been for many years a collector and admirer of the Gidding needlework, and had one or two Bible covers and some other pieces of their embroidery in his possession.

A gentleman at Brighton has also a small 32mo New Testament, printed by R. Barker, of London, a.d. 1640, which has a Gidding embroidered cover.  The design is a simple floral pattern worked in fine close stitches on white silk, with a foundation of coarse canvas or holland, which was perhaps glued on to the original boards.  He has also a portrait of Charles I. made in the same kind of stitch on a satin ground, but it is not certain whether this was worked at Gidding or not.  A great deal of needlework of that date is wrongly attributed to the Miss Collets.

An altar cloth, shown at Dublin in 1888, was also stated to be their work, and it is extremely p. 26probable that they would have done such things, for it is mentioned “that they were expert with their needles, and made them serve the altar and the poor.”

In making the embroidery it would appear as if the pattern was first drawn on paper, then cut out, and finally worked over, the designs being for the most part in somewhat high relief.

It is worthy of remark that, almost invariably, whenever this embroidery is put up for sale or is exhibited, it is marked as the work of the “Nuns of Little Gidding.”  Now, it may be said that all those who at the present day take any interest in the life, methods, or work of Nicholas Ferrar and his nieces, do so with feelings of admiration, and are, at least, not to be numbered amongst their detractors.  Yet it is curious how the one name which helped more than anything else to work their ruin is even now, as a rule, attached to them.  Within a few years of Nicholas Ferrar’s death, some of his enemies had a pamphlet printed and distributed “not by hundreds, but by thousands, and given into the hands of the parliament men as they went daily to the House of Commons.”  The title was, “The Arminian Nunnery; a description of the newly erected Monastical Place, or the p. 27Arminian Nunnery at Little Gidding.”  The books were also given to the Puritan soldiers when near Gidding to excite them to offer violence to the family.  But why should the title “Nuns of Little Gidding” be still the name most often given to the Miss Colletts?  Few persons can realize that it is the name invented by their enemies, earnestly repudiated by themselves, and entirely devoid of truth.

This may be proved in several ways.  The house at Little Gidding contained two married families, the boys and girls all growing up together.  The girls were purposely trained in such domestic matters as would fit them for good wives, and five of them did eventually marry.  The two eldest alone, having reached the ages of thirty and thirty-two, resolved to remain unmarried, but in no way took vows.  Nicholas Ferrar himself was once taxed with having started a “nunnery,” and replied that the name of “nuns” was odious, and declared himself against such vows of single life with great earnestness.

Again, a visitor to Little Gidding, describing the place and the family, says, “I saluted the mother and daughter not like nuns, but as we salute other women.”

p. 28Probably when the phrase “Nuns of Little Gidding” is used at the present time, it is used in no reproachful sense; but the name is misleading, and should be avoided, if for no other reason, because it was invented by the enemies of Mr. Ferrar’s family and objected to by themselves.

The family, as a matter of fact, were by no means recluses; they went about amongst their neighbours, and were “very well reported of by all who knew them.”  They purposely selected a quiet part of the country to live in, that they might not be interrupted in their manifold employments; but they appear to have been always ready to receive visitors, and to treat them with hospitality.

Ferrar’s rules for his own life were certainly somewhat austere, and as time went on he increased its rigour, more especially after his mother’s death; but he never enforced on others what he did himself, and every hour of the day appears to have been spent usefully and happily.

It may be interesting to give here the opinions of some of his more notable friends.  Mention has already been made of the important persons he lived amongst in his public life, and besides them at this time there was Dr. Laud the Archbishop, p. 29who was so delighted to ordain “such a man as he never had before nor believed he ever should again.”  There was Dr. Williams the Bishop of the Diocese, who often went to Gidding and “much magnified all that Nicholas and Mrs. Ferrar had done;” and not to mention others, there was George Herbert, “his very dear brother,” who, “seeing he could not draw Gidding any nearer to him, he would draw nearer to his brother Ferrar,” and was endeavouring to exchange his living merely to carry out this wish.  These two good men were indeed very similar in their religious views; they “loved and trusted one another most entirely, and drove a large stock of Christian intelligence together,” and when George Herbert died, he sent his manuscripts to Ferrar to publish or to withhold, as he thought right.  Chief amongst them were the poems now such favourites in many a house.  These, when Ferrar had many and many a time read over, he kissed and embraced them again and again, saying, “they were most worthy to be in the hands and hearts of all true Christians that feared God and loved the Church of England.”

The words of the Royal Friend who once or twice visited Gidding in person stand at the p. 30commencement of this sketch, and sufficiently prove what was his estimate of Ferrar and his works.

It may be easily conjectured, however, that this unusual life, conducted by a man so well known as Ferrar, attracted a great deal of attention—and that in the days when religious differences prevailed to a sad extent, there were many persons eager enough not only to find fault, but to misrepresent what was done by this family; who, to say the least, did a great deal of good to their poorer neighbours, and did harm to no one.  But a closer acquaintance with Mr. Ferrar generally dispelled the calumnies which report had spread of him and his ways.  And one gentleman who went to Gidding purposely to make out their case as bad as possible, came away full of their praises.

In the end, however, their enemies prevailed; for the Puritan soldiers (about the time of King Charles’s death) did drive the family away, ransacked the church, plundered the house, and destroyed many very valuable books and manuscripts, and, in fact, everything that had been left behind in a somewhat hasty flight.  It is related that the organ excited their anger more than anything, and that they relieved their feelings by p. 31breaking it up, setting it on fire, and then roasting some of Mr. Ferrar’s sheep over it.

But he was not spared to see these distressful times himself, as he died in December, 1637, having lived at Gidding about twelve years.  The accounts of his last illness are very interesting, as throwing a strong light on his intensely religious character.  In November, 1637, on his return from the little church, he had an attack of faintness, and never afterwards left the house.  He knew from the first that he would not recover, and said to those around him, “In former sickness I have had a strong desire to live, and an earnestness to pray to my God to spare me, which He hath to this day done, when all hopes of life were past by the judgments of the most skilful physicians; and I may further say to the Glory of His great name, I never earnestly set myself to beg of God anything, but He fulfilled the petition of His most unworthy servant.  But now and of late, I have not, nor do not find in my heart any inclination to beg longer life.”

During his illness he continually exhorted the family that they should “constantly adhere to the doctrine of the Church of England, and to continue in the good old way;” he forewarned them of p. 32coming oppositions and of danger and trouble, and urged them to shrink not to rely on God, to serve Him with soul and body, for “He made both, and both must worship Him in sincerity of devotion.”  “He will have both inward love, and outward reverence of body and gesture.”

About three days before his death, he made John Ferrar mark out the place for his grave seven feet from the west end of the church, leaving space for his elder brother’s grave nearest the church.  He then directed that all the books of comedies, tragedies, love-hymns, etc. (three great hampers full, which had been locked up for many years), should be burnt on the place marked for his grave.  There were many hundreds in various languages, which he had collected when a young man, but which he had abjured as dangerous, full of idolatry, and apt to undermine the Christian religion.

He retained full power of mind, and suffered no pain throughout the whole illness, and passed away at one o’clock on the Sunday night, the very hour that he constantly rose up every morning to praise God, and to pray unto Him.

The family carried on all the good works in the which they had been instructed, until they were driven away by the military zealots of the Puritan p. 33party; but in later and more peaceful times they again assembled in the old home, though there is no authentic account of the date, nor of the particular members of the family that returned; but their exile does not appear to have been of long duration, as there are entries in the register of Gidding church, and inscriptions on brasses or tombstones, which record events in the family history of the Ferrars and Collets (such as baptisms and burials) as early as the year 1650—and at frequent dates afterwards.  The Gidding estate, which had originally been bought by old Mrs. Ferrar, passed to her eldest son John, which is proved by his being described on his tombstone as “Lord of this Manor,” and he was succeeded by his eldest son, who was resident there in the year 1715, as stated by Dr. Mapletoft in one of the Concordances.
