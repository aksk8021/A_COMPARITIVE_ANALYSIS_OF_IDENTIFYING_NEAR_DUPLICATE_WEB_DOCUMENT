Edmond-François-Valentin About, the author of the accompanying story, was born at Dieuze, in Lorraine, on February 14, 1828. He followed the course of the French schools and in time was graduated from the École Normale , whence his taste for classical studies led him to the French school at Athens. In 1853, About returned to Paris and began to write for the newspapers, especially for the Moniteur , Figaro , and Soir , and shortly after, in 1855, he published La Greece contemporaine , a bright, though hardly just satire on the manners and customs of the people he had just left.

In the same year appeared About's first novel, Tolla , and although forced to withstand the accusation of plagiarism in this work, the following decade was the most fruitful of our author's life, the period in which he produced almost all of the novels and stories to which he owes his fame. The chief of these works are: Le Roi des Montagnes , 1856; The Marriages of Paris , 1856; Germaine , 1857; Thirty and Forty , 1858; The Man with the Broken Ear , 1861; The Nose of a Notary , 1862; The Case of M. Guérin , 1862; and Madelon , 1863. The Novel of a Brave Mandid not appear until 1880. During these years About also tried the dramatic field, but without success.

In the meantime the emperor, Napoleon the Third, had learned to appreciate this quick and ready pen and was beginning to make large use of it for political purposes. The resulting newspaper articles in support of the government very soon made their author a favorite at court and he was, more, liberally rewarded and encouraged in his work.

At this age About had no deep political sympathies, he supported the imperial policy because he was well paid for his writings, but in 1870 the mismanagement of the Franco-Prussian war opened his eyes to the shortcomings and deficiencies of the Bonapartist government and he became an ardent Republican. He lost no time in giving up his literary work that he might devote his whole energy to journalism in the endeavor to advance the cause of his party, and in company with Francisque Sarcey he founded the republican journal, Le XIX e Siècle . Already under the empire About had been a violent anti-clerical, having published as early as 1859 La Question romaine, against Romish influence in France, and he now turned his particular attention to combating the Church of Rome in its relation to the republican government.

In 1884, Edmond About was elected to the Academy, but before he could be formally installed death overtook him, on January 17, 1885.

The characteristics of About's literary style appear as clearly in La Mère de la Marquise , which is included in Les Mariages de Paris , as in any of the author's longer works; we may briefly enumerate these characteristics as facility and variety of expression, a ready wit, a large and varied vocabulary, and the ability to sketch characters in a few, bold strokes. About's stories are written to entertain, they are bright and wholesome, they tell an interesting story in a straightforward manner, and beneath all is just serious enough satire to lend a pleasing proportion and balance to the whole.

In preparing this edition of La Mère de la Marquise the editor has sought to present a text, with vocabulary, suitable for students of French in the second year of the high-school course or in the first year at college. The story itself has been chosen on account of its quick action, the graceful and witty turn of the phrases, the easy, colloquial style, and the entire freedom from coarseness. The text is that of the last edition of Les Mariages de Paris , Paris, 1899; it is reproduced with the omission of only a very few extracts hardly suited to the class-room.

THE MARQUISE'S MOTHER
I
This is an old story that will date back ten years or so.

On April 15, 1846, one read in all the great newspapers of Paris the following announcement:

“A young man of good family, a former pupil of a government school,[1] having studied mining, smelting, blacksmithing, accounting and the exploitation of timber for ten years, would like to find an honorable job in his specialty. To write[2] in Paris, poste restante, at MLMDO»

The owner of the fine forges of Arlange, Madame Benoît, was then in Paris, in her little hotel in the rue Saint-Dominique; but she never read the newspapers. Why would she read them? She was not looking for an employee for her forge, but a husband for her daughter.

Madame Benoît, whose mood and appearance have changed a great deal over the past ten years, was at that time a very amiable person. She deliciously enjoyed that second youth which nature does not grant to all women, and which lasts between the fortieth and fiftieth years. Her somewhat majestic plumpness gave her the appearance of a flower in full bloom, but no one, seeing her, thought of a faded flower. Her little eyes sparkled with the same fire as when she was twenty; her hair had not turned white, her teeth had not grown longer; her cheeks and chin shone with that vigorous, glistening, downless freshness which distinguishes the second youth from the first. Her arms and shoulders would have been the envy of many young women. His foot is

The insides of such an accomplished person corresponded exactly to the outside. Madame Benoît's mind was as sharp as her eyes. Her face was no more radiant than her character. Laughter never dried up on that pretty mouth; her beautiful little hands were always open to give. His soul seemed made of good humor and good will. To those who marveled at such sustained gaiety and such universal benevolence, Mme Benoît replied: “What do you want?[3] I was born happy. My past contains nothing but pleasant, save a few long-forgotten hours; the present is like a cloudless sky; as for the future, I am sure of it, I hold it. You see that you would have to be mad to complain about fate or take a dislike to the human race!

As there is nothing perfect in this world, Madame Benoît had a fault, but an innocent fault, which had never hurt anyone but herself. She was, though ambition seems a privilege of the ugly sex, passionately ambitious. I regret not having found another word to express his only failing; for, to tell the truth, Madame Benoît's ambition had nothing in common with that of other men. It aimed neither at fortune nor at honours: the forges of Arlange fairly regularly brought in an income of one hundred and fifty thousand francs; and, as for the rest, Madame Benoît was not a woman to accept anything from the government of 1846.[4] What was she after? Very little. So little that you wouldn't understand me if I didn't first recount in a few lines the youth of Mme Benoît née Lopinot.

Gabrielle-Auguste-Éliane Lopinot was born in the heart of the faubourg[5] Saint-Germain, on the banks of this blessed stream[6] of the rue du Bac, which Madame de Staël preferred to all the rivers of Europe. His parents, bourgeois to the chin, sold novelties under the sign of Bon Saint Louis ,[7] and silently accumulated a colossal fortune. Their well-known principles, their enthusiasm for the monarchy and the respect they displayed for the nobility kept them the clientele of the whole faubourg. M. Lopinot, as a learned supplier, never sent a note[8] than he would have been asked to do. We have never heard that he sued a recalcitrant debtor. Also the descendants of the Crusaders often went bankrupt at Bon Saint Louis ; but those who pay, pay for others. This estimable merchant, surrounded by illustrious people, some of whom robbed him and others allowed themselves to be robbed, gradually came to uniformly despise his noble clientele. We saw him very humble and very respectful in the store; but he rose as if by spring on returning home. He astonished his wife and daughter by the freedom of his judgments and the audacity of his maxims. Madame Lopinot was very close to crossing herself[9] devoutly when she heard him say after drinking:[10] “I am very fond of the marquises, and they seem to me to be good people; but at no price would I want a marquis for son-in-law.”

It wasn't Gabrielle-Auguste-Éliane's account.[11] She would have made the best of a[12]marquis, and, since each of us must play a role in this world, she gave preference to the role of marquise. This child, accustomed to seeing carriages pass by like little peasants to seeing swallows fly, had lived in perpetual dazzle. Driven to infatuation, like all young girls, she had admired the objects around her: hotels, horses, toilets and liveries. At the age of twelve, a great name exercised a kind of fascination on his ear; at fifteen, she felt seized with a profound respect for what is called the Faubourg Saint-Germain, that is to say, for that incomparable aristocracy which believes itself superior to all mankind by right of birth. When she was old enough to get married, the first idea that came to her was that a stroke of fortune could bring her into those hotels whose carriage entrance she gazed at, seat her next to those tall, radiant ladies whom she dared not look in the face, involve her in those conversations she believed to be more witty than the most beautiful books and more interesting than the best novels. After all, she thought, it doesn't take a great miracle to lower the impassable barrier before me. It is enough for my face or my dowry to conquer a count, a duke or a marquis. His ambition was aimed above all at the marquisate, and for good reason. There are dukes and counts of recent creation who are not received in the faubourg; while all the marquises without exception are of the old rock, because since Molière one does not make any more.

I guess if she had been on her own she would have found without a lantern[13] the man she wanted for a husband. But she lived under her mother's wing, in profound solitude, where M. Lopinot came from time to time to offer her the hand of an attorney, a notary, or a stockbroker. She disdainfully refused all parties until 1829. But one fine morning she realized that she was twenty-five years old, and she suddenly married M. Morel, ironmaster at Arlange. He was an excellent commoner, whom she would have loved like a marquis if she had had the time. But he died on July 31, 1830, six months after the birth of his daughter. The beautiful widow was so outraged at the July Revolution,[14] that she almost forgot to mourn her husband. The embarrassments of the succession and the care of the forges kept her in Arlange until the cholera of 1832,[15] who took away his father and his mother in a few days. She then returned to Paris, sold the Bon Saint Louis , and bought her mansion in the Rue Saint-Dominique, between the Comte de Preux and the Maréchale de Lens. She established herself with her daughter in her new home, and it was not without a secret joy that she saw herself lodged in a hotel of noble appearance, between a count and a marshal. Its furnishings were richer than those of its neighbours, its greenhouse larger, its horses better bred and its carriages better suspended. However, she would have willingly given a greenhouse, furniture, horses and carriages to have the right to be near neighbors a bit. The walls of her garden were no more than four meters high, and on quiet summer evenings she heard people talking,[16]sometimes with the Count, sometimes with the Marshal. Unfortunately he was not allowed to take part in the conversation. One morning his gardener brought him an old cockatoo he had taken from a tree. She blushed with pleasure on recognizing the marshal's parrot. She did not want to yield to anyone the pleasure of returning this beautiful bird to her mistress, and, at the risk of having her hands torn to pieces with her beak, she carried it back herself. But she was received by a fat steward who thanked her with dignity on the doorstep. A few days later, the children of the Comte de Preux sent a brand new balloon to his flowerbeds. The fear of being thanked by a steward caused her to send the ball back to the Countess by one of her servants, with a very witty letter and the most aristocratic turn. It was the children's tutor, a real pedant, who answered him. The pretty widow (she was then in the fullness of her beauty) was in favor of his advances.[17] She sometimes said to herself in the evening, on returning home: “The fate is very ridiculous! I have the right to enter as much as I want at number 57, and I am not allowed to enter for a quarter of an hour at number 59 or 55!” Her only acquaintances in the world of the faubourg were some of her father's debtors, from whom she was careful not to ask for money.[18] As a reward for her discretion, these honorable people sometimes received her in the morning.[19] At noon, she could undress: all her visits were made.

The manager of the forge tore her from this intolerable life by calling her back to her business. Arrived at Arlange, she found there what she had sought in vain in all Paris: the key to the Faubourg Saint-Germain.[20] One of his country neighbors had been hosting Mr. le Marquis for three months[21] of Kerpry , captain in the 2nd regiment of dragoons. The Marquis was a man of forty, a bad officer, a bon vivant, always green, insured against old age, and famous for his debts, his duels, and his pranks. Moreover, rich in his pay, that is to say, excessively poor. “I hold my marquisate!” thought the beautiful Eliane. She paid court to the marquis, and the marquis did not hold it against her. Two months later he sent in his resignation to the Ministry of War and took M. Morel's widow to church. In accordance with the law, the marriage was displayed in the commune of Arlange, in the 10th arrondissement of Paris, and in the last garrison of the captain . The birth certificate[22] of the groom, drafted under the Terror, bore only the vulgar name of Benoît, but an act of public notoriety was attached to it attesting that within living memory[23] Mr. Benoît was known as the Marquis de Kerpry.

The new marquise began by opening her salons in the neighboring Faubourg Saint-Germain, for the faubourg extended to the frontiers of France.

After having dazzled all the squires in the neighborhood with her luxury, she wanted to go to Paris to take her revenge on the past; and she related this project to her husband. The captain frowned and declared clearly that he was indeed in Arlange. The cellar was good, the cuisine to his taste, the hunting magnificent; he asked for nothing more. The Faubourg Saint-Germain was for him a country as new as America: there he had neither relatives, nor friends, nor acquaintances. "God's goodness! cried poor Eliane, "must I have come across the only Marquis on earth who doesn't know the Faubourg Saint-Germain!"It wasn't his only setback. She soon found that her husband was taking absinthe four times a day, not to mention another liquor called vermouth which he had brought from Paris for his personal use. The captain's reason did not always resist these repeated libations, and when he broke his common sense, it was most often to fly into a rage. His liveliness spared no one, not even Eliane, who came to wish all good[24] to no longer be a marquise. This event happened sooner than she expected.

One day the captain was ill from having behaved too well the day before. He had a heavy head and sunken eyes. Seated in the largest armchair in the living room, he was melancholy polishing his long red mustaches. His wife, standing beside a samovar, was pouring him huge cups of tea one after the other. A servant announced the Earl of Kerpry. The captain, ill as he was, suddenly rose to his feet.

"Didn't you tell me you were parentless?" asked Eliane, a little surprised.

"I didn't know myself,[25] answered the captain, and I want the devil to take me... But we will see. Bring in!”

The captain smiled disdainfully when he saw a young man of twenty, of almost childlike beauty, appear. He was of reasonable height, but so frail and so delicate, that one could believe that he had not finished growing. His long blue eyes gazed around them with a sort of fierce shyness. When he caught sight of the beautiful Eliane, his face flushed like a peach on an espalier.[26] The timbre of her voice was soft, fresh, limpid, almost feminine. If it weren't for the brown mustache that stood out finely on his lip, one might have taken him for a young girl disguised as a man.

“Monsieur,” he said to the captain, half turning towards Eliane, “although I do not have the honor of being known to you, I have come to talk to you about family business. Our conversation, which will be long, will no doubt contain tedious chapters, and I fear that Madame will be bored.

"You are wrong to be afraid, sir," Eliane went on, snobbishly;

"I don't know yet, madam, but we will decide soon, and in front of you, since you want it and Monsieur seems to consent to it."

The captain listened with a dazed air, without really understanding. The young count turned towards him as if to take him to task.

“Monsieur,” he said to him, “I am the eldest son of the Marquis de Kerpry, who is known to the whole Faubourg Saint-Germain, and who has his house in the Rue Saint-Dominique.

"What happiness!" exclaimed Eliane bewilderedly.

The Count replied to this exclamation with a cold and ceremonious bow. He continued:

“Sir, as my father, my grandfather and my great-grandfather were only children, and as there have never been two branches in the family, you will excuse the astonishment which seized us the day when we learned by the newspapers the marriage of a Marquess of Kerpry.

"So I didn't have the right to marry?" asked the captain, rubbing his eyes.

“I am not saying that, sir. We have at home, besides the family tree, all the papers that establish our rights to bear the Kerpry name. If you are our relative, as I wish, I have no doubt that you will also have some family papers in your hands.

-What's the point? the paperwork doesn't prove anything, and everyone knows who I am.

“You are right, sir, it does not take many parchments to establish a solid proof; All you need is a birth certificate, with...

“Sir, my birth certificate bears the name of Benoît. It is dated 1794. Do you understand?

"Perfectly, sir, and in spite of this circumstance I still hope to be your kinsman." Were you born in or near Kerpry?

"Kerpry?... Kerpry?" where do you pick up Kerpry?[27]

—But where he has always been: three leagues from Dijon, on the road to Paris.

—Hey! sir, what do I care?[28] since Robespierre sold the family property...

“You have been misinformed, sir. It is true that the land and the castle were put up for sale as emigrants' property,[29] but they did not find a buyer, and SM[30] King Louis XVIII deigned to return them to my father.”

The captain had imperceptibly awakened from his torpor; this last stroke completed his awakening. He walked with clenched fists towards his frail adversary, and shouted in his face:

“My little sir, I have been Marquess of Kerpry for forty years, and whoever tears my name from me will have a strong wrist.”

The Count turned pale with anger, but he remembered the presence of Eliane, who was stretched out, exhausted, on a chaise-longue. He answered in a relaxed tone:

"My great sir, although the judgments of God[31] have gone out of fashion, I would willingly accept the means of conciliation that you offer me, if I were the only one interested in the affair. But here I am representing my father, my brothers and a whole family, who would have reason to complain if I tossed their interests to a coin. So allow me to return to Paris. The courts will decide which of us usurps the name of the other."

Thereupon the count made a pirouette, bowed low to the pretended marquise, and regained his post-chaise before the captain thought of detaining him.

The samovar was no longer boiling; but it wasn't about tea[32] between the captain and his wife. Eliane wanted to know whether or not she was Marquise de Kerpry. The impetuous Benoît, who had just used up his remaining patience, forgot himself to the point of beating the prettiest person in the department. It is to these circumstances that Ms. Benoît was referring when she spoke of a few unpleasant hours long forgotten.

The Kerpry v. Kerpry lawsuit was not long in coming.[33] Although Mr. Benoît repeated through his lawyer that he had always heard himself called Marquis de Kerpry, he was ordered to sign Benoît and pay the costs. The day he received this news, he wrote the young count a letter of gross insults, signed Benoît. The following Sunday, around eight o'clock in the morning, he returned home on a stretcher, with ten centimeters of iron in his body. He had fought, and the Count's sword had broken in the wound. Eliane, who was still asleep, arrived just in time to receive her apologies and her farewells.If this adventure had not caused a terrible scandal, the province would not be the province. The squires in the neighborhood expressed a comic exasperation: they would have liked to take back from the false Marquise the visits they had paid her. The widow did not hear the noise around her: she was crying. It wasn't that she regretted anything about M. Benoît, whose faults, big and small, had forever corrected her from the marriage; but she deplored his deceived confidence, his lost hopes, his narrowed horizon, his ambition condemned to impotence. If you want to picture the state of his soul, imagine a fakir who is told that he will never see Wichnou.[34] From the depths of her retreat, she gazed at the Faubourg Saint-Germain with the gaze of Eve driven out of the earthly paradise.

One morning when she was weeping under a cradle of flowering clematis (it was the summer of 1834), her daughter ran past her. She stopped the child by her dress and kissed her five or six times, reproaching herself for thinking less of her daughter than of her sorrows. When she had kissed her well, she looked her in the face and was satisfied with the examination. At four and a half years old, little Lucile announced a delicate and aristocratic beauty. Her features were charming; the bindings of the feet and hands, exquisite. Eliane searched her memory in vain, but she did not remember having seen a single child of such a distinguished type playing at the Tuileries. She gave a last kiss to the little one, who took her flight. Then she wiped her eyes, and she hasn't cried since.

“But where was my head?[35] she murmured, resuming her happiest smile. All is not lost; everything can be arranged; everything is arranged; it's good; it's for the best! I will enter; it is a matter of patience; it takes time, but those proud doors will open before me. I won't be a Marquise, no; I have been married enough, and no one will reproach me for it again.[36] The marquise, here she is trampling on the strawberries. I'll choose a marquis for him, a good one: my experience has to be of some use. I will be the real mother of a real marquise! She will be received everywhere, and so will I; celebrated everywhere, and so am I; she will dance with dukes, and I... I will watch her dance, unless these gentlemen of 1830[37] make it a law to leave moms in the locker room!”

From that moment, his sole concern was to prepare his daughter for the role of marquise. She dressed him like a doll, taught him the various grimaces of which great manners are composed, and taught him reverence, while his governess taught him the alphabet. Unfortunately, little Lucile was not born in the rue du Bac. She awoke to the chirping of birds and not to the rolling of carriages, and she saw more villagers in blouses than lackeys in livery. She listened no better to the lessons in aristocracy given her by her mother than her mother had listened to M. Lopinot's diatribes against the marquises. Children's minds are shaped by everything around them; their ears are open to a hundred tutors at once; the noises of the countryside and the noises of the street speak to them much louder than the most intractable pedant or the most rigorous father. Madame Benoît preached in vain: the first pleasures of the young marquise were to fight with the little girls of the village, to roll in the sand in a new dress, to steal hot eggs from the[38] the chicken coop, and being dragged by a large Scottish dog which she pulled by the tail. Seeing her playing in the garden, an attentive observer would have guessed the blood of Bonhomme Morel and Father Lopinot.[39] . Her mother lamented that she found neither pride nor vanity nor the simplest gesture of coquetry in her. She waited with feverish impatience for the day when Lucile would despise someone, but Lucile opened her heart and her arms to all the good people around her, from Margot the cowherd to the blackest of the forge workers. When she grew up[40] , his tastes changed a little, but it was not in the direction that his mother wanted. She was interested in the garden, the orchard, the herd, the barnyard, the factory, the household, and even (why wouldn't we say so?) in the kitchen. She had an eye for fruit, she studied the art of making jam, she worried about pastry. Strange thing! the people of the house, instead of growing impatient with his surveillance, were very grateful to him for it.[41] . They understood, better than Madame Benoît, how beautiful it is for a woman to learn order, care, a wise and liberal economy, and those obscure talents which make the charm of a house and the joy of guests. to which she opens her door.
