Towards the middle of the rue de l'Universite, between numbers 51 and 57, one sees four hotels which can be counted among the most beautiful in Paris. The first belongs to Mr. Pozzo di Borgo; the second, to the Comte de Mailly; the third, to the Duc de Choiseul; the last to the Baron de Sanglie. It's the one at the corner of rue Bellechasse.

The Hôtel de Sanglie is a dwelling of noble appearance. The porte-cochere opens onto a main courtyard carefully sanded and lined with centuries-old trellises. The porter's lodge is on the left, hidden under thick ivy where sparrows and porters babble in unison. At the far end of the courtyard on the right, a wide flight of steps, sheltered under an awning, leads to the vestibule and the grand staircase. The ground floor and the first are occupied by the baron alone; he enjoys without sharing a vast garden bounded by other gardens, populated by warblers, blackbirds and squirrels which go from one house to another in complete freedom, as if they were inhabitants of a wood , and not citizens of Paris.

The arms of the Sanglie, painted in wax, are repeated on all the walls of the vestibule. It is a boar Or on a field Gules. The escutcheon is supported by two greyhounds and surmounted by a baron's tortil with this legend: SANG LIÉ AU ROY. Half a dozen live greyhounds, grouped according to their whim, are irritated at the foot of the stairs, nibbling at the veronicas in flower in the vases of Japan, or flattening themselves on the carpet, stretching out their serpentine heads. The footmen, seated on benches in Beauvais, solemnly cross their arms, as befits people of good house.

On January 1, 1853, around nine o'clock in the morning, all the servants of the hotel held a tumultuous congress in the vestibule. The baron's steward, M. Anatole, had just distributed their gifts to them. The butler had received five hundred francs, the valet two hundred and fifty. The least favored of all, the scullion, gazed with inexpressible tenderness at two beautiful, brand new louis d'or. There were jealous people in the assembly, but not a discontented one, and each said in his own language that it is a pleasure to serve a rich and generous master.

These gentlemen formed a rather picturesque group around one of the vents of the radiator. The early ones already had the full livery; the others still wore the waistcoat with sleeves, which is the undress of servants. The valet de chambre was dressed all in black, with list slippers; the gardener looked like a villager in his Sunday best; the coachman was in a knit jacket and braided hat; the Swiss, in golden baldric and sabots. You could see here and there, along the walls, a whip, a currycomb, a waxing stick, a wolf's head, and feather dusters, the number of which I do not know.

The master slept until noon, like a man who had spent the night at the club: there was plenty of time to get to work. Everyone made use of his money in advance, and the castles in Spain were going well. All the men, young and old, are from Perrette's family who carried a milk jug.

"With that and what I have on hand," said the butler, "I'll supplement my life annuity." We have our work cut out, thank God! and one will not allow oneself to be wanting for anything in one's old age.

—Parbleu! resumed the valet, you are a bachelor; you only have to think about yourself. But I have family. Also, I will give my money to this little young man who goes to the Stock Exchange. He'll touch me something.

"That's an idea, Monsieur Ferdinand," replied the scullion.
Take my forty francs to him when you go.”
The valet replied in a protective tone: “Is he young!
What can one do at the Stock Exchange with forty francs?
"Come on," said the young man, stifling a sigh, "I'll put them in the savings bank!"

The coachman burst out laughing. He beat on his stomach, shouting: “My savings bank, to me, here it is. That's where I've always put my money, and I've been fine with it. Isn't it, Father Altroff?"

Father Altroff, Swiss by profession, Alsatian by birth, tall, vigorous, bony, paunchy, broad-shouldered, huge-headed, and as ruddy as a young hippopotamus, smiled out of the corner of his eye and waved with his tongue. a little noise that was worth a long poem.

The gardener, fine flower of Norman, rang his money in his hand, and replied to the honorable nodding: “Allais, marcheais! what we drank, we no longer have. There is no such placement as a good hiding place in an old wall or in a hollow tree. Money well buried, the notaries do not eat it!”

The assembly protested at the naïveté of the worthy man who buried his crowns alive, instead of putting them to work. Fifteen or sixteen exclamations rose at the same time. Everyone said their word, betrayed their secret, straddled their hobbies, shook their hobbies. Each knocked on his pocket and noisily caressed the certain hopes, the clear and liquid happiness that he had spent in the morning. Gold mingled its shrill little voice with this concert of vulgar passions; and the clink of twenty-franc pieces, more heady than the smoke of wine or the smell of gunpowder, intoxicated those poor brains and quickened the beating of those coarse hearts.

At the height of the tumult, a small door opened on the staircase, between the ground floor and the first floor. A woman, dressed in black rags, hurried down the steps, crossed the vestibule, opened the glass door and disappeared into the yard.

It was a matter of a minute, and yet this gloomy apparition extinguished the joy of all these servants in good humor. They rose as he passed with marks of profound respect. The cries stopped in their throats, and the gold no longer rang in their pockets. The poor woman had left behind her a trail of silence and amazement.

The first to recover was the valet, a strong spirit.

“Sapristi! he cried, I thought I saw poverty in person. This is my spoiled New Year's Day in the morning. You will see that nothing will work for me until New Year's Eve. Brrr! I have cold in the back.

-Poor woman! said the butler. It had thousands and hundreds, and then here it is! Who would believe she's a duchess?

"It's her beggar husband who ate her everything."

-A player!

"A man on his mouth!"

—A runner who trots from morning till night, with his old legs, following all the party favors!

“I'm not interested in him: he only gets what he deserves.

"Do we know how Mlle. Germaine is?"

“Their nigger told me she was at rock bottom. She spits out blood with a handkerchief.

"And no carpet in his room!" That child would only recover in hot countries, in Florence or in Italy.

"That will make an angel in God's heaven."

"It's those who remain who are to be pitied!"

“I don't know how the Duchess will get out of this. Endless accounts with all suppliers! The baker talks about refusing them credit.

"How much rent do they have up there?"

—Eight hundred. But I wonder if sir has ever seen the color of their money.

“If I were his, I'd rather leave the little apartment vacant than keep people who are a stain in the hotel.

"Are you stupid!" To pick up the Duc de La Tour d'Embleuse and his family from the pavement? These miseries, you see, are like the wounds of the faubourg: we all have an interest in hiding them.

-Take! said the scullion, I really don't care! Why don't they work? The dukes are men like the others.

-Boy! resumed the butler gravely, you are saying incoherent things. The proof that they are not men like the others is that I, your superior, will not only be a baron for an hour of my life. Besides, the Duchess is a sublime woman, and she does things that neither you nor I would be capable of. Would you eat porridge for a year at all your meals?

-Lady! it is not amusing, boiled!

-Well! the duchess puts on the pot-au-feu every other day, because her husband doesn't like lean soup. Monsieur dines on a good tapioca au gras, with a steak or a pair of cutlets, and the poor holy woman swallows every last piece of meat boiling in the house. Is that beautiful?”

The scullion was touched in the soul. “My good Monsieur Tournoy,” he said to the butler, “these are very interesting people. Couldn't we pass them some sweets, by getting along with their negress?

—Oh yes! she is as proud as they are; she wouldn't want anything from us. And yet, in my opinion, she does not breakfast every day."

This conversation might have lasted a long time if M. Anatole had not come to interrupt it. He entered just in time to cut off the hunter, who opened his mouth for the first time. The assembly dispersed in haste; each orator took away his instruments of work, and only one of those gigantic brooms which are called wolf's heads remained in the deliberation room.

Meanwhile Marguerite de Bisson, Duchess of La Tour d'Embleuse, was hurrying along in the direction of the rue Jacob. Passersby who brushed past her as they ran to give or receive gifts found her like those desperate Irish women who trample on the tarmac of the streets of London in pursuit of a penny. Daughter of the Dukes of Brittany, wife of a former governor of Senegal, the Duchess wore a straw hat dyed black, the straps of which twisted like strings. An imitation veil, pierced in five or six places, badly concealed her face and gave her a strange physiognomy. This beautiful head, marked with white spots of unequal size, seemed disfigured by smallpox. An old crepe de chine, blackened by the care of the dyer and scorched by the inclemency of the air, sadly dropped its three points, the fringe of which brushed the snow on the sidewalk. The dress that hid under there was so tired that the fabric was unrecognizable. You would have had to examine it very closely and with a magnifying glass to recognize an old moire, demolished, filed down, cut in the folds, frayed at the bottom, and devoured by the corrosive mud of the pavement of Paris. The shoes that supported this lamentable edifice no longer had either shape or color. The linen showed nowhere, neither on the collar nor on the sleeves. Sometimes, at the passage of a stream, the dress was raised on the right and revealed a gray woolen stocking, a simple petticoat of black fustian. The hands of the duchess, reddened by a biting cold, were hidden under her shawl.

By a contrast which you have sometimes observed, the Duchess was neither thin, nor pale, nor in any way ugly with poverty. She had received from her ancestors one of those rebellious beauties who resist everything, even hunger. We have seen prisoners fattening in their dungeon until the hour of death. At the age of forty-seven, Madame de La Tour d'Embleuse retained the fine remnants of her youth. Her hair was black, and she had thirty-two teeth capable of crushing the hardest bread. Her health was less flourishing than her face, but that was a secret between her and her doctor. The Duchess was approaching that dangerous and sometimes fatal hour when the woman disappears to make room for the grandmother. More than once she had been seized by strange suffocations. She often dreamed that the blood was choking her throat. Inexplicable heat rose to her brain in puffs, and she awoke in a bath of animal steam where she was surprised not to die. Doctor Le Bris, a young doctor and an old friend, recommended a gentle diet, without fatigue and above all without emotions. But what Stoic soul would have gone through such harsh trials without being moved?

The Duke Cesar de La Tour d'Embleuse, son of one of the emigrants most loyal to the king and most bitter against the country, was magnificently rewarded for the services of his father. In 1827 Charles X appointed him Governor General of our possessions in West Africa. He was barely forty years old. During twenty-eight months of stay in the colony, he stood up to the Moors and yellow fever; then he asked for leave to come and get married in Paris. He was rich, thanks to the billion indemnity; he doubled his fortune by marrying the beautiful Marguerite de Bisson, who had an income of sixty thousand francs at Saint-Brieuc. The king signed his contract the same day as the ordinances, and the duke found himself married and suddenly deposed. The new power would have gladly welcomed him into the crowd of defectors; it is even said that the ministry of Casimir Périer made some advances to him. He disdained all jobs, out of pride at first, and as much out of invincible laziness. Whether he had spent all his energy in three years, or whether the easy life of Paris retained him by an irresistible attraction, his only work for ten years was to walk his horses in the Bois and show his yellow gloves in the foyer of the Opera. Paris was a new country for him, for he had lived in the countryside under the inflexible rule of his father, until the day he left for Senegal. He tasted all the pleasures so late that he had no time to get bored. he would have spent in three years all his energy, whether the easy life of Paris retained him by an irresistible attraction, his only work during ten years was to walk his horses in the Bois and to show his yellow gloves to the foyer of the Opera.

He tasted all the pleasures so late that he had no time to get bored.

Everything seemed good to him, the pleasures of the table, the satisfactions of vanity, the emotions of gambling, and even the austere joys of the family. He showed in his house the eagerness of a young husband, and in society the ardor of an emancipated son of a family. His wife was the happiest in France, but she was not the only one he made happy. He wept with joy at the birth of his daughter, around the summer of 1835. In the excess of his happiness, he bought a country house from a dancer he was mad about. The dinners he gave at his house had no rivals, except the suppers he gave at his mistress's. The world, which is always indulgent towards men, forgave him this waste of his life and his fortune. It was found that he did things gallantly, since his pleasures outside did not arouse a painful echo in his house. In fairness, could he be reproached for spilling everywhere the overflow of his purse and his heart? No woman pitied the Duchess; and, indeed, she was not to be pitied. He carefully avoided compromising himself, he only appeared in public with his wife, and he would rather have missed a game than send her to the ball alone.

This partly double life, and the consideration with which a gallant man knows how to envelope his pleasures, soon dented his capital. Nothing costs more in Paris than shadow and discretion. The duke was too great a lord to reckon with anyone. He never knew how to refuse anything to his wife or to the wife of others. Do not think that he was unaware of the enormous breaches he made in his fortune; but he counted on the game to fix everything. Men to whom good has come while sleeping get used to unlimited trust in fate. M. de La Tour d'Embleuse was happy as one who takes the cards for the first time. It is estimated that his earnings for the year 1841 doubled his income and more. But nothing lasts in this world, not even happiness at play: he soon experienced that. The liquidation of 1848, who laid bare so many miseries, informed him that he was ruined without resource. He saw under his feet a bottomless abyss. Another would have lost his mind; he did not even lose hope. He went straight to his wife and said to her cheerfully: “My dear Marguerite, this accursed revolution has taken everything from us. We don't have a thousand francs to ourselves."

The Duchess did not expect such news. She thought of her daughter, and wept bitterly.

"Don't be afraid," he told her; it's a passing storm. Count on me; I rely on chance. They say that I am a light man; so much the better! I'll be back on the water."

The poor woman wiped her tears and said to him:

"Good my friend! You work?-Me! So fi! I will wait for Fortune: she is capricious; she is too well with me to leave me point-blank without a thought of returning.”

The duke waited eight years in a small apartment in the Hôtel de Sanglie, above the stables. His old friends, as soon as they had time to recognize each other, helped him with their scholarship and their credit. He borrowed without scruple, like a man who had lent a lot without a note. He was offered several jobs, all honorable ones. An industrial company wanted to add him to its supervisory board, with an allowance that was worth a salary. He refused, for fear of deviating. "I want to sell my time well," he said; but I do not intend to lend my name.” This is how he descended one by one all the rungs of misery, discouraging his friends, tiring his creditors, closing all the doors, using his name which he did not want to compromise, but without ever taking it seriously. 'thin coat that'

On January 1, 1853, the Duchess wore her wedding ring to the pawnshop.

One must be deprived of all human help to pledge an object of so little value as a wedding ring. But the Duchess didn't have a penny at home, and one doesn't live without money, although trust is the mainspring of Parisian commerce. One procures many things without paying for them, when one can throw a fine name and an imposing address on the merchant's counter. You can furnish your house, fill your cellar and assemble your wardrobe without showing the suppliers the color of your crowns. But there are a thousand daily expenses which are only made by purse. A suit is taken on credit, but the mending is paid for in cash. It is sometimes easier to buy a watch than to buy a cabbage. The Duchess had a balance of credit with some suppliers, which she arranged with religious care; but as for the money, she did not know where to get it. The Duc de La Tour d'Embleuse no longer had any friends: he had spent them like the rest of his fortune. Such a college friend loves us to the extent of a thousand francs; such a companion of pleasure is a man to lend us a hundred louis; such a charitable neighbor represents a value of a thousand crowns. Beyond a certain figure, the lender is released from all the duties of friendship: he has nothing to reproach himself for; he did things right; he no longer owes you anything; he has the right to look away when he meets you and to defend his door when you enter his house. The duchess's friends had broken away from her one after another. The friendship of women is assuredly more chivalrous than that of men; but in both sexes one has lasting affection only for one's equals. One experiences a delicate pleasure in climbing a difficult staircase two or three times and sitting down in full dress beside a pallet, but there are few souls heroic enough to live familiarly with the misfortunes of others. The dearest friends of the poor woman, those who called her Marguerite, had felt their hearts grow cold in this apartment without a carpet and without a fire; they no longer came there. When they were told about the Duchess, they praised her, they pitied her sincerely, they said: “We still love each other, but we hardly ever see each other. It's her husband's fault!"

In this lamentable neglect, the Duchess had recourse to the last friend of the unfortunate, to the creditor who lends at high interest, but without objection and without reproach. The pawnbroker kept his jewelry, his furs, his lace, the best of his linen and his wardrobe, and the penultimate mattress of his bed. She had started everything under the eyes of the old duke, who was watching all the pieces of his furniture leave one by one, and cheerfully wished them a good trip. This incomprehensible old man lived in his house like Louis XV in his kingdom, without concern for the future, and saying: “After me the deluge!” He rose late, breakfasted with a good appetite, spent an hour at his toilet, dyed his hair, plastered his wrinkles, put on rouge, polished his nails, and walked his graces through Paris to the dinner time. He was not surprised to see a good meal on the table, and he was too discreet to ask his wife where she had found it. If the pittance was meager, he made his mourning for it, and smiled at bad fortune as formerly at good. When Germaine started coughing, he pleasantly joked about this bad habit. He was a long time without seeing that she was wasting away. The day he noticed it, he felt a great annoyance. He was a long time without seeing that she was wasting away. The day he noticed it, he felt a great annoyance. He was a long time without seeing that she was wasting away. The day he noticed it, he felt a great annoyance.

When the doctor told her that the poor child could only be saved by a miracle. He called him Doctor Tant-Pis, and said, rubbing his hands: "Come, come, it will be nothing!" He wasn't sure himself whether he was putting on these casual airs to reassure his family, or whether his natural levity prevented him from feeling the pain. His wife and daughter adored him as he was. He treated the Duchess with the same gallantry as the day after the wedding, and he made Germaine jump on his knees. The Duchess never suspected him of being the cause of her ruin; she saw in him, for twenty-three years, a perfect man; she took his indifference for courage and firmness; she hoped in him, in spite of everything, and believed him capable of restoring her house by a stroke of fortune.
