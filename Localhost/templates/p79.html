One day, when he was about seven years old, he was sitting upon the steps of the door, and he heard a noise in the street, as of some sort of carriage approaching. A moment afterwards, a carryall came in sight. It drove up to the front gate, and stopped. he’s father and mother and his little brother Nathan got out. His father fastened the horse to the post, and came in.

When he first heard the noise of the carryall, he was sitting still upon the steps of the door, thinking. He was thinking of something that Jonas, his father’s hired boy, had told him about the sun’s shining in at the barn door. There was a very large double door to he’s father’s barn, and as this door opened towards the south, the sun [Pg 12]used to shine in very warm, upon the barn floor, in the middle of the day.

he and Jonas had been sitting there husking some corn,—for it was in the fall of the year;—and as it was rather a cool autumnal day, he said it was lucky that the sun shone in, for it kept them warm.

“Yes,” said Jonas; “and what is remarkable, it always shines in farther in the winter than it does in the summer.”

“Does it?” said he.

“Yes,” said Jonas.

“And what is the reason?” asked he.

“I don’t know,” said Jonas, “unless it is because we want it in the barn more in the winter than we do in the summer.”

“Ho!” said he; “I don’t believe that is the reason.”

“Why not?” said Jonas.

“O, I don’t believe the sun moves about in the heavens, to different places, only just to shine into barn doors.”

“Why, it keeps a great many farmers’ boys more comfortable,” said Jonas.

“Is it so in all barns?” asked he.

“I suppose so,” said Jonas.

After some further conversation on the [Pg 13]subject, the boys determined to watch the reflection of the sun’s beams upon the barn floor for a good many days, and to mark the place that it came in to, at noon every day, with a piece of chalk. It was only a few minutes before the carryall came up, that they had determined upon this, and had marked the place for that day; and then he had come out of the barn, and was sitting upon the door step, thinking of the subject, when his reflections were interrupted in the manner already described.

So, when he saw his father getting out of the carryall, he ran to meet him, and called out to him, talking very loud and rapidly,

“Father, Jonas says that the sun shines farther in, upon the barn floor, in winter than in summer;—does it, do you think?”

But this was not a proper time for he to bring up his philosophical question. His father had a carpet bag and several packages in his hands, and he was also conducting he’s mother in, and thinking about the horse and carryall. So he told he that he must not speak to him then, for he could not attend to him.

[Pg 14]

he then walked along back into the yard, and began to think of the subject of the sun’s shining in at the south door. He looked up towards the sun, and began to consider what sort of a change in its place, at noon, on different days, would be necessary in order to account for its shining in more at south doors and windows, on some days, than on others. He reflected that if the sun were exactly overhead, at noon, it could not shine in at any doors at all; for the rays would then strike perpendicularly down the sides of the houses. While he was standing thus, lost in thought, looking up to the sun, with his arm across his forehead, to shelter his eyes a little from the dazzling rays, he suddenly felt the pressure of two soft hands upon his ears, as of somebody who had come up behind him. He turned round, and found his cousin Lucy standing there.

Lucy asked him what he was thinking of, and he told her. He then took Lucy into the barn, and showed her the chalk mark upon the floor. She looked on with a good deal of interest, and said she thought it was an excellent plan; and she wished there was a [Pg 15]great barn with a south floor at their house. Lucy knew more about the subject than he did, and she gave him some explanations about it. “You see,” said she, “that the sun rises in the east every morning, and comes up higher and higher, every hour, till noon; and then it begins to go down again, and at last it sets in the west. But, at some times in the year, it comes up higher at noon than it does at other times, and so it does not shine so much into the door.”

“It shines more, you mean,” said he.

“No,” said Lucy; “not so much. In the winter the sun moves around by the south, and keeps pretty low all day, and of course shines farther into doors and windows.”

Then, after a moment’s pause, she added,

“If we should mark the place on the floor all the year round, we should find what time the sun is farthest to the south.”

“So we should,” said he.

“It would be in the winter,” said Lucy.

“Yes,” said he; “in the middle of the winter exactly.”

“Yes,” said Lucy; “and in the middle of the summer it would be nearest overhead.”

[Pg 16]

“Jonas and I will try it,” said he.

“I can try it in the house,” said Lucy, “where the sun shines in at my chamber window.”

“O no,” said he; “that won’t do.”

“Why not?” said Lucy.

“Because the window does not come down to the floor, and so does not let the sun in enough.”

“O, that makes no difference,” said Lucy; “we have nothing to do with the bottom of the door; you only mark where it shines in the farthest, and that place is made by the top of the door, for it shines in farthest by the top of the door.”

“Well,” said he, “I don’t know but that the house will do; but then you can’t chalk on the carpet.”

“Chalk on the carpet?” said Lucy.

“Yes, to mark the place.”

“No,” said Lucy, thinking; “but I can mark it some other way.”

“How?” asked he.

“Why, I can put a pin in,” said Lucy.

“O dear,” said he, with a laugh, “put a pin in! That’s no way to mark a shadow.”

[Pg 17]

“It isn’t a shadow,” said Lucy.

“Yes, it is,” said he.

“No,” said Lucy; “a shadow is dark, and this is bright.”

“Yes,” said he, “this is a bright shadow; some shadows are bright, and some are dark.”

“O he!” said Lucy; and she turned away from him, a little out of humor.

The truth was, that he and Lucy were getting decidedly into a dispute. From the sublime heights of practical astronomy, they had fallen, by a sad and very rapid descent, to a childish altercation. he had a very high idea of the superior facilities afforded by Jonas’s barn floor for observing the daily changes in the sun’s meridian altitude, and he did not like the idea of Lucy’s finding that she had equally good opportunities for observation at her home. Lucy was a little fretted at he’s captious spirit; but then her mind soon became unruffled again, and she turned back towards he, and said, as they walked along the yard,

“I don’t think the sunshine on the floor is a shadow, he; but then I don’t see why a shadow would not do, just as well.”

[Pg 18]

“How?” said he.

“Why, look there at the shadow of that post,—that would do.”

She pointed to a post with a rounded top upon it, which stood by the side of the garden gate. The shadow, clear, distinct, and well defined, was projected upon the walk; and Lucy told he that they might mark the place where the top of that shadow came every day, and that that would do just as well.

“But how could we mark it?” said he.

“Why, we could drive a little stake unto the ground.”

“O, that would not do,” said he. “People would trip over them, and break them down. They would be exactly in the walk.”

Lucy saw that this would be a difficulty, and, for a moment, seemed to be at a loss. At length, she said,

“We might go somewhere else, then, where the people would not come.”

“But what should we do for a post?” said he.

[Pg 19]

“Could not we get Jonas to drive a tall stake down?” said Lucy.

“Yes,” said he; “I suppose so.”

The children went out into the garden to find a good smooth place, and while they were walking about there, he’s mother came out, and they told her the whole story. She seemed quite interested in the plan, and told them of a better way than any that they had thought of.

“You see,” said she, “that the height of the stake or pole that makes the shadow is not material; for the shadow of a small one will vary just as much, in proportion to its length, as that of a long one will. So, instead of taking a wooden stake, out of doors, you might take a large pin, and drive it down a little way into the window sill, in the house. Then you can mark the shadow with a pen, very exactly.”

“So we can,” said Lucy, clapping her hands.

“And you might put a piece of white paper, or a card down first,” continued he’s mother, “and drive the pin through that, and then mark the places where the end of the shadow comes every day, directly [Pg 20]on the card, with a fine pen. Thus you could be a great deal more exact than you can in chalking upon a barn floor.”

he asked his mother if she would not be kind enough to help them fix their apparatus; but she said she would give them particular directions, though she should prefer letting them do the whole themselves, and then, if they met with any difficulties, they might come and report them to her, and she would tell them how to surmount them. So she recommended to them to go and find a blank card, or piece of white pasteboard, or of stiff white paper, as big as a common card. “Then,” said she, “choose some window where the sun shines in at noon, and put the card down upon the sill, and drive the pin down through it. But you must not drive the pin through the middle of the card, for the shadow will always be off to the north of the pin, and therefore the pin may be pretty near the south end of the card. Then the shadow will be more likely to come wholly upon the card, even when it is longest. You had better place the card in such a position, too, that its sides shall lie in the direction of [Pg 21]north and south. Then the shadow at noon will lie along exactly in the middle of it. You must get a large and stout pin, too; and drive it in firmly, a little way, with a small hammer. It will be well, too, to drive another smaller pin into the other end of the card, so as to keep it fixed in its north and south position.”

“How can we know when it is north and south, exactly?” said Lucy.

“You cannot do it exactly,” said he’s mother; “but you can get it pretty near. One way is to borrow father’s little compass, and adjust it by that. Another way is to see when it is exactly twelve o’clock by the clock, and then the shadow of the pin will of itself be about north.

“Then you might move the north end of the card until the shadow is brought exactly into the middle of the card, and then put the other pin in, and fix it in that place. Then if you make a mark along where the shadow comes, that mark will be a north and south line, and you can mark the place where the shadow of the pin’s head crosses that line, when it crosses it every day at noon.”

[Pg 22]

The children said that they believed they understood the directions, and they determined to try the plan. They thought they would fix two cards, one at he’s house, and one at Lucy’s; and they immediately went off in pursuit of blank cards and big pins.

PRUNING.
One afternoon, he saw his father coming out into the garden, with a little saw and a knife, and a small pot of paint in his hands.

“Father,” said he, “are you going to prune your trees now?”

“Yes,” said his father.

“Then, shall I go and get my wheelbarrow?”

“Yes,” replied his father, again.

So he ran off after his wheelbarrow. It had been arranged, between him and his father that morning, that they should work in the garden an hour or two in the afternoon, and that he should pick up all the cuttings from the trees, and wheel them away, and then, when they were dry, make a bonfire with them.

he found his wheelbarrow in its proper place, and trundled it along into the garden.

“Father,” said he, “what trees are you going to prune first?”

[Pg 24]

“O, I am going to begin at the back side of the garden, and prune them all, advancing regularly to the front.”

“What is the saw for?” said he.

“To saw off the large branches, that I can’t cut off easily with a knife.”

“But I should not think you would want to saw off any large branches, for so you will lose all the apples that would grow on them next year.”

“Why, sometimes, the branches are dead, and then they would do no good, but only be in the way.”

“But do they do any hurt?” said he.

“Why, they look badly.”

“But, I mean, would they do any actual hurt to the tree?”

“Why, I don’t know,” said his father; “perhaps they would not. At any rate, if I cut them off pretty close to the living part of the tree, the bark will then gradually extend out over the little stump that I leave, and finally cover it over, and take it all in, as it were.”

By this time, he and his father had reached the back side of the garden, and his father showed him the place where he [Pg 25]had cut off a limb the year before, and he saw how the fresh young bark had protruded itself all around it, and was spreading in towards the centre so as to cover it over. he then saw that it was better that all old dead limbs should be cut off.

“That’s curious,” said he.

“Yes, very curious,” said his father. “A tree will take in, and cover up, almost any thing that is fastened to the wood, in the same manner.”

“Will it?” said he.

“Yes,” said his father. “If you drive a nail into a tree, the bark will, after a time, cover it over entirely. Sometimes people find things in old trees, which were put upon them when they were young.”

“How big things?” said he.

“O, I don’t know exactly how big. The tree will make an effort to enclose any thing small or large. Only, if it is very large, it will take a great while to enclose it, and it might be so large that it never could enclose it.”

“Well, father, how large must it be so that the tree never could enclose it?”

“O, I don’t know, exactly. Once I saw [Pg 26]a tree that was growing very near a rock. After a time it came in contact with it, and it grew and pressed against it, until the rock crowded into the wood. Then the bark began to protrude in every direction along the rock, as if it was making an effort to spread out and take the rock all in. But I don’t think it will ever succeed; for the rock was part of a ledge in a pretty large hill.”

“What a silly tree!” said he.

“Father, I believe I will try the experiment some time,” continued he, after a pause.

“Very well,” said his father.

“What shall I put into the tree?” asked he.

“You might put in a cent,” said his father, “and then, if it should get fairly enclosed, I presume the tree will keep it safe for you a good many years.”

he determined to do it. “Then,” said he, “I shall never be out of money, and that will be excellent.” His father told him that he must make a small cleft in the bark and wood, with a chisel and mallet, and then drive the cent in, edgewise, a little way.

[Pg 27]

So he got his chisel and mallet, and inserted the cent according to his father’s directions, and by that time there were a good many branches and twigs on the ground, which his father had taken off from the trees, and so he began to pick them up, and put them into his wheelbarrow.

They went on working together for some time, and talking while they worked. he was continually asking his father questions, and his father sometimes answered them, and sometimes did not, but was silent and thoughtful, as if he was thinking of something else. But whether he got answers or not, he went on talking.


“Father,” said he, at length, after a short pause, during which he had been busily at work putting twigs into his wheelbarrow, “Henry has got a very interesting book.”

His father did not answer.

“I think it is a very interesting book indeed. Should not you like to read it, father?”

His father was just then reaching up very high to saw off a pretty large limb, and he paid no attention to what he was [Pg 28]
[Pg 29]
[Pg 30]saying. So he went on talking half to himself—

“One story is about Aladdin and his lamp. If he rubbed his lamp, he could have whatever he wished; something would come, I have forgotten what its name was, and bring him whatever he asked for.”

Just then, down came the great branch which his father had been sawing off, falling from its place on the tree to the ground.

he looked at it a moment, and then, when his father began sawing again, he said,

“Should not you like such a lamp, father?”

“Such a lamp as what, my son?” said his father.

“Why, such a one as Aladdin’s.”

“Aladdin’s! why, what do you know of Aladdin’s lamp?”

“Why, I read about it in Henry’s story book,” said he. “I just told you, father.”

“Did you?” said his father. “Won’t you just hand me up the paint brush?”

“Well, father,” said he, as he handed [Pg 31]him the brush, “don’t you wish you had an Aladdin’s lamp?”

“No, not particularly,” said his father.

“O father!” exclaimed he, with surprise, “I am sure I do. Don’t you wish I had such a lamp, father?”

“No,” said his father.

“Why, father, I really think I could do some good with it. For instance, I could just rub my lamp, and then have all your trees pruned for you, at once, without any further trouble.”

“But that would not be worth while; for you might have a much larger and better garden than this made at once, with thousands of trees, bearing delicious fruit; and ponds, and waterfalls, and beautiful groves.”

“O, so I could,” said he.

“And, then, how soon do you think you should get tired of it, and want another?”

“O, perhaps, I should want another pretty soon; but then I could have another, you know.”

“Yes, and how long do you think you could find happiness, in calling beautiful gardens into existence, one after another?”

[Pg 32]

“O, I don’t know;—a good while.”

“A day?”

“O, yes, father.”

“A week?”

“Why, perhaps, I should be tired in a week.”“Then all your power of receiving enjoyment from gardens would be run out and exhausted in a week; whereas mine, without any Aladdin’s lamp, lasts me year after year, pleasantly increasing all the time without ever reaching satiety.”

“What is satiety, father?”

“The feeling we experience when we have had so much of a good thing that we are completely tired and sick of it. If I should give a little child as much honey as he could eat, or let him play all the time, or buy him a vast collection of pictures, he would soon get tired of these things.”

“O father, I never should get tired of looking at pictures.”

“I think you would,” said his father.

Here the conversation stopped a few minutes, while he went to wheel away a load of his sticks. Before he returned, he [Pg 33]had prepared himself to renew his argument. He said,

“Father, even if I did get tired of making beautiful gardens, I could then do something else with the lamp, and that would give me new pleasure.”

“Yes, but the new pleasure would be run out and exhausted just as soon as the pleasure of having a garden would have been; so that you would, in a short time, be satiated with every thing, and become completely wretched and miserable.”

“But, father,” said he, after being silent a little while, “I don’t think I should get tired of my beautiful gardens very soon: I don’t think I should get tired even of looking at pictures of them.”

“Should you like to try the experiment?”

“Yes, sir,” said he, very eagerly.

he’s father had a great many books of pictures and engravings of various kinds in his library; and sometimes he used to allow the children to see them, but only a very few at a time. They had not yet seen them all. He only allowed them to see them as fast as they had time to examine [Pg 34]them thoroughly, and read about them and understand them. But now he said to he,

“I could let you have all the books of prints and engravings I have got, and see them all at one time, and that would be giving you Aladdin’s lamp, exactly, so far as my pictures are concerned.”

“Well,” said he, clapping his hands.

“But then, in a short time, you would get tired of looking at them; you would become satiated, and would in fact spoil the whole pleasure by attempting to enjoy it too fast. But then I think it would perhaps do you good.”

“How, father?”

“Why, by teaching you the value of moderation, and the uselessness of Aladdin’s lamps in all human enjoyments. It would be a very valuable experiment in intellectual philosophy, which I think it very probable might be of use to you. So, if you please, you may try it.”

“Well, father, I am sure I should like to see the pictures.”

“That is all settled then,” said his father; “some day you shall.”

THE GREAT BEETLE AND WEDGE.
he was coming home one morning after having been away on an errand, and he saw a large wood pile near Farmer Cropwell’s door. Now it happened that he had once been on a journey pretty far back into the country; it was at the time when Jonas told him and Lucy the stories related in the book called “Jonas’s Stories.” On that journey, Jonas had one day told him that the sap of the maple-tree was sweet, and had let him taste of some, where it oozed out at the end of the log. Seeing Farmer Cropwell’s wood pile reminded he of this; and he thought he would look at the ends of all the logs, and see if he could not find some drops of sweet sap there.

But he could not, for two reasons: none of those trees were maple-trees, and then, besides, they were all dry. There was no sap in them of any kind; at least, not enough to ooze out. While he was looking [Pg 36]there, one of Farmer Cropwell’s large boys came out with an axe in his hand. He rolled out a pretty large log of wood, though it was not very long, and struck his axe into the end of it, as if he was going to split it.

“I don’t believe you can split that great log,” said he.

“I don’t expect to do it with the axe,” said the boy, as he left the axe sticking in the log.

“How then?” said he.

“I have got beetle and wedges here, round behind the wood pile.”

So the boy went to another side of the wood pile, and brought a large beetle and an iron wedge. When he got back to his log, he started out the axe which he had left sticking into it. Then he saw that the axe had made a little indentation, or cleft, in the wood. He put the point of the wedge into this cleft, and drove it in a very little, with a few light blows with the axe. Then he took the great heavy beetle, and began driving the wedge in, with very heavy blows.

Presently, he saw a little crack beginning [Pg 37]to extend out each side from the wedge. The crack ran along across the end of the log, and thence down the side, and grew wider and wider every moment. At last, the wedge was driven in as far as it would go, and still the log was not split open.

“Now stop,” said he; “I will put a stick in, and keep the crack open, while you drive the wedge in, in another place.”

“O, that won’t do,” said the boy; “a stick would not keep it open.”

“Why not?” said he.

“Because it is not solid enough; the sides of the cleft draw together very hard. They would crush the stick.”

Here he put his hand into his pocket, and drew out a walnut, and he asked the boy if it would crack a walnut.

“Try it,” said the boy.

So he put the walnut into the crack. He slipped it along until he got it to a place where the crack was just wide enough to receive it, and hold it steady. He left it there, and then the boy began to knock out the wedge.

He struck it first upon one side, and then upon the other, and thus gradually worked it [Pg 38]out. The walnut was crushed all to pieces. The boy then drove in the wedge again, so as to open the log as it was before. He then went to the place where he had got the beetle and wedge at first, and brought a large wooden wedge which he had made before, and began to put that into the crack, not very far from the iron wedge.

“This will keep it open,” said he.

“Yes, I think it will,” said he. “But put it up close to the iron wedge.”

“No,” said the boy; “for then I can’t knock the iron wedge out.”

So the boy put the large wooden wedge in, at a little distance from the iron one, and drove it in rather gently with the beetle. This opened the cleft a little more, so that the iron wedge came out pretty easily.

“I don’t see what makes the sides of the logs draw together so hard,” said he.

“O, they can’t help it,” said the boy.

“That is no reason,” rejoined he. “I should think that, after the log is once split open, it would stay so. If I split a piece of wood in two with my knife, the pieces don’t try to come together again.”

So he began to examine the log, and [Pg 39]to look into the cracks, to see if he could find out what it was that made the parts draw together so hard as to crush the walnut. Presently, he observed that the log was not split open from end to end. The crack commenced at one end, and extended nearly towards the other, but not quite; so that at this other end the log was solid and whole, just as it always had been. So he perceived that the two halves being joined and held together firmly here, they could only be separated at the other end by the wedge springing them open, and, of course, by their elasticity they tended to spring together again. Then besides, he saw, by looking into the crack, a great number of splinters, large and small, which extended obliquely from one side to the other, and bound the two sides strongly towards each other.

By this time the boy had got the wedge knocked out.

“It is strange,” said he, “that such a small wedge will split such a tough and solid log.”

“O, not very strange,” said the boy. “You see,” he continued, taking up the wedge, and pointing to the several parts as [Pg 40]he explained them, “you see here at this part, where it enters the wood it is sharp, and the sides spread out each way, so that, when I drive it in, they force the wood apart.”

“Why don’t they have the back of the wedge wider still? and then it would force the wood open farther; and then you would not have to put in a wooden wedge afterwards,—so,” he added, making a sign with his fingers. He put the tips of his fingers together, and then separated his hands, so as to represent a very blunt-shaped wedge.

“Then it would not drive in so easily,” answered the boy. “Perhaps I could not drive it in at all, if it was so blunt.”

“They might have the wedge longer then,” said he, “and then it would be just as tapering, and yet it would be a great deal broader at the back, because the back would be farther off.”

“That would make the wedge a great deal too heavy. It would not drive.”

“Why, yes, it would,” said he.

“No, it would not,” said the boy. “It would be just like a shoemaker’s lap-stone; pounding it would hardly move it.”

[Pg 41]

he did not understand what the boy meant by what he said about the shoemaker’s lap-stone; so he paused a moment, and presently he said,

“I don’t think it would make any difference, if it was heavy. And, besides, it might be made of wood, and that wouldn’t be heavy.”

“O, wood wouldn’t do,” said the boy.

Now it happened that while they had been talking, the boy had gone on driving in his wooden wedge into the cleft that the iron one had made, and it had been gradually splitting the log open more and more. So that just as the boy was saying that “a wooden wedge wouldn’t do,” he was actually seeing with his own eyes that it would do; for at that moment the boy gave the last blow, and the halves of the log came apart and fell over, one to one side, and the other to the other.

“Why, there,” said he, “you have split the log open with a wooden wedge.”
