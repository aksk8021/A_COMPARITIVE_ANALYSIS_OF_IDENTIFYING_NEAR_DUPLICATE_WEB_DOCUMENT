Weeks pass, during which we learn what this new life is. I win my gold stripe, I receive, in the company of Cigogne, the baptism of fire and we are both lucky not to be touched, while our comrade Tierspoint, a fat boy with a happy face, who was standing between us, received a shrapnel in the face, of which only a horrible and bloody mask remained.

You get used to these things, but we were no less sad at the evening soup. Everyone remembered Tierspoint's jovial laughter, and I saw again (I will always see again) his mown face, covered in red mush. Later, other wounds frightened me, chilled me with pity and dread, but not like Tierspoint's face. - We talked a lot about him, we appreciated his good humor, we declared that we were losing a good comrade, then we made a shackle, and others, whom the cards did not solicit or who were still thirsty, left. went to drink at the complacent innkeeper.

We slept, Cigogne and I, in a barn where we took up residence each time we spent the night in the cantonment. We felt there, so to speak, at home. It was a little too airy, the bats and rats carried on there, but these are small inconveniences. We could talk there, in the dark, and Cigogne sometimes darted a ray of his flashlight on the straw of our bed, so we liked to believe, for a moment, that the litter was gold. In good weather, the moonlight visited us and a thin blue ray pierced the shadows. We were silent as long as his presence lasted, or we spoke quieter.

Strange hours that remove all pain. You can dream at your ease, without sleeping, you can follow the moonbeam into the sky.

We were settled. We had made our bed by slow movements of the whole body, by very skilful crawling, and I was about to doze, the blanket pulled up to my chin, when Stork spoke:

“We end up not being moved anymore… Already the comrades who have been here longer than us are not paying any attention to it. They might have sung tonight, if given the chance... and yet... Do you see, Serval, a man wounded in the leg, in the arm, a man with a hole in his chest, we can recognize him: a bullet in the heart, it kills, but one remains oneself… Ah! that foreign face, that macabre carnival face he had! I won't say anything about it to my wife, by writing to her tomorrow (I write to her every day); the poor kid wouldn't sleep anymore… I watched him closely when we put him on the stretcher. No, it wasn't him! he was an unknown dead man, whom I had heard laughing.

"He was laughing well," I said; he laughed clearly.

"And you don't know, Serval, what was behind that laughter." I liked Tierspoint a lot, but his laugh was a bit cruel…too lying…too lying. He had suffered so much when he was little! These people, around him, in his village, seemed so sad, so gloomy! You can't be gay over there. He felt all the desolation of the beetroot plains.

- Let's go! I interrupted, we often laugh in the North…”

Stork continued:

"Think, Serval, think of the color of the twilight in Provence!... Tierspoint had doubtless wept, in winter, when, from his little attic room, at the very top of the farm, on the left, only a mooing of a cow from time to time, or the sound of a distant cart on the road. He was crying all alone, but he wanted to make the others forget their melancholy, so he had learned to laugh, to laugh as you say: to laugh well, to laugh clearly, and the others, hearing him laugh, laughed too. He had leftover goodness: he offered it to others, laughing. »

For a few moments, our moonbeam had been shooting its familiar blue arrow into the barn.

I listened to Cigogne, without understanding.

"But," I said to him, "did you know Tierspoint?"

- No, he replied, you do not understand. I hardly knew him. I knew next to nothing about him, but he died horribly and beautifully: he must have lived well. I had heard him laugh a lot; I wanted to know him… I know him now.

— Stork, you tell me stories. Please compose them, another time, on less painful subjects. »

I had offended him: his mouth tightened, his speech became dry.

“There are stupid people, all the same! When can you?…”

Then, in a friendlier voice and in the tone one adopts when explaining basic truths to a poor sympathetic fool, he added:

“Come on, Serval, put a little bit of yours into it! This man interested me; I watched him live with complacency, I saw him die and suddenly...

- No, you did not watch him live with complacency! you weren't looking at it at all! When he died, you fabricated a posthumous development about him!

"Shut that up!" Shut up!… I saw him die and suddenly he came back to life in front of me. Since that moment, he's been my friend… but let's be quiet, he's sleeping. Speak no more!…

- Stop talking, you'll do well. »

The bat had clung to its beam up there; the silence took shape; the night was stripped of its last sounds; we would be able to sleep.

“Don't be mad at me, Serval! you didn't understand. »

The bat was flying again, black and gray, in the shadows and in the moonlight.

I still heard a few muffled murmurs:

“Good night, my friend Tierspoint…sleep in peace. »

Cigogne really spoke to him; her voice was caught in tears. If he played a part, then he put his heart into it. Could we blame him? Soon he fell asleep. I was looking at the moonlight.

CHAPTER IX
From the lavender notebook.

Since Roger left, the house seems empty to me. It is raining. I'm bored. Is there that same sad weather over there? The evening passes very slowly: I look at a map of Alsace, but don't know exactly where it is, so it doesn't yet exist, as a country. Later, I will be able to say to myself: “He is there! » and I will learn by heart the names of the surrounding villages.

What a long day! The friends I meet, even when they have a husband, a brother in the army, don't interest me: they don't know how to talk about themselves; they talk bad about it. Will I be able to talk about him, me? In fact, perhaps it is best to be silent. However, I will have to continue to make visits, to take care of the house, as if he were there. Thus, Roger will seem less absent to me… I would so much like to see him, reading a book and closing it with a sudden gesture because a sentence displeased him!… No! he is not there.

It was to get bored that I thought of writing my diary, every evening, as I did when I was a young girl (in notebooks striped with yellow) and later, in Algiers, in little green notebooks, at when I met Roger. I had been afraid of him, the first times. I thought I was loved by a poet, an artist, as one imagines them!… Crazy that I was! And yet, sometimes I get scared for the same reasons, but it doesn't last. When he comes home from the cafe or from the club and says so much nonsense, dreams so much madness, I wonder if he loves me so much. What he says often seems very beautiful, but isn't he very far away?... Then he comes back to me, he sits down by the fire, he rolls his cigarette, and we talk... Now he left me for a long time. It is painful to live alone.

I threw my first notebooks into the fire; I'll keep these, whose lavender color I like, until Roger's return. What will they be used for later?

Roger told me that he was leaving with a rather pleasant comrade by the name of Cervalle or Serval. A painter, it seems. Roger would miss having no one to talk to about the things he loves and admires. Provided that this painter is a man of common sense!

Roger's first letters are quite short. He settles down, he makes contact, he gets used to it. His cantonment is in a village which, he says, revealed Alsace to him. I hope that soon his letters will be a little longer, but I'm not counting on that: he never liked to write, except for himself, in pencil, on a thousand scraps of paper. And then, maybe, he doesn't have time.

Roger seems very saddened by the death of a friend of his, named Tierspoint, whom he had never spoken to me about before. Killed close to him! ah! my God ! He tells me that the painter is a nice companion. His name is written Serval.

Madame Lure asked me to join her at the hospital tomorrow morning. No, my life won't be the same as before: the hospital will keep me busy. So much the better ! But the evenings will always be long.

What is Roger doing at the moment? What is he thinking?

CHAPTER X
Sitting in the trench, a plank resting on his knees, Cigogne dismantles his watch, whose fantasies worry him and make him nervous.

“To know people, you have to imagine them completely, he says, as if they were alive, as if they were dancing in front of you. Then we see them, then only. Hear me well: you don't see the character you are looking at, who is talking to you; you see what your mind pictures. Why look for a detail of a suit, the way he ties his shoelaces or his tie? Why note a character trait? All this will come to register without our thinking about it. In oneself, one tells oneself the man whom one wants to know. It is composed with materials brought in secret. One day, we see him: it is indeed him. This man is the real man. The other !… "

He made the gesture of putting aside something useless, importunate.

“The other is a ghost.

'That's called lying,' I told him, 'and in the most dangerous way, because it is, in fact, lying to oneself.

— On the contrary, he replied, it is to create a living world in a universe of appearances; it is to populate the life of real beings who happily double the game of the pale dolls that our eyes, our ears and our fingers reveal to us. Ah! the imaginary world! how sweet it is to represent it to ourselves according to our needs, our curiosities, our dreams, to mask the other! how he consoles the other! how quickly it will destroy the other, the awful unreal world of flesh and bones that my caretaker sees!

'That way,' I told him, 'you distort your view of things forever; the truth becomes a simple matter of feeling and mood. »

He was losing patience:

“Go and evangelize naked men in Borneo! Here is your place! Go teach them the truth! Go quickly ! Go for a walk under the palms with a black book in your hand, dressed in a long frock coat and wearing a helmet with a green veil! »

His look took pity on me.

“The truth, Serval, is not at the bottom of the well. Well water in Alsace is always dirty. Read the sign: “Well cured… water not drinkable. “If I looked for it, what truth would I find deep down?…”

I handed him a cog from his watch that he had dropped.

“Thank you, old man!… The truth, Serval, does not reside in the wells any more than the ideal time resides in my watch. What time is it ? »

CHAPTER XI
Cigogne is loved by all our comrades; they appreciate in him a very special ability to put themselves within their reach, without letting him see or feel. Cigogne knows how to talk to them, he is interested in their lives, their adventures, the anxieties, the worries that torment them. If he allows himself, too often, while chatting with me, oddities of language which dress ideas themselves odd, certainly, I am the only witness. — Ask the men of our battery their opinion of the quartermaster Maxence, better known under the name of Stork, everyone will declare that he is a good guy, a brave fellow, not proud. This is a badge of homage. “It cannot be said that he makes an effort to show himself in such a pleasant light; this game comes naturally to him, this game amuses him and I am also amused to see him in his various roles. Secretly, silently,

“Well done, Stork! »

But sometimes I don't like the play.

Brigadier Chert is getting married. His nuptials coincide with the eight-day leave he is about to take. This young thug is very unsympathetic to me. He talks about the upcoming ceremony with a crude cynicism that hurts me.

"And to church again!" like the bourgeois!... an idea of ​​the family!... Hortense is going to fuck herself in a white dress! Ah! I'll laugh for my money!

"You mean for his?" interjects Cigogne, with the most charming smile.

The joke is considered tasteful, witty and delicate.

“A joke, the stork margis! a real ! exclaims this little scoundrel.Raymond Chert does not let us ignore that the one who will soon be Mrs. Chert has known him for several years, very closely. He describes it to us in detail. — Cigogne puts on his most attentive air. I'm stamping. Chert adds some garbage to her first story. - By the way, why this marriage? - Oh! here is ! his fiancée's great-uncle has just died and his will makes Mlle Hortense a person who can and must be married. She has other lovers, but it is he, Brigadier Raymond Chert, whom she adores.

Suddenly he turns to Cigogne.

"Marshal, will you think of me on the wedding day?"

"I will try," replies Cigogne gravely.

And, a few moments later, as we walk together in the cantonment:

“Singular boy,” he said to me. Oh ! I realize that he's not worth the rope to hang him, but… what if he finds Miss Hortense other than he imagined, after these long months of war?

- Well ?

- It would be very hard for him ... it must be very hard to be wrong like that.

"That's all the same to me!" »

Stork seems sorry. He shakes his head; he despairs of my understanding, of my sensitivity.

“My friend, your heart is rock! »

CHAPTER XII
From the lavender notebook.

Roger is not a child, but from childhood he retains something in his human nature: gaiety, at first, when the weather is fine, a charming gaiety, then an extraordinary faculty for distraction ; I saw him, during a serious talk where he offered his condolences on the subject of a recent bereavement, suddenly start laughing and clapping his hands because a sparrow had landed on the edge of the window ! I was very ashamed of it! Finally, he is too easily influenced.

With Mahoudiaux, whom he has known for twenty years, he is at ease, he lives, as he says himself, "his bourgeois hours"; with his friends in the circle (those who don't bother him too much), he discusses municipal politics and city gossip, bitterly... It seems that he is interested in it, and God knows that such questions leave him cold ! “It would be quite simple if the influence only lasted for the duration of a conversation, but it is perpetuated. Roger is subject to influences like other people have measles: he must be treated and cured.

In this notebook where I feel in confidence with myself (it is in confidence that it should be said), I acknowledge that, sometimes, I am less worried about the accidents of war which can strike Roger than more numerous influences and so strong that he will find at the front. I'm afraid that some of his comrades seem to him original, singular, bizarre and that he wants to imitate them... no, I'm wrong... that he wants to admire them, to understand them too well, as if it were his duty . He does this for the books he reads, and that's very fair (although he sometimes goes a bit too far in this direction), but for living people, isn't it dangerous?

He would scold me if he was there! He would say to me: “Lucienne, you want to philosophize and you only manage to moralize in a very mediocre way. He only has to look into my heart to see that he is wrong.

I love it, that's all! I think I know him, I want to find out what he thinks, what he feels… But isn't that precisely what I blamed him for earlier? - No ... no ... Ah! it would be a very terrible adventure for a confessor to provoke and listen to the confession of a penitent only to think better afterwards and feel like him! - I want to cure Roger ... Come on! Here I am, again, in the midst of mediocre morals!

Maurice Mahoudiaux writes to me that he has only received three "worthless" postcards from Roger. He forgets that Roger has a lot of work to do and that writing is tiring. The days at the front must be terrible, but a giant like our dear Mahoudiaux readily believes that everyone has the same resistance as him!

"I hope," he said again, "that from this war which will surely end soon, Roger will come back with the idea that he is Napoleon, Caesar or some other victorious and famous general." Even if he does not touch glory, he must imagine it. Believe me, my dear Lucienne, the slightest Leipzig would give us in Roger a dreadful Waterloo and a very boring Saint Helena! »

What does he mean ? He does not speak randomly. Leipzig? I remember the date, 1813, but what connection? I'm going to take a volume of Thiers from the library and relearn my Empire wars. However, I think I know them a little.

All the same, Roger should have written more often to Mahoudiaux. I counted so much on the influence of Maurice!

Who is this Raymond Chert Roger is telling me about?

I saw some terrible wounds in the hospital! Mme Cartesque 's daughter tells me that I don't appreciate “their beauty”! She shows herself to be full of devotion, she is always there for the operations, for the dressings, but… I can't express my thoughts… Come on, a wound, in short, it's always ugly. We can admire the man who… no, I mean: we can admire the courage of the man who… Anyway, I lose myself!

I must have been grossly mistaken about Raymond Chert, that strange boy Roger still tells me about. He's in a lot of pain…yes, definitely, and my idea of ​​him was pretty uncharitable.

Ah! I understand ! Leipzig, an indecisive battle… Then Roger would lose heart and, if he got into trouble afterwards, he would take it badly.

"I especially hope that nothing will happen to him!" The rest, the glory, he can do without: he has his home, he has his wife.

CHAPTER XIII
Yesterday I was describing to Cigogne a certain painting I was finishing when the declaration of war took away all pictorial concern from me. The subject seemed to please him, he even showed himself enthusiastic about it, but, although I had made him a sketch to guide his imagination a little and better place the figures, I fear that he wanted to see more things in it than I hadn't put them there, especially others.

The background of the canvas was occupied by large severe rocks in shades of ocher, above which rose, steeply sloping, forests, snows, then glaciers of a milky blue and luminous at the same time , under a purple sky, very light. In the foreground, a thin strip of green grass gave a rather raw feel. On this grass, poor people were squatting or lying: two ploughmen, a farm hand, a gypsy, an old woman rolled up in a dirt blanket, and, on the far right, a little red-haired girl, kneeling, her hair dishevelled, hands held high, mouth agape. Main figure, standing in the center of the composition, at the edge of the green lawn, a witch presented to this humble and sprawling audience a large irregular block of crystal in which, as in still water, vague reflections floated. All the faces were stretched towards this crystal and I was interested in painting on each one a similar and yet different emotion of curiosity, nuanced with astonishment, joy, worry or mystical delight. All looked, all wanted to see, and the witch, dressed in dark red clothes, profiled on the ocher rocks, her brown head standing out against the bluish glaciers and the mauve sky, presented her crystal to all and smiled with an air of contemptuous malice.

The contrast of blues, mauves and a translucent gray with the thick ochres, reds, green and some opaque yellows had been a lot of fun for me to process. Besides, all that remained unfinished was the second plowman lying on the grass and the little girl's torso. The figures were half life size.

“Well,” I asked Cigogne, “can you picture it? »

He seemed moved and did not know what to answer; then, in an unsteady voice:“What was your thought, he said, when you made this painting? He upsets me.

— It's very simple: I wanted to group around this single upright figure all these other low figures; add to that some search for expression and, as for the color, it seemed interesting to me to add transparent tones to the day and others not very bright. This was my biggest job and forced me to do a lot of research. I hope you will like my canvas, when I can show it to you. One can hardly give an honest impression of a painting by words. I need my palette. A few colors would offer fairer approximations than the most subtle, the most sought-after phrases. This is the downside of art criticism. Would we use the rainbow to clearly express philosophical ideas? No, isn't it? »

He didn't say a word, he wasn't listening to me anymore, he was dreaming. Suddenly, looking down at me and regaining consciousness, Cigogne seemed to come back to earth.

'I understand what you meant,' he murmured in a troubled voice; these poor people see in the crystal the magic forms of their spirit; they contemplate themselves as they will be, as they should be; they question their future, they discount the day that is coming, they anticipate their life, in a way, and the haughty malice which stretches the mouth of your witch proves it well. She knows the power of her crystal; he unites in himself so many dreams! Your two ploughmen, your old wife, your farmhand (in clogs, I think), your gypsy, who has traveled a lot, and the little red-haired girl would have admired the blue glaciers, the dark slopes of the forests, the ocher rocks that border them; they would have surrendered to the day-to-day life, but your witch, by her crystal, prevents them from doing so,

- Yes, I interrupted, with an air of bad humor, yes, no doubt, but all that is not painting! »

And yet, I saw my canvas again, listening to Cigogne, and I noticed that the posture of my farmhand was wrong and the brown tone of his coat too dark. “Nevertheless, I repeated, out of self-respect:

“All this is not painting! »

I was also convinced of it.

" Never mind ! replied Cigogne, setting out again for a distant country; I am not a painter! »
