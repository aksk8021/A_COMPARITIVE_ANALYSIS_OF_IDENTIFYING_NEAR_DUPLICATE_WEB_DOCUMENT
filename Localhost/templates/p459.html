From No. 102 of the fourth Aftonbladet on May 26, 1836, under the heading: Literature, read a review of notes on the campaigns against Russia in the years 1808 and 1809 by Carl Johan Holm, acting Regiment-Pastor at Savolax Jägare-Regemente . This review is one of the most dignified and most rewarding rewards for the remnants of the Finnish Army, for the past dangers and endured hardships. Especially if there were any among these who, by one event or another, had been unfairly overlooked in the distribution of Military Rewards, which could so easily happen to even the best - the most impartial Commander.

This expression of national recognition and benevolence truly outweighs stars, bands and titles; at least for the wise man. For him it must be more satisfying to be able, with a good conscience, to acquire the appropriate share of such a reward, than if he had received without particular distinction a Medal of Bravery or a Star of the Order of the Sword, which is not always awarded for war and thus does not always prove much.

The reward thus given belongs not only to those decorated by the Finnish Army, it belongs from and including the Drummer to the Commander, if not for great deeds, at least for steadfast faith and perseverance in the defense of the motherland. It belongs to all, except the few weak ones, who, like morbid idiots, surrendered themselves to the power of the enemy and thus forever branded their names.

A Nation that gives public expression of respect and recognition for the warrior's efforts to fulfill his duties shall never lack a good - a brave army. In this way the youth's love for life is lived - he can not wish for a more beautiful lot, than to be allowed to dedicate life and blood to the King and Citizens. But this is by no means done by trying to soil the military youth with printing ink for a slight and unexpected surprise. Perhaps one should thus be more frugal and meticulous in our country, in regard to its influence on the National mood itself, which, in view of our geographical location, should be belligerent. In any case, the sane citizen can not fail to see where the cause of the conflict came from - and the haste punished according to the country, not according to foreign laws, must satisfy everyone.

But this review, so flattering to the Finnish army, is evoked by a writing which would cast a dark shadow on this army, if the author had been one of its Militaira members. Scripture exalts the merits of the Army to the skies, especially the Savolax Brigade, to which the Author has been a kind of appendage while a vile accusation is directed against its Higher Commander. A lowness so common among the great warlords, who after the end of the war appear, after all dangers, all difficulties and troubles are over, to trumpet from their desks with the pen how much wiser and braver they would have acted, if they had led the Command and arranged the companies.

Yes, CJ Holm, Pastor of the Regiment, probably showed how Finland could be defended with the Finnish army against the Russian superiority; how it could easily have been regained, even since it was lost. But it was not very loving of Herr Holm against the Fatherland, to keep his great ability hidden, while there was still time.

I thank, however, the Providence that this shabby Author does not belong to my Brothers in Arms. Nobler ways of life enlivened them than they would allow themselves to cast dirt on these Commanders, who had so many times brought us to honor and glory, who shared with us toil, renunciation, and danger. The author belongs to a state from which one has expected the milder language of oversight, against the imperfections of mankind, even with a Commander. But he has condescended to the tongue of blasphemy.

I would gladly have left Mr. Holm's notes in silence to their deserved fate, if he had not, with such unusual carelessness, imposed on my deceased Brother Hans Excellence, etc., Count Adlercreutz and all the High Commanders of the Army: to have given false reports, to have employed amusement games. human life and to have, at the expense of others, sought to exalt their glory.

The respective Public may apologize: that I can not with sufficient coldness see a Brother's memory thus attacked; and although I acknowledge my stylistic ability to be small, to be measured by Mr. Holms, who seems to be as great in the military as in the evangelical knowledge, I am still compelled to dare to battle with this Buse, and thus expose me to all the discomfort Mr. Holm is able to inflict on a battlefield, where he is already more at home than I am, and which he has recently exclaimed with some such beautiful recognitions.

I begin my attack with the question:

Why has Mr. Holm so carefully accelerated his notes and his knowledge so far?

Now, with the death of the General and Count JA Cronstedt, all the men have descended into the grave whom Herr Holm, through his notes and judgments, attacks to honor and glory. They can no longer arise to defend it and rebuke the attacker, who, with the dignity of his estate, considered compatible, to disturb the rest of the dead in the grave. - He has assumed that the deceased no longer had any friends in life who could or wanted to defend their hitherto immaculate name.

See there the only answer, which the value the Author can give to my question.

For in vain does he invoke his love for the truth. It would have won more if he had published his notes while those affected by it were alive and able to fully investigate every blamed situation. Now these notes must be counted among the outpourings of insult.

On the first and second pages of the book, the Author says: “ With a force of 20,000 men, in a country as cut through as Finland, much could be accomplished; at the many advantageous passes, a small force can easily hinder and sustain superior enemies. "(Now it was still winter), but on the fifth page the Author already says:

" Although the enemy in winter, when the ice was everywhere navigable, could penetrate Savolax on five separate roads. ”

What was the use of the advantageous passes and watercourses, of which Finland was cut?

The passes could now be bypassed on the ice and the watercourses overrun with both Cavalry and Artillery.

Already this inconsequence in opinions so close to each other, gives something close to announcing the author's content and value and what trust one can attach to its judgments. It can be rightly said of him that he noticed the grandeur in the Commander's eye but not the beam in his own.

On the other hand, Mr. Holm begins to develop his beautiful military views, with the question: “ Who has been able to blame the Finnish army for it, seeing the wretched institutions, etc. - if it has lost heart, saddened and returned to its abode? ”

Then I answer on behalf of myself and my brothers-in-arms: that we have been gifted by our enemies and had deserved it. The citizens who had now so kindly reviewed Mr. Holm's writing against the Finnish Army had then justly despised and called us wretches - and in such a case Mr. Holm himself had not now sat down to a good piece of bread and Kongl. The Wasa Order in the territory of this homeland, which silenced his ambition as a writer and spared the remnants of the Finnish army from such clumsy questions as this.

His further reasoning on the same and the following pages reveals Herr Holm's complete unfamiliarity with honor and a real militair-esprits claims. He states that nothing but " the faithfulness and innate bravery of the Finnish people - - the army's reverence and affection planted for the King from childhood and a hatred of the Russians infused with breast milk " should have kept the Finnish army under its banner.

The Finnish Army had nevertheless sworn its flags to defend them with life and blood - not to abandon them until death - the flags were Swedish and Sweden was our homeland. But the author, the clergyman of the Regiment, still allows himself to be asked if anyone could blame the Army, in case it betrayed its oath and betrayed itself in the power of the enemy! It was not the given promise, with an oath confirmed, that bound the Army to its flags, it was the fear of the faith and bravery of the Finnish people that kept the Finnish Army to its duties. Preserve God, for such Preachers!

The Finnish Commander knew that the Army had a war weapon to preserve, taken from the plains of Lützen, and I hope one admits that this commander has mustered all his ability to defend it. This is all that the Finnish Army has done. But this preserved war spirit is a treasure, the value of which Mr. Holm does not seem to have any idea.

Mr Holm claims that the Savolax Brigade, of which he claims to have been an eyewitness (probably always without a shot), must have been the core of the Finnish Army. In this regard, I can assure with full certainty that Mr Holm significantly offends the truth. Well, the Savolax Brigade was part of the nucleus, because the Finnish Army mostly consisted of nuclei.

That the Savolax Brigade should always be the retreat of the Army at the retreat is an obvious untruth, since this Brigade did not until after 27 April 1808 encounter the other army, which had already made a considerable retreat, and during this several times fought with the enemy. .

That the same Brigade participated in all the main battles of the great Finnish Army (if it can be called that) is also a ditto untrue. The affair at Sikajocki is considered by all those who understand something to be one of the most important for several reasons; but in particular, because it reproduced the Finnish Army's initiatives or changed its relationship from defense to offensive; because the Finnish Army here for the first time had to put up a serious resistance to the Russians; because a significant number of prisoners, trophies etc. were made here

These considerable inaccuracies in information should inform Mr. Holm that it is not so easy to be a Militair writer and War Judge, and that you do not have genius even though you are crazy, as one of Sweden's great writers said.

The total lack of arrangements for a serious war, which existed in Finland in 1808, is so widely known that the author could well have saved his weak technicality from it, just as I spare my remarks on it.

The individual conditions, movements and struggles of the Savolax Brigade, I feel too incomplete, to allow me any opinion on this; but it reproaches the author Holm considered it worthy to let everywhere shine against his Brigadier-General and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, I shall, if not fully refute, at least to a considerable extent diminish.

The author presents the Magazins facility in St. Michel, who is too careless, but is nevertheless so conscientious that he leaves the judgment to others, presumably as reprehensible, dares to happen even as selfish, because the Magazine was burned shortly afterwards; but how much of the beautiful grain and hay stores left to the flames, the author has considered too inconvenient to state. However, the thing was welcome. It gave reason to blame the Commander.

The relation herewith, however, is as follows: that when the Break-up Orders of the Finnish Army were issued, Rust- and Root-holders throughout the Country were urged, out of love for the general good, to provide their crew, Cavalry and Tross horses with Proviant and Fourage for one month, which those with readiness everywhere completed at the Troopers' gathering places. It is now this livelihood along with a small procurement for the recruited Corps, which the author makes into a large Magazine formation, for which in Finland at the outbreak of the war there was no money, Kongl. Maj: t and Kronan belong.

Later in the writing, however, the author shouts like an eagle about the lack of food in the few and scattered neighborhoods, despite so much being brought from the Magazine in St. Michel. Will the lack of food, if you have not had anything with you - if you have neglected all consideration in this respect, become less?

That the Savolax Brigade as a whole remained so long in St. Michel, until one could with some certainty foresee how and where the enemy wanted to break into the Land, is not to be blamed by anyone other than the author Holm. It is known that a combined force impresses esteem, as on the other hand an enemy can wish for nothing better than to have his opponent's Here spread in Detachements along the border, like the Swedish against Norway in 1808. The brigade commander's confidence in the sure connoisseurs with whom he had surrounded the brigade, after Holm, is so anxious about its remnant, and in his heavenly wisdom foretells events which nevertheless do not occur.

Elsewhere, the Brigadier General is blamed for abandoning the Brigade's homeland too quickly and without a hitch, and here for not immediately shaving it off. Which mische-masche in thoughts and opinions?

The brigade commander's duty was to place the brigade's movements in connection with the rest of the army, which he did to the satisfaction of the Supreme Commander, with which Holm could also be satisfied.

His statement in these respects is a genuine Holmic boast, with his better knowledge.

I do not allow myself to believe that Brigadier-General Count Cronstedt should let the Brigade, under the false rumor, stand all night under rifles, so that the people plunged to the ground in the cold; one must like the Count's precautionary measure of keeping the Brigade together, especially since he might sometimes have to wait for a Battalion for a whole hour, as happened in Paavola; even that he did not allow Bivouaqueeldar. But on the other hand, you can reasonably blame Mr. Battalion Commanders, if the crew did not get behind the Battalion's connected rifle stir and jump warm. The Savolax Brigade, which was to be the core of the Army, should not have been more clumsy than the rest of us, who without quail fires often had to stand on field guards in the same cold. It was thus not worthwhile for the author to intend to amaze all readers with such wonders. Count Cronstedt, if he were still alive, would surely have rebutted the Author for even more compelling reasons; but for the Author's own reputation it would have been better if he had stayed closer to the probability.

Here it is now in order to remark: that the Corps, which wanted to be considered the core of the Finnish Army, did not have the guts, let alone to express its dissatisfaction with the measures taken by the Brigadier General as a result of orders and instruction. This is otherwise called a crime against tuk and war obedience.

The Brigadier General himself, like the rest of us in the Army, had been forced to abandon his home, his wife and children. We fought when required, but we were not so brave that we knotted and expressed loud dissatisfaction when we were forced to retreat. Our self-love did not trust itself to better understand the best interests of the Army and the Fatherland, than our Higher Commanders.

The claim that Count Cronstedt gave a false report about the insignificant affair at Läppävirta is, to say the least, an unforeseen shamelessness. Count Cronstedt's instruction not to engage in any decisive battle or to unnecessarily expose his troops, but to go north and cover the road to Oulu, put him beyond all need to untruthfully cover his retreat from Läppävirta and the little resistance he made there. It is thus quite it is unbelievable that a higher Commander, without any need, would expose his reputation, by uttering such a shabby untruth.

The author has also only calculated the calculation of the Brigade's strength in and around Läppävirta, as Count Cronstedt in the report only included the troops who participated in the battle, where the Brigade's eyewitness probably did not dare to count the roots. What confidence can then be put in view of the witness' denial of the accuracy of the report.

Of equal content and value is the Author's account of the forgotten entry in Jyngkkäby.

When this posting was postponed, it received a ratio order.

I can not even see: that when the Brigadier General considered this instruction sufficient for all events, that he somehow had the necessity to inform the Posting Chief what the Brigade was leavingKuopio across the strait toToivola ½ miles, just to prove to Mr. Holm that he did not forget the same.

But after Herr Holm's presentation it appears that Capitaine Dunker has neglected her duty to report as soon as the posting of the enemy was attacked, and thus to a greater extent violated the prescribed observations, than the Brigade Commander. The outcome also shows that no further order was necessary.

But among the many ridicules which occur in this writing almost everywhere, may be mentioned here the Author's expression: Our Canon . We priesthood, said the bell-ringer, or could the canon proclaim the teachings of the Gospel and thus be a Priestly canon?

Courage was certainly required here, as on all occasions when it comes to the loss of arms, legs or life; but some special disposition — some heroism, I see, could not be revealed here, especially since the author admits that the snow, which covered the ice, was so deep that the Cavalry attack lost all influence; not or has the author tried to give up any heroic deed which has been practiced thereby, except Cornett Dunkers, for which reason he was also decorated.

None of the Finnish Army disregards or denies the Captain Dunkers and Malm's qualities and merits. With respect and friendship, their memories are honored by the remnants of the Finnish Army. Here again it should not be forgotten how the Author states that the Cavalry attacks on the ice were repulsed with grape shot Salvos , although the detachment had only a single cannon with it.

The noble author states on page 13: " No one should be surprised that Count Cronstedt does not include in his report: that he and his Adjutants at the Brigade's retreat from Kuopio forgot the whole field guard. ”

Is this language worthy of a servant of religion, who professes zeal for the truth? as truth, he seeks to impose on the Reader his own foolish suspicions, which he can not with the slightest proof manage. He should have reminded himself that he was not speaking in the pulpit now.

Furthermore, the author states that Count Cronstedt, in order to diminish Dunkers and Malm's merits, states that the Field Guard received support in addition to Artillery and Cavalry 2nd Battalions.

By itself, one judges others, it is a recognized and indisputable truth. Some proof that the motive for such a Count Cronstedt's presentation was to obscure the merits of his subjects, the friend of truth, Holm, has not been able to make known.

Here he imposes on Count Cronstedt a humiliation to which he himself has been capable. And what reason could a Commander have for such an envy against the subordinate Commander's skill, ability and merit, which usually tends to constitute a Commander's satisfaction and greatest joy; but that Count Cronstedt did not do a miracle of a fairly ordinary thing, Mr. Holm can not so easily forgive.

At the march route drawn up by Herr Holm over the Brigade's Train to and from Oulu, it is not particularly noticeable; but the eternal knot, which Mr. Holm from this Brigade makes echo above all, could really diminish it, from the core, to one, of self-love and dissatisfaction with everything, mask-heavy and fragile, if the military members thereof participated in such a bad esprit, which nevertheless never became noticeable until Herr Holm's writing saw the light of day.

After describing his field efforts during the brigade's retreat with particular exaggeration, he states on the 16th page: “ Our expected and promised rest in Oulu was quite short. ”

Who had promised and who could promise a longer rest? The author has not stated this.

Hereafter Herr Holm fixes his shrewd eye and his penetrating judgment against General Adlercreutz, while Count Cronstedt gets something to catch his breath; but as usual, the acquaintance begins with a mistake or untruth.

Kl. 8 a.m. on April 26, Ordres departed from the Headquarters of Limmingo, to Count Cronstedt in Paavola, regrettably, not as Herr Holm says, by Courier, but, by mistake, by an Adjutant at the Staff, by letter post. - This Order, however, had certainly arrived at 2 or 3 eft. m., when between the Headquarters and Paavola is not more than 40 miles, when the time should be sufficient for the Brigade to be able to occur in time and place.

Mr. Holm admits that the Fourth Brigade heard between 3 and 4 o'clock that battle at Refvola had begun from elsewhere, but notwithstanding the Brigade then had time to speed up the march, at least it continued without a break and thus in a few hours had boarded considerably, Mr. Holm nevertheless managed did not hear that the beginning of the battle was fiercest between kl. 6 and 7. The danger of his life and fear sanctified to Heaven, had probably already then clogged the auditory organs.

With no proof other than his own limited judgment, the author allows himself to accuse Adjutant-General Adlercreutz of having given a false report - yes, he feels compelled to do so, by what, it is difficult to understand - if not out of his contempt.

On page 18, the Author states: “ At the slightest reflection, it must also seem impossible, that with 150 men, attacking nearly 3,000, to continue the battle for four hours without holding any particularly strong position. ”

But it is also a definite untruth that the Russian force in Revolax exceeded 2,500 men, and it is readily admitted that it would have been unreasonable for 150 men to attack it, if it had not taken place in conjunction with the 4th Brigade, which would do the real thing. the attack.

Although it is disgusting to make a presentation that may have the appearance of boasting, I am here also forced to suppress this sense of neighborliness in order to rebuke the careless Priest.

With the post in Lankinen under Lieutenant Blums at Pori Regiment Command, consisting of 100 men from the said Regiment and 50 men from Hämeenlinna Regiment with necessary Commander-in-Chief and Sub-Command, Adjutant-General Adlercreutz broke up around kl. ½2 in the morning of April 27, 1808. During a quiet and slow march we approached Revolax, often making stops to hear if the Fourth Brigade's attack had begun. At around 3 o'clock we were discovered by a Cosack Patrol very close to the Cosack guard. - The choice between returning or attacking, was hastily taken. Lieutenant Blum and I, with 40 men each, were ordered to immediately rush at the Cosack guard, who fled with the saddles in hand. We formed Jägarekedja and continued the march forward about 1,600 cubits through a sparse small forest. Arriving at the plain, we encountered the Russian Infantry Field guard about 100 men strong. Covered at the edge of the forest, where we stopped, a lively fire was maintained here for almost an hour, all in anticipation of the arrival of the 4th Brigade, or also that the Russians would at least with some considerable force turn against us and we could thus light the 4th Brigade attack. But when neither happened, Lieutenant Blum and I were ordered to seize with the bayonet the Rij buildings, from which the Russians maintained a rather fierce fire against our troop; this was accomplished with the usual cheer and succeeded well. The Russians abandoned their advantageous position; in Rijan some and 30 prisoners were taken, several of whom were wounded, who, however, at first wished to defend themselves; but after some had been shot down into Rijan, they stretched out the other rifles.

Another area of ​​forest separated us from the fields surrounding Prestgården, and we were ordered to immediately advance there. Out in the woods we came across a strong Jägar chain, which 2 times repossessed us. We had not already been insignificantly wounded, when we received a reinforcement of 30 men from Pori, after which we quickly enough cleared the forest with the bayonet and with the cheerful cheers; several Russian wounded prisoners were captured here. Arriving at the forest edge, we made a halt, and a report was sent that the entire Russian force was under rifle, lined up in front of Prestgården, when we immediately with renewed ammunition, were ordered to maintain a lively fire with the Russians' Hunter Chain, but by no means advance on the plain.

To my right I had a small forest hill jutting out into the field, from where I thought I could direct my troop fire with better advantage and even better observe the enemy's companies on the other side of the hill. The plain, which separated me from the hill, was not more than 30 cubits wide, but at the transition from it I received a severe injury which interrupted my further activity here. - I have thus with my blood fulfilled this simple story and that at. now I was close to seven, I can certify with a clear conscience, Mr. Holm to little honor, who has rested in the grave for 21 years, wants to charge him with the disgrace of having given a false report.

Then, by bathing in cold water to prevent bleeding, since no connection here could take place in the absence of Fältskär, I withdrew from the battle, I was taken by my brother's officer in his sleigh to Lumijocki. When I heard the first cannon shot along the way, I asked my brother's officer what time it was, and he answered ½ to 9. If you subtract the half hour for the sound to reach my ear and any difference between the clockwise movement is allowed, then it was at. at least 8 when the 4th Brigade began its attack. Mr. Holm has, however, shown some kind of sense of honor here, when he sought to excuse the Brigade's slowness to which he was an appendage, but it is nevertheless ugly to seek to bring about the excuse at the expense of the truth.

Mr Holm says: “ It is certain that the Russians, after beating and pursuing Adlercreutz, regained their quarters and had breakfast as best they could. ”

Again 2nd great untruths, neither Detachement under Adlercreutz was defeated, nor did the Russians pursue him a single step. Maybe they were happy to avoid his greeting. Nevertheless it is likely that General Gearnault was sent to pursue Adlercreutz; but he went, without firing a shot, straight to Sikajocki with his 500 men. Adlercreutz, on the other hand, having continued the battle against such a superior force for four hours to await Cronstedt's arrival, then believed that orders had not come to him, and therefore considered it pointless to continue the battle, wherefore he, without attack from the Russians, retired.

On page 19 it is further stated: “ Likewise, I must dispute what Count Klingsporr and Colonel Adlercreutz state in their reports: the Colonel's attack at. between 3 and 4 contributed to the victory that Count Cronstedt with the 4th Brigade later fought for. ”

The prisoners taken in the morning, the dead shot and wounded whom the Russians received during the earlier battle, but in particular General Gearnault's retreat to Sikajocki, which was entirely a consequence of Colonel Adlercreutz's attack, are said to have contributed little to Count Cronstedt's victory; if the moral impact of a previous bold attack from the very opposite side is calculated for this, then Mr. Holm should learn to admit that Adlercreutz in some mohn contributed to the later victory, which would be proved.

That it would have been Adlercreutz's intention: to diminish the real merit of his brother-in-law, Count Cronstedt, and the 4th Brigade, in order to thereby elevate his own, is, to put it mildly, a Holmian ugliness, generated in his mediocre brain, or even in conversation with the youngest of The commander. The brigade's praiseworthy relationship wants and can no one disputes, but who therefore may not with reason be elevated to rank and dignity with wonders and great deeds, as Mr. Holm seems to have claimed, the enlightened Public learns to apologize.

" That the Brigadier General, when he was to make the device for attack, was certainly in a difficult situation ," says Mr. Holm. He thus wants to attract us to what we believe is school: that he stood by the side of the Brigadier General, thus in the lead, where Count Cronstedt usually took his place; but in our enlightened age, Jesuits are not believed.

That Count Cronstedt did not have the slightest knowledge of the enemy's strength in Revolax is a further untruth. The orders to him of April 26, 1808, countersigned by Baron v. Knorring, contained that General Bulatoff's force was about 2,500 men, on whom the Count was to rely, without further ado. He was obliged to obtain the position of the enemy himself and to inspect it on the spot. If I were to allow myself any remark against this honest man's actions at Revolax, based on Holm's description, I would think that he made a fundamental mistake, as he shared his strength sooner than on the battlefield. The outcome also showed that he had more inconvenience than benefit from it, but I prevent myself from easily blaming a General's action with one if here, and a ditto there, it can each crofter and tailor, but do better when it comes to, should be more difficult; therefore I keep silent.

That the whole outcome would be due to the coldness and disposition of the Collonne and Battalion Commanders, as the author says, because Cronstedt in his report expressed what he had to thank Providence condition for the happy ending. Does the Regimental Priest, then, mean that one does not always have to thank the Providence's mission for a happy outcome, even when it is not due to the coldness and disposition of the Colonel and Battalion Commander? The fact that General Gearnault, with his regiment set up at cannon fire distance from Revolax, should have heard the battle in disarray, as Herr Holm states, further increases his sin register with untruth.

While I was wounded in Oulu, I had the honor of making General Bulatoff's acquaintance. He himself stated that his force in Revolax, after Gearnault's retreat, had been 1,500 men. Thus, if Mr. Holm never so many times renews his claim and his information, that the Russians were 3,000, I must regard such as merely renewed untruths.

" Had the storm occurred an hour later, it would probably have failed ," says Mr. Holm. On the other hand, I would like to remark: that if it had happened an hour earlier, as it could and had done, it would certainly have gone better than now, and then probably the whole Russian distribution would have been taken.

It is really fitting for the former Regiment-Priest Holm to perform his duties, judging Adlercreutz as an unwise leader, and to call on both contemporary and posterity to judge him as such. Is it thus the effort of an honest man to serve the fatherland to the best of his ability to be rewarded? Providence might not have endowed him with such great qualities as Mr. Holm, but he loved honor, the fatherland, and the truth above all else, and every moment he was ready to sacrifice his life for them, then he gave his citizens several proofs. That he was not a great statesman - only a brave soldier, the great Captain Lindeberg has written - and who can further doubt that? But it was still wrong that Finnen, officiating Regiment-Priest Holm, should put onions on the salmon.

If Adlercreutz had any Battalions with him, he would have been able to endure the battle until the Savolax Brigade (the 4th, Mr. Holm, although he has no idea about it) had arrived, and then the whole of the Russian at Revolax would unconditionally arrive. the distribution has been taken, says the Author. Had the same not happened if the 4th Brigade had appeared on the battlefield in due time? It was thus not Adlercreutz's fault, but the fault of the 4th Brigade, that not all the Russians in Revolax were captured. That Adlercreutz had with him three whole idle brigades is not true, and if these were not needed to cover the great road, I do not allow myself to judge. But if the Russians had received a greater reinforcement of it and attacked it, it would have been more dangerous if Adlercreutz had used the troops from this side, for the whole Army, than if the 4th Brigade had been rejected. In any case, the outcome shows that the strength used against Revolax was sufficient. Mr. Holm had thus agreed to forgive Adlercreutz that he was acting in this way according to his own, and not according to Mr. Holm's head. Admittedly, I also believe that Adlercreutz, without all the assistance of the 4th Brigade, able to defeat the Russians at Revolax; but the 4th Brigade had not seen any enemy since the retreat from Toivola on 15 March; on the other hand the other 3rd Brigades had been defeated on 16 April at Kalajocki and on 18 at Sikajocki. Mr. Holm himself has also said that since the Brigade loudly expressed its dissatisfaction with not having been allowed to fight, and also expressed their burning desire to compete with the Russians, it would have been hard to prevent the Brigade from earning the stock it now acquired.

But that General a Chief Count Klingsporr therefore became Field Marshal, Adlercreutz General-Major (which nevertheless happened for the Sikajocki affair) and Count Cronstedt Knight of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sword, without Herr Holm not even getting his testimony and disposal a Cardinals hat, was good hard melted.

Mr. Holm's reasoning on page 28 is of such a low nature that it should not be based on any Swedish printing house. He makes the Finnish Commander-in-Chief, Field Marshal Count Klingsporr, Adjutant General Adlercreutz, no less than the traitor of the Fatherland. Men who, until their death, nevertheless enjoyed the esteem and benevolence of the King and the Nation, who were honored with their distinguished awards, whose deeds were liked by both the King and the People; but the former clergyman Regiment-Holm now deprives them of the reward for the toil of their whole lives - NB without any other evidence against them, than Herr Holm's fantasies about the motives for their course of action. And this may take place in our Fatherland without responsibility before the Law?

Mr. Holm is admittedly such a shabby Author and his work so without any merit that he is not worthy of the respect of an honest man. But the percussion, if it was allowed to survive without reprimand, falls into the hands of a future one generation, who can not imagine the embarrassment and detress of the Kingdom during the period of the years 1808 and 1809, and then the percussionist shall confuse the judgments of our grandsons 'sons and arouse their contempt for the fathers' memories - and this I believe neither we, nor the men who by Mr. Holm attacked, deserved.

But our Commander-in-Chief (Field Marshal Count Klingsporr, Adjutant-General Adlercreutz) did not seem to have any inclination to retake Finland, which at that time had been easy and which is so clearly proved by Sandel's condition. These are the Author's equally remarkable, as degrading, or perhaps merely incomprehensible words.

Not having the desire to take back the Fatherland when it could easily have happened can only be called treason and is nothing or nothing else.

Kastom therefore the eye on the map. Sandels has all the way to Kuopio and Vehmasmäcki, only one way to cover. Thus the retreat cannot be cut off from him, as long as the greater Army is not defeated and completely thrown back. Sandels always had a point of support in this Army. His force was about 2,000 men. He pushed forward in the mohn he realized the possibility of feeding his corps. Where there was a hostile store or magazine, he pushed there. No one can with greater joy than I acknowledge His Excellency the Field Marshal, etc. Count Sandel's merits as Commander; but even he could not make impossibilities, for which reason he too, by the noble Author in his time, may bear the share of the tadlet — accusation of false report.

Were the circumstances the same for Field Marshal Count Klingsporr's Army Corps?

It is true that he could easily have advanced to the Russian military force in the northern part of Ostrobothnia; his corps numbered about 7,000 combatants; but did he have all the necessities for this one? if he could procure the artillery and ammunition with the starving and ridden Artillery and Troop horses, he had the means of transport to procure the necessary subsistence in case such did not exist in the future quarters which at the advance of the Finnish Army and the Russians were mainly taken and which the Russians were probably involved. would be further destroyed when they found that their own well-being depended on it.

Although from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigades until this time no distress had been heard about lack of food during the train, such a thing could still have happened so easily, especially if the shortage had become too great and then the impatient clergyman had has become an attachment to this Armée-Corps.

Already in Old Kokkola, Count Klingsporr was going forced to share his strength if he did not want to run forward as a clergyman.

The further forward Count Klingsporr with his army had penetrated, the more he had been forced to share it, in mohn as the communication channels become more numerous.

In Wasa, Turku and at Hankoudd, larger and smaller Russian Corps stood outside the Count Klingsporr had against him on the battlefield itself. - Count Klingsporr would thus have distanced himself from his certainly anticipated and prepared assets, while the enemy approached his own and the reinforcements he expected that later occurred.

On April 25, the Field Marshal was informed that Admiral Cronstedt at Suomenlinna had capitulated and that the Fortress would be handed over to the enemy on May 3, in case not a certain number of Line Ships as reinforcements before that time had entered the harbor. The Isars were still solid as mountains at this time, and with common sense one could, except Herr Holm, foresee that the Fortress would pass over.

As a result, the siege corps of the Russians against Suomenlinna became available to them, as Count Klingsporr, on the other hand, had no more to expect from this fortress or its garrison. He would thus advance without having had a single point of support in the country, in case his army suffered any defeat, whereby the whole Army, Count Sandels Corps included in it, was jeopardized, contrary to the King's definite instruction.

In May, which was now at hand, the transition from winter to summer took place, which in Finland takes place at great speed. The rivers swell over their banks and the water rushes forward with the speed of the storm. At the same time the Russians also benefited from the great advantages of which the Author at the beginning of his writing makes so much sense, namely the advantageous passes in the cut-through Finland, where the Author claims that a small force can long prevent and sustain superior enemies.

Well, CountKlingsporr here now is considered by the Russians so superior that they could not in the advantageous passes prevent and detain him until necessary reinforcements from their operational base could be issued?

Mr Holm now also claims that the Finnish Army, under enemy fire, would strike bridges over the rushing waters that cut through the country. How would they be compensated for falling? Well, in case Count Klingsporr had been allowed to use all of the Author's, it would have gone well. Eg. if the Army had always received its needs and reinforcements when needed, and had been properly led, then the Army, as the former King claimed, would have driven the Russians out of Europe. But then what would have happened would not have happened, and as the author himself says: that Savolax Hunter at the Lappå affair was forced to quit: voj-voj minum Jalkanin. The author has also wanted to be a breathtaking painter, but has forgotten that without a proper attitude no painting is enough. But when the author tells the aforementioned anecdote, he does not remember what he said here.

On the same page, he goes on to say: " that we have carefully abandoned the country ." That's a shameful untruth. Every time the enemy approached, we defended ourselves as men do and deserve, but we retreated without a knot on the orders of our foremen, we obeyed - such is the duty of the warrior.

That the Author in Kalajocki was allowed to rest and enjoy himself after all his endured field efforts during the ice release, he blames, but expresses dissatisfaction that this was not allowed to happen in Oulu, when the Brigade was needed elsewhere. The author is an above all, and with everything, dissatisfied man.

But what finally became the fate of Field Marshal Count Sandel? Well, to go back - rich in glory, but to no avail to the army - to country and kingdom.

What would have been the fate of the greater Finnish army, if, at Herr Holm's suggestion, it had sprung up without all the calculations and precautions? probably the same as Count Sandels, in case its retreat has not been cut off; but how many accidents — how much suffering was not spared the unfortunate country, by the cessation of such a train? but what does such a service Regiment-Priest have to do with such? only he may blame the General Commander.

Had Suomenlinna still been Swedish and one could certainly count on a reinforcement of 12 to 15,000 men regulating troops and necessary rifles and ammunition for the armament of the Finnish people, then it would have been unforgivable to leave the enemy rest or peace - then one could have left something more ate the hazard. But the whole world, except Herr Holm, knew that the former King wanted to play war, not do it seriously, which is also proven everywhere, when during the Finnish Army's advancing to nearer Tampere, some landings were made with 2 to 3,000 men, who could not advance 3 à 4 miles in the country, not even getting a firm foothold there.

Mr. Holm cites the Spanish Guerrilla War as the blatant success of Napoleon; may he cast his eyes upon the 9,000 Polish and Lithuanian peasants who were blown up by a single Russian regiment.

The priest Holm does not believe that the outcome of the battles depends on the condition of Providence, but he believes that with flat sermons he can defeat enemy armies and conquer lands.

A single occasion seems to have been given, when the Finnish Campaign could probably have taken a different turn than it did now: that was when the first and second Brigades in Hämeenlinna had met.

In honor of the General, etc. Baron of Klerker, and of gratitude for the memory of this brave old man, may I be allowed to quote here an anecdote, which was recently communicated to me by a respectable man, who really had the opportunity to be present when General Klingsporr arrived at Hämeenlinna and the General Baron Klerker received the Command, as well as listening to their first call.

Before the arrival of Count Klingsporr, General af Klerker had already taken all the necessary measures to attack the enemy force the following day, which had pursued us on the way to Hämeenlinna, even a considerable number of horses and sleighs were occupied, so that in the event of a happy exit, throw 2 to 3 Battalions on the way to Helsinki and thus cut off the enemy's refuge and union with the Siege Corps in Suomenlinna.

In and around Hämeenlinna our strength was fully equal, if not greater than that of the enemy. Here the ability of the Finnish warrior would probably have developed all its power. It was about everything that was sacred to us, honor, wife and children. The moral force was here perfectly on our side.

Had General Klerker succeeded in blasting the enemy Corps against Hämeenlinna, which does not seem entirely unbelievable, Suomenlinna would have been saved; part of its garrison was able to support us; the Corps which had advanced on the road to Hankoudd had fallen into our hands without a sword blow, and if from the Russians' base of operations, new forces could not immediately advance, their attack for that year would at least have echoed. But again I am a great warlord with mine om, before which I return to silence.

However, General Klerker must have offered to be responsible for the outcome of the case with his 70-year-old gray head, but to which Count Klingsporr must answer: My instruction is definite, "An order will be issued immediately for the Army's march tomorrow." In this connection, the acting Adjutant General, Count Löfvenhjelm, who was present, allowed himself several throw-ins, but when Count Klingsporr reminded him of Lewenhaupt's fate, all further discussion about it fell through.

The author's reasoning on page 29 is the flattest you can read.

He says e.g. “ And without knowing what you fled for. “The Finnish Army always marched in complete order; it obeyed at all times ordered; it defended itself when the enemy attacked.

Is it called escaping? does this author understand what he is saying?

" But they had once decided to retire, and it was retired with or without reason. ”
