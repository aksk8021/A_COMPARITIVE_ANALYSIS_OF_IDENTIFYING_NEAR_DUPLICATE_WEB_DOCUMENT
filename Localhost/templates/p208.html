The military revolt of January 31, 1891 was characterized by the rashness with which it was decided and the little or no reserve with which it was organized. For months a part of the country had an almost minute knowledge that there was a conspiracy against the monarchy and that important elements recruited from the officialdom of the regiments that garrisoned it entered the conspiracy. However, the patriotic outburst, which in the early hours of the 31st made the green and red flag fly for a few hours, surprised many people because only an insignificant minority did not believe that the explosion of the bomb was out of time .

The single cause of the movement can be traced back to the ultimatum of 1890. For the space of a year, the popular agitation that this diplomatic lash had provoked in the first moments—an agitation that, in the words of João Chagas, had brought to the street for the first time. , to manifest themselves, «serious men with high hats»—for the space of a year, we repeat, this{8}agitation profoundly undermined various social strata and increased in an extraordinary way the discontent of the nation, its hostility against the monarchical regime and the sovereign. It was clearly seen, in that serious moment of the Portuguese life, that, when substituting the ministry which had been overthrown by the ultimatum , the new government had tried, first of all, to shore up the throne, completely disregarding the complaints of the people, their screams thirsty for justice. The homeland was pressed to support the Brigantine monarch in power. The dignity of the nation, its fervent longing that the ultimatumforced government policy to change processes, to work seriously, both were trampled on by the commitment of the monarchy's aulics to prevent it from the progressive march of democratic ideas. Hence the exodus to the republican party of many of the men who had hitherto tried to serve the monarchic parties with good faith and dedication.

Further on, we will develop, as far as possible, this period of contemporary history, whose incidents, we reiterate, gave rise to the thought of the revolt and directly contributed to its breaking out in Porto on January 31, 1891. For now, we will limit our role as a modest and unpretentious chronicler of the Portuguese Revolution describing what happened in Lisbon as soon as the momentary victory of the republican arms was known. It is interesting to recall the hours of deadly anticipation that the capital suffered, while several leagues away a section of brave men was being massacred by the so-called praetorian guard .

 

On the eve of the revolt, the Lisbon newspapers still reflected almost all the indignation and the uproar caused by the ultimatum . a few hours from being{9}Once the movement was initiated, Pontos nos ii inserted a sparkling page by Bordallo Pinheiro, entitled A maldita question ingleza . The persecutions of different army officers followed one another with fierce persistence. On the 30th of January, a newspaper, alluding to the move to the ensign of hunters 9 (quartered in Porto) Simões Trindade, highlighted the curious fact that this officer was, on the 27th of that month, immediately sent to the barracks general of the respective division; then, d'ahi, ordered to proceed, immediately , to the ministry of war; d'here presented immediately at the headquarters of the 1st division, where they had ended up giving him a guide in order to present himself, immediately , too, in the 24th Infantry Regiment, stationed at Pinhel. The Porto newspapers, confirming this persecutory rage, added that the violence of the military authorities was especially focused on inferior officers.

The morning of the 31st came and with it alarming rumors began to circulate in Lisbon. One of them, perhaps the first and the one that acquired the most consistency in the public's mind, said:

 

In Porto, at six o'clock, the regiments of hunters 9 and infantry 10 and part of infantry 18, leaving the barracks, went to the square of Regeneration, cheering the Republic. The movement tends to spread. The municipal guard wanted to oppose him; but, after a discharge given by hunters 9, in which 12 soldiers of that guard died, the others joined the rebels.

 

Then, it was reported that the first military authority in Porto had asked for reinforcements from the guard at dawn.{10} praetorian , but that she had peremptorily refused to fight the revolted troops. It was also said that the entire garrison sided with the insurgents.

These and other news, as is understandable, launched an indescribable agitation in the capital. The first moments were, without a doubt, one of confusion and panic. At 7 am, the ministry had already met and was trying, not without difficulty, to make contact with the situation. At 8 am, the president of the council and General Moreira, commander of the municipal guards, were called to the palace of Ajuda. From one end of the city to the other, the ordinances, the post office, and the population, awakened by the resounding announcement of this coup of republican audacity, curiously watched the sequence and outcome of events.

Shortly after 8 am, it was reported in Lisbon that a telegram received in the newspaper O Seculohe affirmed that all public buildings were occupied by the insurgents and that the population of the northern capital had adhered en masse to the work initiated by the army. It was the complete triumph of the Revolution, the radiant dawn of a new political regime, interrupting in our history the corrosive course of monarchical tyranny. The government, together, tried with successive measures to smother the fire that was raging in Porto. Infantry regiments were ordered to depart there. Mr. Antonio Ennes, minister of the navy, was led to the Arsenal and there, in conference with the general commander of the armada, he demanded that the available warships proceed without delay to invest the revolted city. The ministry trembled with impatience and terror. The royal family constantly inquired about the different phases of the insurrection.{11}optimistic. Joy was drawn on almost every face.

Long hours passed like that—hours of hope, hours of anxious anticipation—during which the rumors never ceased to simmer. The following day, a journalist recounted that the confusion at the moment was such that the same conjurers who spread the news of the decisive victory of the insurgents did not take long to announce the opposite. From early in the morning, there was a huge influx of official characters for the palace of Belém. «From the ministers, a reporter later stated, until the simple gentlemen knights, of whom we saw two, in uniform, go by train to put themselves under the orders of D. Carlos, they all rushed to the royal residence.» The guard of the palace was on that day of infantry 2. But, despite the uproar that went on inside the building, the soldiers were unconcerned and in the place—outside—little was known about the revolution. Politicians, regulars at Arcada, were frantic. Some claimed that the population of Porto, led by officers of hunters 9, had flown the republican flag in the Palácio da Bolsa; others that infantry 8, from Braga, and 14, from Vizeu, had joined the movement; still others that the municipal guard, fraternizing with the rebels, had hastened to release João Chagas, who was then expiating in the Relation jail the condemnation imposed by a crime of the press.bomb pop . From Lisbon, for example, they had asked Porto: How is the patient doing? From Porto they had replied: He must die tomorrow ...

 

But in the early afternoon, optimism gave way to{12}I pass to discouragement. The unofficial agencies began to talk about the suppression of the revolt and the surrender of rebels. It will change the face of things. The palace was animated, the government demanded cold blood. The commander of the military division headquartered in the northern capital—General Scarnichia—who was at the time in Lisbon, dealing with the war ministry for the transfers of his subordinates suspected of republicanism, was leaving at 2:30 for Porto on a special train. A part of the troops that, having received the order to march to the aid of the monarchy, had already gathered at the railway stations, returned to barracks. Guarantees were suspended for one month in the entire district of Porto and the suspension of dangerous newspapers was authorizedthere and in the rest of the country. Evidently, the uprising had not been successful and the bloodshed on the morning of the 31st had only served to record an unsuccessful attempt to react against the oppressive dynasty. Democracy had been defeated shortly after it had won. The atmosphere was once again charged with violence, with a tyrannical yoke, and on the horizon it was already clear that the reprisals were going to be fierce. One of the most popular gazettes of the time, recognizing that, once the sergeant was conquered , the government would undoubtedly hasten to crush the most insignificant velleity of resistance, wrote twenty-four hours after the defeat:

 

«At the mercy of arbitrariness it is difficult to live; let's wait for better days of freedom and... let's shut up."

 

Once the redemptive flash had been extinguished, the press—with rare exceptions—either roared thunderously, angrily, against the rebels, asking the vanquished the maximum punishment—even the death penalty—or{13}she bowed resignedly under the threat of the triumphant, ready to bear in silence the cruel revenge that the victors would openly seek to take from the defeated. The leading nucleus of the republican party wrote a few weeks after the events:

 

«The directory fulfilled its duty, synthesizing the aspirations of a party; instead of appealing to anarchic adventures, he recommended to the republican press, to lecturers and propagandists a calm and justified demonstration of these principles. (Alludia to those who had been consigned in his manifesto of January 11, 1891).

«Accepting the mandate for action, conferred by the last congress, the directory understood that this action consisted in repelling the petty subservience that involved the party in accord with the monarchical groups and in containing the individuals without a mandate, who, working without discipline, compromised the party, as events subsequently proved.

“Revolutions are facts inherent to the social organism; it is not a group of men who make them, as or when they want to; but it is up to that group to give them thought and direction when they come.”

 

In short: the directory understood it to be good policy not to take responsibility for the failed attempt and condemned it for what it felt was disorderly and untimely. In another passage of the document to which we refer, he stated that “the entire nation had immediately judged the movement of January 31 for its inappropriateness .” And yet, within a few days of the revolt, the same directory had spread this clear and vigorous opinion profusely:{14}

 

«At the moment we are going through, there is no room for theoretical demonstrations or for arguing with the pedantocrats of constitutionalism. They have already given their proof. For the extreme crisis, a supreme remedy».

 

Suprema remedio!... What else could it be, after all, if not the one initiated on the morning of the 31st?

 

CHAPTER II
The first rebound of the Anglo-Portuguese diplomatic conflict
We need the facts:

The ultimatum of 11 January 1890 had as its pretext the expedition of Major Serpa Pinto in East Africa. Before that, there was already vague talk about the possibility of an Anglo-Portuguese conflict and because in 1889, at the end of the reign of D. Luiz, everything that depended on the influence or ministerial action was inclined to antagonize—even if more or less less surreptitiously—England and English things.

It seems established that that sovereign, perhaps driven by family considerations, planned to throw himself and ostensibly throw the country into the arms of the German empire, breaking all the intimate ties that, for centuries, united the Portuguese nationality to Great Britain. D. Luiz and his ministers wanted more: they wanted to tie to Germany the destiny of our wine trade and our colonies—the first linked to France and the second related almost all to the English domain. There was even an attempt to make the export of national wines from France to Germany,{15}with the organization in Berlin of a contest, which, in the end, was not productive.

But the first rebuttal of this hostility appeared in an inescapable way in July 1889, when the government then in power rescinded the contract of December 14, 1883 (the contract for the construction of the Lourenço Marques railway). We will by no means say that this termination was only inspired by the desire to hurt the men and interests of Great Britain. The truth, however, is that many people wanted to see in the fact the right opportunity for the transfer of the aforementioned concession to a group of German capitalists and this suspicion emerged clearly and precisely in the press in the most pondered and gentle of terms. England, through the mouth of its journalistic organs, felt deeply affected by the measure taken by the Portuguese government and it didn't take long for it to start a stir to some extent exaggerated,{16}

The London periodicals immediately advised the English government to send a squadron to Lourenço Marques, with the aim, they said ironically, of «protecting its subjects there threatened by the courage of Portugal», and although one or another of these same periodicals vaguely indicated arbitration as a decent means of settling the matter, their ensemble was not out of tune in their demand that we should suffer a significant punishment. For some days it was actually feared that the English government would follow the advice of the exalted press. But, as the time had not yet come for British diplomacy to show us that we were walking the wrong way, intending, in the pacts of international alliance, to replace it with Germany, things were clogged without great expense of dignity and the dark clouds,

The republican party, having followed the course of the incidents with patriotic interest, did not hesitate to publicly stigmatize the maddened project of the monarchy by seeking to entangle nationality in the tangled web of diplomatic conflict. The newspapers of the time speak in detail about the campaign that that party then carried out not only against the projected Luso-Germanic alliance, but mainly against the handing over of the Lourenço Marques railway to a German group.

When the ultimatum came , no one hesitated to recognize that, if the kick of the colossus from beyond La Mancha was brutal, even brutal, the monarchy and its governments nevertheless bore a good part of the blame. João Chagas later expressed an identical opinion when dealing with the matter, in collaboration with former Lieutenant Coelho:

 

«At the beginning of January, we were in a situation{17}chaired by Mr. José Luciano de Castro and in which Mr. Henrique de Barros Gomes, when the newspapers began referring with insistence to the possibility of a conflict with England, regarding the claims of this nation on the territories of Nyassa, where some Portuguese expeditions of a scientific nature operated at the time. The fact seemed new and surprising, even though it had an ancient origin in the plan for the absorption of Southern Africa and the hinterland territories of Mozambique, which began to be carried out in 1888, by the treaty made between England and the Lobengula potentate in which the territory of the Mashonas, claimed by Portugal; and carried out by the treaty of May 18, 1891, extorted by the British government from Portuguese disability.

«The litigation, which came to be disastrously settled by the ultimatum of June 11, 1890, it can be said, began then. For two years—it is necessary to recognize for the clarification of history and ascertainment of responsibilities—England opposed the most formal veto to Portugal's claims . As early as 1887, the Marquis of Salisbury protested against the signed and published treaties between Portugal and Germany and France, declaring that he did not recognize the right, which those nations attributed to us, to exercise jurisdiction in territories of Africa, where we had effective occupation, and he invoked, in order to justify his protest, the decisions of the Berlin conference.

«Later, in 1888, Sir James Fergusson delivered a speech in the Chamber of Commons that made an impression in Portugal, but nevertheless constituted a severe denial, which the British government officially supported, of the sovereign rights invoked by the Portuguese government. , on the backlands of East Africa. When, after the{18}treaty made by England with the Lobengulo ruler, the Portuguese government wanted to define, by a delimitation, the possession of the territories of East Africa (October 1888) the British government, realizing that it would not reach a quick conciliation, made him feel, at Minister in Lisbon, Sir George Petre, that the state of relations between the two governments, with regard to African questions, "was far from satisfactory, and that a prolongation of this state could lead to a serious breach of friendship between the two parents.”

 

In January 1889, the Marquis of Salisbury complained to the Portuguese representative in London that the Portuguese government had sent him to Africa with a mysterious destiny .(to the territories of Nyassa) the expedition of Captain Lieutenant Antonio Maria Cardoso and warned the Portuguese diplomat «that the good relations of the two countries could not long resist the danger to which they were being exposed». This expedition, at the time of the complaint of the Marquis of Salisbury, was encamped on Mount Melange and struggled not only with fevers but also with the lack of porters, some of whom had fled. It is a curious fact: while the English minister was showing the Portuguese representative apprehensions about the main objective of the expedition, «which seemed to him to be the territory occupied by the English missions and commercial stations», the indigenous people of the region crossed by Antonio Maria Cardoso dissolved into complaints against the British subjects, considering them of an exceptional tyranny.

In summary: the British, even before the event that they later invoked as the direct cause of the rupture of relations with our country, were already preparing the coup, taking advantage of all the opportunities to insinuate into Portuguese diplomacy{19}the idea that sooner or later the conflict would erupt and that this would be motivated essentially by our policy and our action in East Africa. The ultimatum of 1890 surprised the Portuguese population to a certain extent. The same did not happen, of course, to the rulers, who were tired of knowing that Great Britain was only waiting for the right moment to send us this humiliating threat.

There are those who attribute criminal intentions to the progressive cabinet minister who most closely dealt with British diplomacy. We believe, however, that this is exaggerated. The minister in question, Mr. Barros Gomes, should perhaps rather be accused of incompetence and ineptitude. Things would naturally have turned out differently if, when England's challenge to the rights that Portugal claimed to have in various East African territories appeared on the screen of the diplomatic discussion, the minister, far from employing delaying procedures, had without loss of time subject the litigation to the examination and decision of a conference of the potential signatories of the General Act of Berlin. On the other hand, as England based its contestation on the fact that these territories had never been occupied{20}logically deny with deeds, and not with words, the arguments used by the mighty Albion.

But the guilty minister felt that he had to maintain an attitude of indecision and pusillanimity until almost before the ultimatum , and so, when the definitive occupation of the contested territories began, with a number of expeditions being launched across Africa, all of them came up against innumerable obstacles that precipitated logically the outcome of the matter. The minister at that time still wanted to amend his hand; it was too late, however, and the diplomatic errors he had committed did not allow for recourse to international arbitration. Portugal had to withstand on a firm footing and without dodging everything that Great Britain brought down on it.

 

CHAPTER III
Serpa Pinto, at the head of 6000 men, defeats the revolted Makololos
The Serpa Pinto expedition, as we have already said, was the fuse that set off the threat contained in the ultimatum . Let us tell you how the case happened:

The expedition had the purpose of affirming the sovereignty of Portugal in the territories of Nyassa, which our country claimed. It was commanded by that army major, and it was made up of several officials and technicians. The lead engineer for the study mission was Mr. Pereira Ferraz. At the end of 1899, Serpa Pinto, leaving Messanje in the direction of Quelimane, gave him the command of the expedition, while another official, Mr. Themudo, headed for Mupasso with part of the people and the boats carrying luggage and supplies. Mr. Pereira Ferraz, accompanied by about two hundred men, went there to find the{21}his mission colleague—willing to camp opposite Mupasso to follow the Commander-in-Chief's instructions to the letter. It was a matter, it is not wrong to repeat, to pacify the region, which some insubordinate blacks «animated by a strange influence, tried to revolt against us».

The effects of this hostile attitude were not long in coming. As soon as the expedition arrived in front of the village of the Makololos, several armed men were seen outside the precincts of the village and "inside, many heads appeared over the palisade, in all perhaps a couple of hundred blacks ready to enter into combat". Mr. Pereira Ferraz signed for a parliamentarian with what appeared to be the chief of the blacks, who responded by signaling him to approach. Mr. Ferraz wanted to tell him that he wasn't going to go to war, so let his people and cargo pass through and that he would give him a gift.

 

“However,” informs the same engineer, “the black man did not let me say anything about that, because as soon as he saw us within range of the flintlock rifles with which he and the others were armed, he shot at us, fleeing into the precinct, so, calling in some of our people, which I can say were no more than 40, we set fire to the village, which they abandoned with the loss of 6 men and about 12 barrels of gunpowder, which exploded in the fire that the landins threw on the village huts ».

 

From here it can be seen that the blacks had the firm intention of attacking the expedition. Shortly afterwards, she was informed that the rulers Massêa, Katanga, Molidima, Caberenguene and the sons of Chipitura had gathered and armed their people and had joined Melaure to beat ours.{22}This terrifying information, it should be noted, was given to the expedition by the English Harry and George Petit, adding that the Melaure had with it a lot of people, a lot of powder and 6,000 rifles. Both of these British agents corresponded with that regulation, and, having Mr. Pereira Ferraz invited both of them, for the greater security of their farms and lives, to retire to the Portuguese village of Natumbe, two days' journey south of Mupasso, placing the necessary vessels at their orders, they replied. who preferred to go to up rather , leaving the very next day towards the north, still trying and unsuccessfully to start panic among the Portuguese auxiliaries.

The Makololos, recovered from the first clash, jumped on the Portuguese village of Samoane and, in our territory, destroyed the collimated road and crossed thorns on it, saying that until there everything belonged to them and that they would kill anyone who dared to collimate a foot of ground. land from there up. The indigenous people of Samoane fled terrified to shelter under the protection of Mr. Pereira Ferraz and this engineer thought it more prudent to put himself on guard and wait for the reinforcements he asked for from the governor of Quelimane.

It was after this that Major Serpa Pinto, adding more people to the expedition and raising his contingent to some 6,000 armed men, marched on the revolted blacks and engaged them in bloody combat in Mupasso. The Makololos left some 72 men dead in the camp and many important prisoners. The expedition set off again after the victory, which, by the way, had an extraordinary resonance abroad. In East Africa and especially in the uprising region the effect was no less. Sultan Macanjira established on the banks of the{23}Nyassa paid allegiance to Portugal. Chief M'ponda also hastened to imitate him; the ruler Malipuiri and another neighbor of the makololos went to{24} Quelimane receive the Portuguese flag. But, while this was happening, the Times , reporting on the fight, made statements on this theory: that Major Serpa Pinto had deceived the English consul in the region where he had fought, affirming peaceful intentions, but that, after some time, he had raised a conflict with the Makololos, carrying out a great slaughter on them and taking from them two British flags recently given by that consul. The Makololos, thinking they had been abandoned by the English, had then recognized Portuguese domination. Major Serpa Pinto, added the Times, announced the intention to conquer the Shire to Lake Nyassa and invited the English residents to place themselves under the protection of Portugal, making them responsible for the consequences in case of refusal. The French press, on the other hand, dealing with the victory achieved by Serpa Pinto, spoke a little more or less in these terms: «the action of the Portuguese major put an end to the comedy that England was playing in Mozambique. We congratulate him on that. Portugal set an excellent example. We hope that other nations will know how to follow him at the opportune occasion to ensure respect for the spheres of influence of each one, and not allow the continual invasions of England in the territory of others».

The information concerning the combat transmitted by the British consul in Zanzibar to the Marquis of Salisbury, who was at the time in Hatfield, was soon reported in the London press with the comment that Lord Salisbury would certainly not proceed with haste until he received details of the fact; that he would first ask Lisbon for an explanation, and, if the Portuguese government did not give it to him, he would call the diplomat mr. Petr. A few days ago, in effect, England's first complaint about the expedition{25}Serpa Pinto. The Marquis of Salisbury addressed a note to the Portuguese government which was delivered to Mr. Barros Gomes by Mr. Glynn Petre, British minister in Lisbon. The note, the London telegrams said on that occasion, took the form of a representation of Portugal's action in South and East Africa and asked our government to repudiate the acts of the Portuguese agent in the Zambezia district. The Marquis of Salisbury, it was claimed, did not use threats; the note contained an exposition of several facts that claimed to have occurred and asked for the restoration of the previous status quoin the region in dispute; the English government could not allow the lowering of the English flag after it had been flown by a responsible representative. Other information said that the note was written in correct terms, although the London office noted, impressed, the news received by Bishop Smythies about hostilities to English establishments by Major Serpa Pinto, events that, after all, did not appear in our father. Serpa Pinto, in fact, objected in Portugal, he had limited himself to clearing the way for the Ferraz expedition, disturbed by the Makololos, and that was all.

This took place on December 18, 1889. The note of the Marquis of Salisbury referring exclusively to the supposed attack of the Portuguese expedition against the Makololos, and making no mention of the other pending matters between England and Portugal on their respective spheres of influence in South and East Africa and asking Mr. Barros Gomes a prompt response, as quickly as possible, and, in case the attack is confirmed, the call to Lisbon of Major Serpa Pinto; the portuguese minister of foreign affairs replied that the information received to date did not confirm the interpretations given{26}by the English Cabinet to the acts of the Major, who 'had only repelled the attack of a hostile tribe in the luggage of which he had found three English flags'. Mr. Barros Gomes ended up asking for a delay in order to communicate with Major Serpa Pinto. Meanwhile, «to be prepared for any contingency», the British government decided to place its naval forces close to Portugal. Persuaded that «the meeting of English warships in the Tagus would unfailingly increase the irritation of the Portuguese and hinder the action of the Portuguese government in its negotiations for the settlement of the question concerning the country of Nyassa», the British battleships were ordered to meet in Gibraltar and from there to remain 'in anticipation of future events'. The ships destined for this enterprise were chosen among those that formed the fleet of the Mediterranean. the battleshipsBendvor and Colossus , on 27 December, were lifting iron
