“We’ll call it quits if you want. I suppose we’ve 33got to hand it to you two.” This last from Siebold.

“Going to call it all off, then? Give us your word! We can’t believe that any fellows in Marshallton Tech would go back on their word.” Bill was smiling genially.

“That can’t be called in question. All off. You’re exempt.” There was a general acquiescence to this. The door slowly and to the seven quite mysteriously swung open; the seven started to file out.

“Good-by, fellows, and no hard feelings. We were only having a little fun with you as you were going to have with us. You can’t——”

“Well, but you two have still got to remember,” said Siebold, shaking his finger at Bill and Gus, “that you are freshies and must keep in your places. You’ve got a little the better of us this time, but——”

“Golly, Dan,” spoke up a fellow hazer, “a little the better? Strikes me we’ve all been good and licked and these chaps ought to get the credit 34for——” The voice died away along the hall and Bill turned to his chum.

“We don’t want any credit, do we, Gus? But we will get it just the same when this gets out. I sort o’ think our little stock has gone up about one thousand percentum, even though we are freshies.”

This proved quite correct. In a few minutes a lot of freshmen had crowded into the room and there was a sprinkling of sophs also. Questioned eagerly, Bill explained quite freely the purpose of the encounter and its result. Whereupon a big, fat soph declared quite vehemently:

“Huh! They were easily licked. No pluck. You’re lucky to have run into a bunch of quitters.”

“You wouldn’t have quit, eh, Jumbo?” ventured another, grinning.

“Huh! Nothing like this contraption—” began the husky fellow, advancing and laying his hand on the top cross wire.35

“Not even for a little thing like this?” queried Bill, reaching the wall button.

“Ow! Blazes! Quit! Don’t! Oh, darn! Stop! Turn—it—off! E-e-e-e-e-! Help!” And the instant the stabbing current ceased, Fatty fell back from it and glared at Bill.

“You really can’t blame them for quitting, can you?” asked Bill, and for answer the husky soph turned and fled from the room, followed by the jeering laughter of the crowd.

And that ended it. After Bill had asked the crowd if any or all of them wanted to test the “convincer,” as he called the electrical rigging, he bade the onlookers who filled the hallway a pleasant au revoir, and Gus again pulled the strings that closed the door.

CHAPTER V
FAME AND FINANCES
Nothing could have taken place to put the lads from Freeport on the pedestal of fame more noticeably than this experiment. They had easily and modestly staged a complete breakdown of the hazing habit at Marshallton Tech. Strangely perhaps there was no blame nor suspicion put upon Bill and Gus for the subsequent edict from the faculty forbidding it. That seemed to be considered a natural aftermath to the news of the electrical reception of the hazers.

The stunt did more than earn the boys a large share of fame. It made them so deservedly popular, even with most of the upper classmen, that they soon counted a good many friends and a considerable number of patrons for radio construction. It is a rather odd fact that methods 37already mastered by those of their own age appeal to boys more than the teachings of their elders. So, although the students were getting, or had got, the theory of radio activity and the practice of wireless fully stuffed into them, they turned often to Bill and Gus for help. There were a number of the well-to-do, even among the seniors, who wanted radio receivers made, or coaching in making their own, and to this Bill and Gus responded out of school hours, with the consent of the president, thus earning a good many dollars.

So as not to interfere in any way with the school-shop program, and not to crowd those lads who were finding the room in the shop and the tools to their advantage, Bill and Gus rented an unused storeroom in the basement of the dormitory. They cleared it out, sent for their own tools at Freeport, purchased others—a foot-power lathe, a jigsaw and a hand wall-drill—and put up some benches. Besides working therein themselves, 38they charged also the modest price of twenty-five cents an hour to others mechanically inclined.

The liberal-minded school faculty found no fault with an arrangement which could only mean a more thorough learning and a finer comradeship among the students. The professors, who often visited and even worked in the little shop—some of them paying their quota also—came to refer familiarly to the place as the “commercial and sales department.”

Professor Grant, the very able teacher of physics, who possessed far more theoretical knowledge than practice, gave the boys many valuable ideas out of class, and got some himself, being also a deadhead. And Search, the manual-training teacher, who knew the use of tools as a bee knows honey, got a few ideas while imparting many, as he also was made welcome to tinker around the boys’ shop.

These were truly strenuous days and weeks for Bill and Gus. They had little studying to do, for 39Bill grasped problems as a trout takes in minnows, and he needed but to coach Gus briefly. The latter spent only a quarter-hour each day in the gym, never indulging in contests, but content to work hard at the things that best kept him fit. He had elected not to put himself under the instructor, grudging the time. But one day when he went over and, with his bare, work-hardened fists, punched a lively rubber bag for several minutes, Professor LeRoy, who had been watching, came to Gus with almost a demand that he join the boxing class in view of the Marshallton Tech entering contests with other schools during the coming winter. But Gus declined.

“No; I haven’t the speed and I am weak with my left, as you may have noticed. Hurt it once on a lathe in my father’s shop; never will be any good for quick work.”

“We will overcome that,” said the instructor, “develop it.”

“Also,” declared the boy, “I have neither the 40time nor the inclination. Must work and nothing much else. But I thank you, Professor.”

“Sorry, my boy; you’ve certainly got a wicked right and you can use the other.”

“I’d want to use both,” asserted Gus, laughing.

As for Bill, the hours each day and all of Saturday spent in the shop sufficed for exercise; the rest was spent in study, brief eating and no more sleep than he needed. And nearly every moment that could be spared found both boys in their shop.

They had under way the construction of five radio receivers of the finer type, for each of which they would get sixty dollars, the materials costing about fifteen dollars. These receivers were equal to more than a thousand miles, with strong, durable batteries and very wide amplification. As with their first radio and the one for their good old friend, Mr. Hooper, they made nearly all the parts themselves, even to the switch arms, contacts, buzzer and binding posts, cutting all threads with a fine set of standard taps and dies.41

They also had two crystal sets to make, for which they charged twenty dollars each, and made a profit of seventeen dollars over the cost of the materials.

The most interesting was the making of four portable sets, with vacuum tube detectors and loop aërials not over six inches in diameter, each packed in small, neatly made wooden cases about the size of an ordinary paper shoe box, the lids when opened forming the upright panels and the loop aërials hinged to open out and upright. Being rather unique in design, and satisfying fads for unusual construction, the boys felt they should get at least fifty dollars for each of these sets, the materials costing about twelve dollars.

Earning enough in this way to help them along very nicely with their schooling, and being more deeply interested in their work than in anything else, it was not surprising that Bill and Gus found little time for play.

When they had finished one of the larger and 42two cheaper sets, that upon installation at fraternity and boarding houses were found to work most satisfactorily, the cash was quickly paid over. Bill divided it equally and handed half to Gus.

“No, you don’t, old fellow!” Gus demurred. “You get this and you can pay me a sort of wages if you want to, or you needn’t. You did all of the planning, the—” He got no further for Bill started in with this indignant tirade:

“You’re a fatheaded, heterogeneous, quadrangular parallelepipedon! What are you trying to get through your topknot, anyway? Don’t we always work together? Isn’t it a partnership?”

“But—er—Bill——”

“‘Butter bill’? Sure. This will pay our bread bill, too, and our entire board bill for some time. And what we’ll get out of these other sets will see us through all of next year nicely, without worrying. Then something will turn up for the third year. Now, then, will you write to Cotton & Staples for that additional wire, or shall I?”43

“I will, of course, but this money——”

“Oh, shut up! If you say another word about it, I’ll lam a battery coil at you—‘b’gorry’—as Mr. Hooper says. Well, now, reckon I’d better turn up and thread some more binding posts.”

44
CHAPTER VI
ANOTHER FELLOW
It was in and over the work of the boys’ shop that Bill and Gus first met the Italian student. Among the upper classmen they had noticed a small, olive-skinned, black-eyed chap, with a rather solemn face, who appeared to be very reticent. It was said that he was a close and a bright student who, though not lacking for money, took little interest in sports, belonging only to the “bruisers,” as the boxing class was called. One afternoon, with Gandy, who was getting a radio set made, the stranger appeared and stood in the doorway, gazing at the busy workers. At first neither of the radio experts saw him. Then he advanced.

“I have the desire very much to make for myself complete a radio getter—ah—what you call? Yes, 45a receiver.” He addressed Gus, who was laying out the hook-up for a crystal set.

“There’s nothing very hard about it,” Gus replied, looking up with his ready smile and scrutinizing the Italian boy.

“You pay the right here, the privilege; is that not so?”

“Yes, we rent the room,” said Gus.

“Ah, so; but I mean—” The newcomer turned partly toward Bill who drew near at the moment and had overheard the question.

“You mean we charge those who work here? Yes, for the use of our tools and machines, but not for any hints and advice we can give. The school shop is at your mercy, too, without charge, as you know.” Bill also sized up his questioner with a certain curiosity and was pleasantly impressed.

“I do not like the school shop. There are so very many con—con—what you call it? Yes, 46conflicting. I should like—prefer—choose to come here, if I may do so.”

“Come along. You keep account of your own time here, and you can pay us when you like. You can get your own materials, or we can get them for you at the prices we pay. We bought up some old pieces of furniture cheap to cut up for bases and cabinets—enough walnut to make a hundred. No charge for it. Help yourself.”

“You are, I wish to say it, veree liber—kind—generous. It is too little that you pay—charge, I mean it. I will ask for your materials and I will commence—begin—start, eh? on to-morrow. Will that be satisfy?”

“Any old time. If we are not here, walk in and go to it. Check your hours up on this pad, see? What is your name?”

“Anthony Sabaste it is. I am called Tony by most. My country it is Italy, but American I now am. My father is of the city—living there. Here, now, I will pay you five dollars on acc——”47

“No, you won’t,” said Bill. “We’d rather have you pay after a while and you can see that the work goes all right. Here, I’ll show you the ropes.”

“Ropes? But I care not to make—build a ship. It is a radio——”

“Oh, sure, I get you; but that’s only slang. You have been here long enough, I should guess from your talk, to get on to our American guff. Well, we’re glad to know you, Mr.——”

“Sabaste, but I best like—I prefer calling me Tony. It means in your language, I get on to it, as fine, grand, fat—no—but swell out—somebody much, eh?”

“It does, sure! I’ll introduce my partner, Augustus Grier; Gus for short, or he’ll get mad. They call me Bill Brown, generally forgetting the Brown, even here at school, where ’most everyone gets his last name. First names are more friendly.”

“I like it, too. In my native it is more mostly 48Signor, even to young—what you call it? Kids, as us, eh?” Tony smiled genially, his face lighting up most agreeably. “Some they call me ‘Wop,’ or ‘Sphagetti’.”

The boys learned that the intelligent young foreigner was in the graduating class which had escaped a lot of practical radio work; that he kept much to himself, either because of a real or fancied notion that social lines might be drawn against him, or because he was naturally unsocial. But after he began the making of a radio set and came in daily contact with Bill and Gus, the young Italian seemed to grow a little out of himself, becoming less reticent and secluded. The good fellowship of two lads a little younger than he, both giving him friendship and confidence, laughing at his errors of speech in perfect good nature and without ridicule, and at their own foibles as well, compelled the Italian boy to like the country of his adoption much better than he had before. This he expressed to Gus:49

“You like me—no, I mean I you like. Yes, that is making to laugh, eh? Funny, very. Well, I mean to say it, you and Bill very much also. Why not? You love the live. You love the study. You make the happiness. You have the great—the large, eh? the big heart. All to you is nice and fine and it is equal to the doing, but you say it, it is worth the while. This makes good-will and kind thoughts to others, also by others—no; from others. You are like one dolce picture in my home. It is by two little birds fabricating their nest and all the time thus they are of song, singing, gay with living and working, helping so much always also to make all the country, this old world happy and satisfy—content. So, to my—to me, you are really it, eh? You are the real thing.”

“If Bill had heard you say all this, Tony, he’d declare you’re both an orator and a poet,” said Gus, laughing.

“And neither am I. But of my country there are many of such, and of learning also, science, 50the great learning. Many large men of the yesterday and many of the to-day also. In this work, too, the first, for is not Marconi——”

“Say that name to Bill and hear him shout some praises.”

“So? And will Bill speak good—noble—high of Signor Marconi? Then I, too, can speak noble of Signor Edison, the American. But what say now if I can tell it to you that my father, he is one sure and big friend of Signor Marconi. Our home, in Italia, what you call—the estate of us, it is not much a great distance from Signor Marconi of his estate. Often I have seen him. And so you understand?”

“By cracky! Radio must have been in the air over there and you caught it!” declared Gus. “Nobody could have it down any more pat than you have. Bill and I have got some dandy ideas from you.”

“That we have,” agreed Bill, thumping in. “What is it now, Gus, that our friend——”51

“Why, Bill, Tony knows Marconi! Just telling me about it.” And Gus went on briefly to repeat that which the Italian had related. Bill, to use a terse but slangy term, proceeded to go up in the air.

“Why, holy cats, Tony, you are from henceforth the cheese! This school has gone wireless mad,—you know that,—and the country is pretty much in the same fix, and for the reason that radio is about the biggest thing in the world. And, fellows, this just fits. We are doing things—everybody is—in radio and now we are going—this school is going—to honor the situation if we can start it that way. For, fellows, Marconi’s yacht, the Elettra, is in New York Harbor, with Marconi on board most of the time. And Tony, we’ll get Doctor Field to let us have a whack at the transmitter and you can talk to your friend, or telegraph your dad and have him come up and radiophone Marconi. And then we’ll listen in 52for his reply, for I’ve read he’s awfully fine and good-natured. Isn’t that so?”

“It is so, sure and indeed!” declared the Italian youth. “I am overenjoyed; you say so, eh? that we shall do this. Let us now go, upon this moment, and talk to the good doctor. There will be no lecturing at this time over the casting abroad——”

“The broadcasting transmitter? No, we can surely get a whack at it.”

53
CHAPTER VII
MESSAGES
Doctor Field, much interested, accompanied the boys to the school broadcasting room, and after determining from some data at hand the wave lengths that would be receivable on the Marconi yacht, Tony began talking earnestly, almost too rapidly, into the horn, the crack and buzzing of the battery charges making a sound like that of a rifle gallery. The president, Bill and Gus also had receiving ’phones clamped to their ears.

“If he doesn’t mind, you might ask him to reply in English, please,” requested the Doctor, and Tony nodded.

And presently a reply did come, though in Italian. Tony got it, at some little length; then with a gesture of disappointment he turned to the others:54

“It is an attend—an assister. He informs me that the wireless wizard, Signor Marconi, whom I explain is a friend to me and my family and he know our name, that the signor is away on the earth—no, on land, you say it,—attends some occasion, or is entertain of American friends and he will not return this many hour. So that it is no value, or you say useless, to cast wide to him again now at this moment and I am, as you say, deject?”

They all laughed and cheered Tony with the assurance that there would be another occasion. Then Bill offered his idea to the president:

“Doctor, we have a notion that this radio business right now ought to have a sort of celebration ’most everywhere; and our school might set the example. Radio is getting to be an awfully big thing, nearly as big as the movies. And now here’s Marconi. Couldn’t we start a general hurrah for radio, bring the apparatus down to the assembly room, have a big concert, send out some 55messages and get Tony here, who knows Marconi, to give us a talk on the inventor of the wireless when he was a boy, and that sort of thing? Of course, if this would interfere with studies, or——”

“It need not, Brown, it need not in the least,” agreed the president. “I like your idea immensely and I foresee some features that we can add. Suppose we fix it for the latter part of this week, handbill it in the town also and make it a gala occasion. It is another way of calling attention to the school and the kind of work we do here. You will all help Professor Grant and the janitor with the mechanical details, which should not take long. And if Sabaste will communicate with Marconi so as to make sure we can get a message from him, that will be the climax.”

The idea proved immensely popular. There are many such plans for calling students together to instil interest in various things that prove “wet blankets” when put into operation, but radio, as 56elsewhere, had taken the school by storm. Separate departments had been organized this year for it. It was equally an interesting plaything and a source of mental gymnastics. It was a matter of curiosity, and not to be interested, was to be out of the swim.

Bill got busy, as hardly ever before in his strenuous career. Because of his uncertain English, Tony balked at giving an address on Marconi, so Bill copied facts and wrote the whole thing out for Tony to memorize, putting in many of the Italian’s phrases, corrected. And getting the Elettra again, Marconi’s former and youthful neighbor was able to make a date for a message from the wireless wizard on the evening of the radio celebration.

That night there was a crowd in the assembly room. Every student was there, half the town, many people from the country around and a few friends of the school from various distances. Doctor Field introduced the occasion briefly. Professor 57Grant gave a talk on the history and rapid growth of radio communication. Professor Judson, assistant in physics, talked on the “little bottles,” as the vacuum tubes are often called. Professor Search talked on the possible future of radio. Then the Doctor arose again and said:

“We want to have members of our student body, also, express to you our interest in this great subject. We are fortunate to have this year a pupil who, though yet a freshman, has shown an unusual grasp of the technicalities of radio. I am going to ask Mr. William Brown to explain briefly some of the methods employed in building, or selecting, a radio receiving set, such as those he has been engaged in making here at the school. His associate, Mr. Augustus Grier, who is an artist, in mechanical matters at least, will aid Mr. Brown at the blackboard.”

Bill laid aside his crutch and hobbled forward to the platform, followed by Gus, whose easy motions were in direct contrast. A round of applause 58greeted the boys. This was increased and a burst of laughter added when Gus took a piece of chalk and with a few quick strokes made what suggested a broadcasting station, with a rooster shouting “cock-a-doodle-doo” into the transmitter. Then he drew a lot of zigzag lines to indicate the Hertzian waves, and at the other end of the board, a hen listening in and registering horror when she hears the sounds translated into “quack, quack.” Meanwhile, Bill had plunged headlong into his subject.

59
CHAPTER VIII
RADIO GALORE
“A good many folks,” said Bill, “get scared when they think about radio construction. The big words come at them all in a bunch like a lot of bees, and it is to dodge. And when they go to the dictionary they are lost for sure. Potentiometer, variometer, variocoupler, radio frequency, amplification, loop aërials, audion and grids—no, I am not saying these words to show off. They are only a part of radio terminology. And you’ve got to get ’em, or you might as well take radio theory and construction on faith and be satisfied simply to listen in.

“Anybody can commit these words to memory without a dictionary, and that’s where my partner shines. He has heard the big words so much that he talks them in his sleep, and he ought to know 60all their meanings, but the one most his size is ‘grid.’”

Here Gus drew a much scared boy, with hair on end and knees knocking together, surrounded by a lot of the words that Bill had pronounced. Then Bill, putting his hand to the side of his mouth and leaning toward his audience as though in confidence, said in a stage whisper:

“He’s doing that to show that he knows how to spell these words.

“To be serious about it, if I’m allowed,” continued Bill, “this subject of radio is a coiner in every way. Just think of someone saying something in San Francisco and someone else in Maine listening to it, and without any speaking tubes, nor wires to carry the sound along! A good many folks are wondering how it happens—how speech can be turned into electricity that goes shooting in all directions and how this is turned back into speech again.

“Well, it’s done on the telephone, over wires. 61The voice in the receiver is turned into electric energy that passes over the wires and at the other end turns again into sounds exactly like the voice that started it. But somebody found out that this same energy could be shot into the air in all directions and carried any distance, maybe as far as the stars, and then when pretty much the same principles were applied to this as to the telephone, with some more apparatus to send and catch the energy, why, then, that was wireless.

“It is really too bad, with all the useless short syllables in our language going to waste, that the fellows who got up the terms for radio work couldn’t have used words like ‘grid,’ for instance. They could have called a variocoupler a ‘gol,’ a potentiometer a ‘dit,’ an induction coil a ‘lim,’ (l-i-m) and a variable condenser would look just as pretty if it were written out as a ‘sos’—but no! They forgot the good example set by the grid, the volt and the ohm and they went and used jawbreakers.62

“I’ll tell you another thing that makes this electro-motive force as used in wireless easier to understand. It is the sun and its light. A great scientist, Doctor Steinmetz, says that light and electric waves are the same thing. Perhaps they are, though they surely work differently under different conditions. But if the sun has an awful lot of heat it can’t send it ninety-five million miles—not in reason! The heat only makes light and that light travels through space. It reaches the atmosphere of our earth and is converted into heat again. Perhaps light of the sun and stars and the reflected light of the planets do not shine through space as light, but as radio waves that either by our atmosphere, or by our electrical conditions here are converted into light again,—but this is hardly open to proof even.”

Bill glanced at the blackboard; Gus had drawn a big sun, with radiating rays, a grinning face, a small body with one short leg and two gesturing hands and had labeled it “Bill Brown, radio radiator.” 63Bill made a motion of his thumb toward the caricature, then spread his hands in mock despair, but not without a side glance expressing pride in his lieutenant’s performance, all of which pleased the audience immensely.

Then Bill proceeded: “This electro-motive force which travels around and through our little earth is what we can actually experiment with. We do not know just what it is, but we are finding out pretty fast what it will do. Perhaps there is hardly any limit to what it will do. It is generated for power and light and heat, for carrying signals and sounds over wires and through the air. What next? Just now we have got all the thinking we can do about radio. It is the sixth wonder that electricity has sprung upon us. I guess we won’t include electrocution.

“Now, there’s no use going into technicalities about construction, that’s a thing that must be studied out and thought over, not mussed up in a talk like this. I’ll say this much, however, it is 64the vacuum or audion tube detector that gives results, and the application of a loud speaker is only possible with a vacuum or audion tube. It is as easy to build a vacuum tube set as a crystal set and only a very little more expensive. So, whether you are building or buying a set, make it a good set, something that you can hear with a good many hundred miles.

“Now, you can buy the parts and build a receiving set that will generally give more satisfaction than a bought set.” (Bill stepped over to the blackboard and took up a pointer.) “I may need this for this partner of mine if he persists in caricaturing me instead of drawing what we want. We’ll make things about four times as big as they ought to be. You can use an aërial outdoors, which everybody now understands, or, just as well and a lot handier, a loop aërial indoors, the bigger the better, but two feet in diameter is big enough.

“Here is your base and upright panel and this is the way to hook up or wire the parts. Here’s 65your aërial and its ground, between which is placed your variable condenser and tuning coil, thus, off here between condenser and coil comes the wire to your vacuum tube, with its fixed condenser and grid leads, the wire being connected directly to the grid, while here the wire from the tube plate is connected with the six-volt storage battery and in turn with the phones, like this. Then, from the phones to the ground wire, the wire is carried thus through a secondary dry cell battery, on each side of which the wires are taken off to a rheostat, though my partner has sketched this to look more like a bird after a caterpillar.

“I am not going to tell you how to make all these parts—if I did you’d probably go to sleep, if you are not half way there already. So, if you can’t find out how to make the parts, or contrive them in some way yourself, why, then, you’d better buy them. Only you can make the base and do the wiring, attaching and so forth. Even my 66partner can do that if he is watched pretty closely; it is almost as easy as making a sketch of it.

“If any of you really want to know how to build a radio set in a practical, get-there way, all you’ll have to do is to get Doctor Field’s consent and come round to our shop in the basement of the school dormitory and we won’t soak you much. I thank you all for your attention.”

Very warm applause indicated the approval of the audience, as Bill and Gus left the platform. Again the president arose to say:

“Another of our students has a message for us in regard to radio. Among the notable pioneers and probably one to give the subject its greatest practical impetus is William Marconi, whose name is familiar to you all. The great inventor is now an honored guest of this country, his yacht Elettra lying off our shores. It seems doubly fitting that more than special mention should be made of him, and as Mr. Antonio Sabaste was, in 67his native land, a neighbor of Marconi, his father being really a friend of the wizard, I think we shall listen with pleasure to what this student of the school has to say.”

68
CHAPTER IX
MARCONI
“My native country,” said Tony, speaking very slowly in an effort to get the construction of his sentences in accordance with Bill’s coaching and as per his written arrangement, “is Italy; my adopted country is America. I say both with pride, and therefore you can imagine with what delight I speak about one of the greatest of Italians and one of the greatest among the scientists of the world, to Americans who perhaps most appreciate and make use of his discoveries.

“Guglielmo Marconi lived not far from Bologna. His father’s estate is called ‘Villa Griffone.’ Not far from these many acres was my former home, and my father, who is a little older than Signor Marconi, knew him well, as well indeed as anyone might know one who was from 69boyhood a rather shy, retiring fellow, with a mind given over largely to mechanical experiments and caring very little for playfellows.

“Signor Marconi, the elder, was proud of his son’s tendencies and gave him mechanical toys when Guglielmo was only a little fellow. His mother was a beautiful English or Irish lady and she also encouraged her son in his tastes. Electricity had a strange fascination for the boy and as he grew older and began to grasp the theories and methods employed in its use he addressed himself more and more to electrical phenomena, never being content with mere performances, but being eager to know the precise methods of application and effect.

“At first Guglielmo had tutors and he led them a merry chase to keep up with his questions. Then, when still young, he was sent to an advanced school in Leghorn, later entering the University at Bologna. But with all that he learned of theory and practice concerning what had become 70his hobby, he obtained more knowledge at home, for his investigations were not along discovered routes, but in new fields.

“When Guglielmo was only sixteen his father had provided him with all the instruments and apparatus he could wish for and he knew no handicaps of this kind.

“In this country a poor boy, without social hindrances, has an equal chance with a rich lad. In my native land, in Europe I think, the lad with means has a better opportunity. Here you have many great men in every walk of life who have been poor, but over there that is a rare thing. Wealth brings opportunity and quick recognition. Guglielmo had this advantage, but if he had not also possessed an earnest, painstaking and brilliant mind he could have gained no distinction. Most of his acquaintances led pleasure-loving, easy, indolent lives and he could have done the same thing. Therefore, what credit is due Guglielmo for the great success he has achieved!71

“While Guglielmo was still in his teens he turned his father’s estate into a vast laboratory and experimenting station. His great success seemed to come from using all outdoors as his workshop.

“In this way he learned the magic of sound waves and vibrations, so that he could send his ‘telegrams’ without a wire. His first experiments were for only a few yards. Then he made the distance longer and longer, little by little, till at the end of five years of constant, persevering trial, with thousands of failures to be sure, he sent an air message two miles.

“Of course, people made fun of him. They thought he was a crank, if not downright crazy and said that his father was very foolish indeed to encourage him in wasting so much time and money in a way that every person with common sense could see was worse than merely simple.

“Guglielmo set his rude transmitting apparatus on a pole on one side of a field and on 72the other side a corresponding pole was set up and connected with a receiving apparatus.

“The young inventor’s interest must have been keen and his hopes high as he sat and watched for the tick of his recording instrument, that he knew should come from the spark sent across the field. Weeks had been spent in the building of these instruments, now to be tested.

“Suddenly the Morse sounder began to record the distant transmission and the boy’s heart gave an exultant bound—the first wireless message had been sent and received.

“Many experiments followed. Varying heights of poles were used and it was found that the distance could be increased in proportion to the altitude of the poles.

“In these first experiments of the young inventor he used practically the same methods that he employs to-day. The transmitting apparatus consisted of electric batteries, an induction coil by which the force of the current is increased, a 73telegrapher’s key to make and break the circuit. Batteries were connected with the induction coil and the telegrapher’s key was placed between the battery and the coil.

“One spark made a single dot, a stream of sparks the dash of the Morse telegraphic code, and with this crude apparatus, sometimes failing to record the signals, Marconi labored with growing faith. He knew he was on the right track and persevered. When he had succeeded in sending a message two miles through the air, Guglielmo determined that it could be two hundred, or two thousand miles, but he chose a shorter distance to prove his theory. He went to the English Channel and before long the world was astounded to learn that this young stranger and experimenter had sent a wireless message over thirty miles. A little later dispatches were sent through the air across the English Channel and received from the Isle of Wight to Land’s End, more than one hundred and eighty miles distant.74

“This youth, twenty-one years old, had succeeded in accomplishing a feat the possibilities of which can hardly yet be conceived. Then Marconi came to London to upbuild and link nation to nation more closely. He was well received in England and began his further work with all the encouragement possible. A series of tests followed that were astounding. Messages were sent through walls, houses, through hill and dale, proving beyond a doubt that the electric waves penetrate everything.

“A few years later, when Marconi was twenty-four, he made wireless reports of the Kingston regatta for evening papers in Dublin, Ireland. This attracted Queen Victoria’s attention at her summer residence at Osborne House, also on the Isle of Wight. At this time the Prince of Wales, who afterward became King Edward the Seventh, was ill on his yacht. This was soon connected with the Queen’s summer ca
