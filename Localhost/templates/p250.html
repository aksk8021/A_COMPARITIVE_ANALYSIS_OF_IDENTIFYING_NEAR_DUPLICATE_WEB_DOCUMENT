§ 1. The manuscript from which the following romance of Sir Torrent of Portugal is taken, is a folio volume on paper, of the fifteenth century, preserved in the Chetham Library at Manchester.

A description of this volume is given by Halliwell in his Account of the European MSS. in the Chetham Library at Manchester, Manchester, 1842, page 16, and by Prof. Koelbing in his Englische Studien, vii. 195. The only edition of this romance that we have hitherto had was done by Halliwell. As he had, besides his own transcript, another copy made by Madden, his text is a pretty accurate one, and therefore the results of Prof. Koelbing’s collation, printed in his Englische Studien, vii. 344 ff., concern, for the most part, things of little importance, except one very curious passage, l. 88, where Halliwell renders the quite correct reading of the MS., p la more de dewe = par l’amour de dieu, by Pericula more bedew[n]e. Also, from l. 1720, the counting of the lines is wrong by 100 lines.

A few short fragments of a printed edition were found by Halliwell in the Douce Collection, Bodleian Library, Oxford, and added to his work as an Appendix. They contain the following passages of the MS.:

vi
Fragment	III. =	 lines	462–489.
„	II. =	„	492–520.
„	VI. =	„	820–851.
„	V. =	„	917–948.
„	IV. =	„	949–970.
„	I. =	„	1807–1866.
A seventh fragment, of which not much more than the rhyming words are preserved, was omitted by Halliwell, and was printed for the first time in Prof. Koelbing’s collation.

This Chetham MS. contains the romance in a very debased and corrupt form, so that the original reading in many passages can hardly be recognized.1 The scribe, who copied the poem from an older MS., lived (no doubt) at a far later period than the poet; he did not therefore understand a great many old expressions, and these he used to supplant by words of his own; he also transposed and even omitted many lines, and spoiled the rhyme, because he had not the slightest idea of the nature of the stanza in which the poem is composed. Halliwell did not trouble himself about the restoration of the true readings; he merely reproduced the traditional text, even where it would have been very easy to do more, though many passages are hopelessly corrupt; still worse is the fact, that he did not recognize the metre as the tail-rhymed twelve-line stanza, for he prints six-line stanzas.

In consequence, the whole of the philological work on the text had still to be done, and a new edition was plainly necessary; the more that this poem, though not written in the best period of romance poetry, treats of a legendary subject widely spread in the Middle Ages, and is nearly related to another poem, Syr Eglamour of Artois.

§ 2. METRE AND VERSIFICATION.
In this and the following section, all line numbers are active links. To reduce visual chaos, link highlighting has been turned off. This may be overridden by your personal browser settings.

As I mentioned before, the romance of Sir Torrent is composed in the well-known tail-rhymed twelve-line stanza, and belongs to that class of it in which the first and the second couplets have different rhyme-sounds (cf. Koelbing, Amis and Amiloun, p. xiv ff.). viiOnly the incompleteness of many stanzas, and the many defects in reference to the rhyme, can excuse Halliwell for not apprehending the character of the metre. As to the structure of the eight lines of the four couplets, each contains (or at least ought to contain) four accents, the caudæ three; but as we, unfortunately, possess only one MS., a conclusive statement on this point is impossible. There is no doubt about the fact that neither the really incorrect rhymes nor the wanting of them can be due to the author of the poem: even when romance poetry was decaying, the poets were fairly perfect rhymers: with all deficiencies in this department, the copyists are to be charged.

Consonant rhymes (s. Schipper Altengl. Metrik, p. 299) are found in Torrent in the following passages: l. 141 rode—rode ags. rôd—râd. 450 the—the ags. þeón—þe. 1558 indede—dede. 2205 lay—lay, sg.—plr. prt.

Identical rhymes are frequent, especially in the caudæ: 81 stond—stond. 177 there—there. 500 he—hee. 1887 there—there. 2538 blithe—blithe. 39 take—take. 342 bold—bold, a. s. o.

Assonances: 195 bon)—Rome. 518 undyrstond—strong. 537 name—alone. 699 yod—fotte. 758 name—tane. 896 bryng—wynd. 1257 overcom)—Aragon). 1768 man)—cam). 2164 anon)—fome. 2544 sithe—hide.

Besides the rhymes we find abundant alliteration, as in most of the Middle English Romances. On alliteration, cf. Regel, Die alliteration in Laȝamon, Germ. Stud. I. 171; F. Lindner, The alliteration in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, Essays on Chaucer, Pt. III., p. 197 ff. Koelbing, Sir Tristrem, p. xxxvii, and Amis and Amiloun, p. lxvi. Lindner as well as Koelbing has adopted Regel’s classification, and so shall I. The most frequent is two alliterative words in one verse; they can be classed in the following way:—

I. A. The same word is repeated in two succeeding lines; v. 456 f.: Forthe sche browght a whyt sted, As whyt as the flowyr in) med; v. 618 f.: In IV quarters he hym drowe, And euery quarter vppon a bowe. v. 2026 f.: But ran into a wildernes Amongist beests that wyld wes. v. 2465 f.: They axid hors and armes bryght, to horsbak went thay in ffere.

viii
B. Alliterative combinations, one part of which is a proper name. Torrent is several times combined with the verb take; 26: Towarde hym he takythe Torrayne; 224: Torrent thether toke the way; 519: Torrent toke a dulful wey; 2269: Whan sir Torent was takyn) than); 91: Now, be my trowthe, seyd Torent than); 1161: Alas, said Desonell̴ the dere; 2523: As was dame Desonell̴; 1906 = 1946 = 1969: Mary myld. To send unto her Sathanas. v. 1091: The castell̴ of Cardon).

II. A. Words of the same root are alliterative. 133: Torrent, on kne knelyd he; 671: That on hys kne he kneld; 2502: And knelid on her kne; 205: Torrent knelyd on hys kne = v. 528; 881: And knelyd vppon ys kne; 1883: She knelid down) vppon) her kne; 2563: Down) they knelid on) her kne; 512: By dymmynge of the day; 1158: For her love did I never no dede; 1801: That ylke dede, that she hath done; 1943: How she flew in a fflight; 2384: Liffe and lyvelode, whill̴ I lyve; 233: A lyon) & a lyonasse; 1671: For to se that selly sight; 407: For the talles thou hast me told; 1466: And fals talis hym) told; 2578: Euer we will̴ be at youre will̴.

B. Relations in which alliterative words stand to each other according to their meaning.

a. Concrete ideas are joined together because they belong to the same sphere of life. 2017: Byrdus and bestis, aye woo ye be; 113: bone and blod; 21: kyng and knyght; 83: And ryche castelles in that contre; 251: In lond with a fyndes fere; 102: That fyndes fare for aye; 1094: Both at knyght and knave; 584: Bothe in) frethe and in feld; 660: Stomlyng thurrow frythe and fen); 1378: Both be hold and be hyll̴; 2398: lym) and lith; 750: Lytyll̴ and mykyll̴, lese and more; 1899: That was lord of all̴ that lond; 2152: Loo, lordys of euery lond; 2375: With all̴ maner of mynstralsye; 149: He reynyd hys sted vnto a stake; 1065: Waytes on the wall̴ gan blowe; 13: water and wynde.

b. In the same way abstract ideas are connected, so far as they belong to the same sphere of life. 460: That dethe ys dynt schalt þou not thole; 1600: Of deth yaue he no dout; 782 = 2062: feyer and fre; 2153: Falshode wyll̴ haue a foule end; 1988: Helpe ixand hold I shall̴ hym yeve; 1492: They sat and song; 683: Cryst hym saue and see; 1303: That he was sad and sore; 1612: set sadly and sore; 335: God that sofryd wonddes sore; 322: styff and strong = 1491 = 2590; 1205: That wekyd was and wight; 1584: wekyd and wight; 1849: Her one child woke and be-gan to wepe; 1559: And wot ye well̴ and not wene; 246: Sche weppte, as sche were wod.

C. The grammatical relations in which the alliterative words stand to each other.

a. Subst. and adj. in attributive or predicative combinations. As bold as eny bore; With browes brod and wyde; 142: hys bugell̴ bold; 307: In a dongon) that ys dym; 82: My fayer) forestes fellythe downe he; 209: The feyer) fyld; 426: glemyrryng ase the glase; 1592: good gate; 171 = 596: the holtes hore; 1484: To an hye hyll̴; 1183: sydes sare; 154: Thowe the wey nevyr so wykkyd were; 2054: wekyd weders; 506: In the wyld-some way; 535: Wyldsom weyes haue I went; 2030: She went on that wilsom) way.

b. Verbs or adjectives combined with the adverb or substantive which contains their secondary adverbial meaning. 1478: To be here at his bane, cf. 1678: That there his bane hath be; 1944: To her birdus was she boun); 2016: With blis on euery bowȝe; 135: That bowght hym with hys blod; 1045: Thurrow the body he gan hym bere; 1404: To the bote they bare; 334: Thus he covyrd owt of care; 27: That dowghtty ys in dedde, cf. 1725; 98: With-owt fere that he schold fare; 603 = 977: Also fast ase he myght fare; 536: With fyndes for to fyght; 802: To fyght with that fyndes fere; 1262: That was grow both grene and gay; 1060 = 2330: Torent be the hond he hent; 270: That meche ys of myght; 713: That meche wase of myght; 24: For God ys most of myght, cf. 1112: To a man off myght; 1879: Vp she rose ageyn) the rough; 2100: Go sech her in) the see; 2129: And sett hym) oute in to the see; 2469: That semely to se were; 126: And symly was to sene; 415: That dare I sothely sey; 1170: Torrent sett on hym) so sore; 139: Serttes, yf I hym slepyng slone; 181: Torrent vndyr hys spryt he sprent; 179: But stond styll̴; 2410: He is so stiff at euery stoure; x987: Torrent in) the storrope stod; 1912: For no stroke wold she stynt; 2060: By a tokyn) I shall̴ the tell̴; 2397: Or walkyd in wede; 383: In hys walke ther ase he went; 725: And went forthe on hys wey; 107: And on hys wey gan he wynd; 2030: She went on that wilsom) way; 989: ale wyld at wyle; 2088: In no wise he wold; 1206: To wed her to my wyffe; 749: That wyt ys vndyr wede; 1315: All̴ men wonderid on that wight; 33: worthyest in wede.

§ 3. THE DIALECT.
The stanza of twelve lines was probably first employed in the north of England; at least it would be difficult to prove the existence xiof a poem composed in this metre in the southern part of the country; therefore it is beforehand probable that the romance of Torrent was composed either in some part of the Midlands or in the North. In order to determine the dialect more precisely, we restrict ourselves to a careful consideration of the rhymes.

1. short vowels.
Old English ă is (1) preserved before n and m: 744 and 788 Iame—name. 927 Adryan—jentylmane. 13 londe—wonande. 352 stond—lygand. 1128 stond—shynand. No part. pres. on-ond rhyming with an unvariable -ond has been traced out until now, but 1824 wepand—wonde (ags. wunden) seems to be the first. 2. Changed into o. 516 rome—frome ags. rûm—fram. 2446 mon)—done. 1190 none—shone—anon—done. 1257 ouercom—Aragon). 1989 son—can (= con). 2040 anon)—bone.

3. the inflexions.

The 3rd person sing. of the present indicative ends in s: 187 tellys—ellys. 2317 rose—gose. 558 tellythe—elles (The rhyme shows that tellys must be inserted; cf. 103 gos—takythe, and 858 gothe—toke = gas—tas.) Only once th occurs: 2047 Nazareth—gethe (ags. gæð). On this remarkable form see Zupitza, Guy of Warwick, note on l. 11075. The plural has no termination: 3 wynde—ende—lende.

Thrice -yng is found: 268 kyng—dwellyng, 1638 and 2568.

The gerund terminates always in ing (yng): 1479 kyng—ryding. 1503 comyng—kyng. 1933 ryng—lettyng. 2509 kyng—lesyng.

xv
The past tense plural of strong verbs has the same vowel as the singular: 1452 They ffound (r. ffand)—goand. 1458 began—gentilman. 1753 tong—dong.

The 3rd pers. of the present indic. of to be = ys or es: cf. 738 blyse—ys. 2413 ys—Raynes. Once ys is found as plural: 2524 ys—iwys.

The past tense singular number is was or wes: 247 alas—wase. 426 glase—was. 771 pase—wase. 1873 wyldernes—was (= wes). The plural were, ware, wore, as well as was, wes: (1) l. 402 wer)—cher. 1047 were—chere. 1845 were—ffere. 2586 squiere—were, here—clere. (2) 603 fare—were. 2494 ware—bare. 1384 beffore—there, were (= wore). (3) 384 pase—wase. 1388 passe—was. (4) 2026 wildernes—was (= wes). 2545 wildernes—was; cf. l. 2584.

The past participle: 7 bedene—ben. 172 byne—seyn. 2344 ibene—kene. 1678 be—crystiaunte.

From this inquiry into the sounds and inflexions, the following conclusions can be drawn:

The development of ă is of no use in fixing the dialect. Nor is ea, which has become a, o, and e, to be deemed a characteristic either of the Midland or Northern dialect. Ags. ea occurs as o as early as 1250 in the Northumbrian Psalter, and 50 years afterwards in Sir Tristrem and Sir Perceval; even Richard Rolle in his Pricke of Conscience offers one instance of this change (cf. Sir Tristrem, p. lxix f.).

The development of the ags. â, which we find in 26 passages as a, in 22 as o, is remarkable. There are only a very few instances of this change in Sir Tristrem, p. lxxi, and in the Psalter; and this almost equal number of a- and o-rhymes proves evidently that the poem cannot belong to a Northern country. At the same time, a proportion xvilike that would be impossible in a text of Southern origin. The same negative result is to be derived from the fact that Ags. y is always written y.

As to the inflexions, the plurals of the substantives are formed by adding -s or -n (en), or by vowel change, or they have no inflexions at all. As for the inflexion -n, it only occurs in slon and shon, and of this very word the plural in n is to be met with even in Northern writers.

The infinitives both preserve or drop the final n, as is the rule with the Midland dialect; the form of the past participle with n accords with the use of the Northern writers.

The present partic. ending in -and and the past tense plurals of strong verbs having adopted the vowel of the singular, agree with the North as well as with the northern districts of the Midland, in the same way as some forms of to be: plr. prs. ys and plr. prt. was, besides the usual forms be and are, resp. were and ware, and the contracted forms of take: 758 name—tane. 1095 gane—itane. 1825 ta—twa (cf. 231, 286, 859, 1333, 1475, 1722, 1733, 2617).

The forms thou has and thou may point to the West.

The inflexions of the 3rd pers. prs. sg. are -th and -s. In the western part of the Midland we never meet with the ending th, but only with s. In Amis and Amiloun, the Eastern origin of which seems to be sure, only the inflexion -eþ is found in the rhyme (Amis, p. xxx ff.).

The romance of Sir Torrent seems to be the first document hitherto considered where both these forms occur, one by the side of the other. Perhaps this fact justifies us in concluding that this poem was composed in the east, but on the borders of the west, Midland.

§ 4. THE CONTENTS OF THE ROMANCE.
Before entering on an inquiry into the sources of the romance, it may be expedient to give a short account of its contents.

In Portugal once reigned a mighty king, whose name was Calamond. He had an only daughter, the fair and gentle Desonelle, who was loved by a young knight called Torrent, son of a Portuguese xviicount. As he could not win her, save by distinguishing himself by valiant exploits, he undertook several adventurous expeditions. First he set out, by the order of the king, against a mischievous and dangerous giant, whom he found lying fast asleep on a hill. He roused the giant by sounding his bugle, and challenged him to fight. Instantly a fierce combat ensued, in which the awkward giant lost his life. In the giant’s castle the young hero delivered a maiden, Eleonore, daughter of the king of Gales, from captivity, and rescued at the same time four princes, whom the giant had taken some time before and imprisoned in an iron cage.

After a short rest Torrent returned into Portugal. He was kindly received by King Calamond, and splendid festivities were celebrated in his honour. The kings of Gales and of Provence showed their gratitude by bestowing on him rich presents, among them a precious sword wrought by Wayland Smith. Desonelle gave him one of her fine palfreys. Calamond, however, shrewd as he was, and envious of the hero’s fame, plotted his ruin. He caused him, by a counterfeit letter of Desonelle, to catch her a falcon in the forest of Maudlen, which was the haunt of a dangerous giant, Rochense, and of many wild beasts. Torrent and his squire set out immediately, but separated on entering the forest, to hunt in the thicket each by himself. Torrent soon encountered a huge dragon, and killed it by vehement strokes. The squire, having meanwhile fallen in with the giant, had been slain by him. The hero, called to the place by the tumult of battle, attacked the giant, and overcame him after a hard struggle. He cut off his head to bear with him as a trophy. He then went into the giant’s castle, where he found a great many jewels, and a bright sword called Mownpolyard. Having returned to the royal court, he ordered five priests to say masses for his squire’s soul. At this very time it happened that the king of Arragon sent messengers to the king of Portugal, in order to bring about a marriage between Desonelle and his youngest son. Calamond would not listen to the advice of his spouse, that he should no longer refuse Desonelle to Torrent, but he promised her to the prince of Arragon, and at the same time sent the hero once more against a giant, Slogus of Foulles in Calabre.

Torrent departed well armed, and after a prosperous voyage arrived in Calabre. There he soon met the giant, who was one-eyed like the Cyclops, and bore a huge cudgel as his only weapon. Torrent threw his spear into the fiend’s eye, and thus overcame him without any long struggle. The king of Calabre graciously welcomed the hero, and largely rewarded him for the service he had rendered his country. Having returned into Portugal, Torrent heard that in a few weeks Desonelle was to be married to the prince of Arragon. Arrayed in knightly dress, he rode right off to Calamond’s court, and challenged his rival to fight. After a short struggle he completely vanquished his antagonist, stretching him on the ground. The next xviiiday, as the king, surrounded by his noble guests, banqueted in the great hall of the castle, Torrent entered with the giant’s head in his hand, and harshly demanded the king’s daughter; he called all the lords to witness of Calamond’s perfidy.

The Emperor of Rome now interceded, and it was agreed at his suggestion that Torrent should fight once more against a giant named Cate; if he vanquished that adversary, he should obtain Desonelle and half Arragon. On an isle near the sea-shore the struggle began in presence of the assembled knights. Torrent struck the club out of the giant’s hand, put him to flight, and killed him as he ran away, casting stones at him. Then the Emperor decided, with the approbation of all his knights, that the hero had won both the land and the maiden.

Torrent obtained Desonelle, and rejoiced in the possession of her, but no solemn marriage was performed.

Twelve weeks after, he left his spouse, impelled by his venturous and ambitious mind; for the king of Norway asked him to fight against a wild giant who had carried off his daughter and was destroying his castles. Torrent bade his mistress farewell, leaving her two golden rings as talismans, and set off with fifty companions. Arrived at the coast of Norway, he and his companions entered a dense forest, in which a great many wild beasts lived. His companions, seized with fear, parted from him, and continued their voyage at sea. They told the king of Norway the false tale that Torrent had perished on shore. The king then set out himself to rescue his daughter. Torrent meanwhile encountered a giant named Weraunt, Cate’s brother, and slew him in a hard struggle, but was himself wounded. In the giant’s castle he saved Gendres, daughter of the Norwegian king, and conducted her to her father. On the road they were met by a large train of gallant knights, and were then convoyed in triumph to the king’s court. There Torrent soon recovered from his wounds, and was amply rewarded with honours and presents. He stayed above twelve months at the Norwegian court. The false companions of Torrent were drowned in the sea by the king’s command, but one squire escaped to Portugal, and reported the tidings that Torrent yet remained in Norway. Soon after, as Desonelle was delivered of twins, the hatred of Calamond suddenly broke out against her. By his order, Desonelle and her two children were put to sea in a small boat; but a favourable wind saved them from ruin, and drove the boat upon the coast of Palestine. As she, helpless, wandered about the downs, a huge dragon (griffin or gripe) appeared, and seized one of her children, and immediately after a wild leopard dragged away the other. With submission she suffered her miserable fate, relying on the help of the Holy Virgin.

The king of Jerusalem, just returning from a voyage, happened to find the leopard with the child, which he ordered to be saved and delivered to him. See
