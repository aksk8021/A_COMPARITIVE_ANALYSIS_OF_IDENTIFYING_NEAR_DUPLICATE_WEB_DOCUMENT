Again the voice of the lieutenant, authoritative and captivating, the voice of a friend who wants to be obeyed:

"Leroy, don't move!" Stay calm. It's an order I give you, my boy. »

And I move on to the results, after the clearing.

I was unharmed, without a scratch. The mattress had protected me by suffocating me a little; it made the heavy weight of earth on my chest less heavy. Besides, the crazy activity of my legs gave me confidence.

Similarly, Cigogne feels nothing of the accident; knocked down, without damage, he then finds himself standing, complete.

Lieutenant Bernaut has a broken arm. He used his other arm a lot to give useful care.

Leroy is suffering from a deep shoulder injury. He too wanted to help with the clearing; the lieutenant had to intervene.

Doris, seated against the back wall of the observatory, her body propped up, her face motionless, very peaceful, her eyes open, her hands resting on her thighs, looks at us. The map he was studying still covers his left knee. He is dead. No doubt: this big hole in the chest…

With a thoughtless gesture, I take off her wool muffler; as if it could bother him! Suddenly, the lower jaw drops. The slight irony of the mouth turns into stupefaction. "Frightful, this astonishment at being dead!" Cigogne and I gently lay Doris on the ground. The face regains its peace.

“Why this one? murmurs Leroy, pointing to the corpse.

"My friend, these are not questions to ask, especially in time of war," the lieutenant said with a small shrug.

I cannot take my eyes off this calm face. I sat down close, to see her better. I bend over her for a long time; so I won't forget it. And, if I took a sketch of it, don't think it was out of curiosity… no! no ! I was only afraid that a detail of the face, even the least, would escape me.

We soon bring a stretcher, only one (we had asked for two), and the lieutenant's horse...

Leroy, who is half unconscious, will be transported immediately; we'll pick up Doris later. We put the lieutenant in the saddle; the bandage I gave him on his arm is very basic and his scarf bothers him. They leave. We remain alone, Cigogne and I, close to the body.

We are frozen, the stove is destroyed; after the explosion, one of the spilled coals burned Doris' left shoe. We stay there, saying nothing, and then, losing all modesty, we start sobbing like children.

“He would have taught me to live! Stork murmurs. Ah! How I envy you, Serval, for keeping a sketch of him! You will be able to see him, follow him, imagine, according to features fixed by you, what he would have become.

- Please, Maxence, do not start your macabre fantasies. Those about Tierspoint were more than enough; Shut up.

- But it's not my fault, he replies, if I miss a comrade who might have become my friend! Your sketch is...

— My sketch represents Doris's face as I saw it; nothing else. I keep a memory, I don't try to compose one. I drew, I did not prophesy. Remember what the lieutenant told you.

- ... And when, suddenly, his mouth opened, do you remember his stunned expression? ... What image had appeared before his green eyes, which astonished him so much? »

The same idea had passed through me.

"The macetary muscles were relaxing: nothing could be simpler," I replied grumpily.

'That's a phrase from a medical student.

- Possibly! »

And we remained there, one and the other, in front of Doris' corpse, both chilled, teeth chattering, teeth chattering louder when a puff brought us additional snow and cold through the entrance window. of the two shells.

Ah! there was not much left of the roof of our observatory, which was so tightly closed!... The telescope, however, had not suffered. Recamped by me on its three precise feet, it insolently occupied the center of an irregular heap of bloody earth and scrap metal under which a corner of a mattress overflowed.

Cigogne shivered and, to warm himself, took a crust of bread from his haversack and ate it.

Doris, lying on the board we called "the dormitory", his chin supported again by this black wool muffler which he tied over his ears, Doris, pinched nose, slightly drawn cheekbones, a sunken yolk, his forehead bare under a short curl of red hair, still suffered. “He seemed to be cold, too.

Really, his skin was taking on strange hues, his hands were indeed the hands of the deceased, just as one imagines them. He had them long and strong, they seemed longer. His eyes were closed, however, he didn't seem to be sleeping: you don't sleep with such a hole in your body. What was the use of covering Doris with her greatcoat, of smothering her under her muffler? We knew too well that by pressing a finger there, in the middle of the chest, it would yield...

A beautiful, noble figure, calm, energetic and sorrowful. Yes, Doris suffered from this icy wind which, in puffs, sprinkled it with fine snow; one would have said that he did not want to let it be seen. That's why he now held his lips tight and his mouth so firmly closed.

I sat down near the corpse to look at it again, the plank of the "dormitory" being wide. — Half an hour passed. — From time to time, Cigogne gazed at that face muffled in black, bloodless and cold, with the cheekbones streaked with red, then he leaned over again, his forehead in his hands, and wept, I think.

Suddenly I remembered a commission the lieutenant had given me and said to Cigogne:

“I'm going to follow the tunnel to the left until the second bend to see if there's any damage. I'll be back in a moment. »

The mud stuck to the feet; under the balaclava, my ears were burning. It did, however, do some good dragging one's breeches painfully through this sticky, icy filth, but I was still cold, cold in my body, cold in my heart, I thought of Doris' cold face.

The shell whose traces I had to look for was buried in the middle of the clay, without damaging the wall of the trench. I returned.

“Come on, Stork! »

Cigogne, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, was crying loudly. He had knelt beside Doris and was shaking hands with the corpse.

“He is so cold! it is already so cold! I want to heat it up! It's so cold, Serval! He misses the warmth of life so much! He is so sorry to be dead!

- Maxence, I said, do not play the fool! stand up !

“Yes, Server. »

He stood in front of me, all trembling, his eyes humble, not saying a word.

I heard voices in the trench.

"Here's the stretcher we're bringing," I said to Cigogne. Give a helping hand. Try to serve something.

“Yes, Server. »

And later, when we got back to the cantonment, I said to him again:

“I saw the lieutenant at the ambulance. He doesn't need anything. Go eat a bite, then go to bed.

“Yes, Server. »

And he went away, his spine bent.CHAPTER XIX
Cigogne spoke to me again of his wife, of Lucienne, of Florimonde, as he sometimes calls her jokingly. He waits impatiently for the letter she must have written to him about his Croix de Guerre and which does not arrive. What will Lucienne say to him? Cigogne is worried about it. Here are new reasons for daydreams all found.

I pass on his subject by singular alternations of indulgence and exasperation. Sometimes I feel that he is suffering sincerely, that he is putting all his strength to suffer, so I pity him, because I remain attached to him, grateful for so many good hours during my sad stay at the depot, but, on the other hand part, how to keep his composure, when at home the showman reveals himself? Aren't his dreams, in short, masks a little better drawn and painted than those of puppets, and much more deceptive? So why does Cigogne retain this freshness of soul that makes everyone love it? We don't usually like the professional actor: his professional flaw is too visible.

I still think I spoke awkwardly of him, I'm afraid you're not interested in his fate. What's the point of describing a being in so much detail if you can't get the reader to cherish that being, when you yourself, deep in your heart, cherish it.

You will say to me: why don't you compose a good portrait of it, with shadows, colors, instead of using the more difficult language of words? And you'll be right again, but my answer is easy: how to hold a pallet in the trench? Besides, I will find at home, classified by my little sister, who enjoys this work, about sixty sketches in which Cigogne appears and which will allow me, I hope, in more peaceful years, to try something else.

Ah! I can see him so well, the poor man, following a bare road, yellow with the sun, his backpack on his shoulder, his legs dusty, looking worried... He does not know how to see the landscape which surrounds him and which would seduce a another, with its olive trees with silver reflections, its hard cliffs and perhaps, over there, a corner of the sea horizon, dark blue. Stork is blind. Does he have a dog to guide him, or is he just smelling the breeze? His dog is his fantasy, a bad dog, an unfaithful pug, and the breeze is sometimes treacherous...

Now he's kicking a pebble, now he's starting to dream. He walks with a more flexible step, the long dusty hours are less painful and less hot. What a marvelous palace he built with this stone! Majestic palace, palace where Stork reigns, where Stork is happy to reign… He smiles, he gets excited… Will that prevent him from twisting his ankle in the first gutter? no, no doubt, and Stork king, Stork who lived such a beautiful, so lofty, so glorious life, falls to the ground, gets up with difficulty, and suffers.

Ah! do not believe that I blame those who distinguish a mermaid's hair in the foaming hollow of the waves and for whom the branches of the forest have divine gestures! these are the happy poets; I envy them. Cigogne is of a completely different essence, Cigogne does not do so, because it is not enough for him to pick up the track of the faun near a spring or along a thick path, he must be this faun, run like he, talking in secret language with his sylvan brothers, raping a surprised nymph, and when Stork, passing his hand over his forehead, does not feel the curve of the twisted horns, he will still suffer.

What do you want ! Cigogne is to be pitied. Why ask him what he cannot offer? He doesn't have those clear eyes that give a sense of perspective in a real world.

"This is far from you, Stork, you cannot reach it: this, on the contrary, is within reach of your fingers... You can follow the path on the right, but this path on the left is cut by a ditch..."

How could he see? how could he hear? Don't judge him too harshly; try to love him a little...

CHAPTER XX
From the lavender notebook.

I do not understand anything ! He must not have received my letter. What does he think of me? However, I took it to the post office myself; a letter in which I had put all my tenderness… It's always those that get lost!… or is it just a simple delay? It has happened before. How worried I am!

Maurice is better. We took him to the hospital here. This boy has every chance. Besides, I'm not his nurse: he's in room 7. I see him often… Soon, he'll be allowed to go out and I hope he'll come and spend Thursday afternoons at home. Alas! he won't make any more music! his arm is getting stiffer and stiffer. Nevertheless, he is not to be pitied: in such a short time, he regains his appetite, the fever disappears, he can walk, he will be able to go for a walk next week.

Mahoudiaux has also kept all his gaiety. He is greatly admired for that, but in all fairness he must consider himself one of the lucky ones in war. - Passed second lieutenant very quickly (he had known the colonel for a long time and had, I believe, done his periods in time of peace) ... yes, but when I think that Roger is still quartermaster! ... Finally!

And then Maurice has a wound which, thanks to the ankylosis, looks like that of a badly injured person and which, whatever people say, must not have caused him so much pain. The cure would have been less rapid, for, in short, he was cured.

Ankylosis of the right arm must bother a lot, the first times. Oh ! certainly, one gets used to it, but, at the beginning… All that is very sad! And then Roger would have had such great pleasure in hearing him play Schumann's Little Carnival !

CHAPTER XXI
A few days ago, at Florimonde's baptism, Cigogne seemed a little ridiculous to me. 'This morning, I must admit, he really bothered me.

Whether it's old letters whose authors are long dead and underground, whether it's oaths, very recent reproaches, a banal note, serious or priceless news, it always displeases me, would I be allowed to , would I even be asked to read a correspondence which is not addressed to me. I would find, in the drawer of an old writing desk bought at the second-hand dealer, a sheaf of yellow and dusty papers, the thread of which I would not dare to untie. I cannot kill in me the feeling that I am committing an indiscretion.

"Read this letter," Stork told me this morning.

- Why ?

— Read this letter, it is ten days old; a ridiculous delay! »

He had read it himself, during the night, under the light of his flashlight. I recognized the grey-purple paper. He read it and reread it. He slept badly and his restlessness kept me awake.

I took the sheet:

"December 29, 1915."

"My darling love",

I stopped.

“Come on, Stork!…

"I tell you to read this letter: you will be doing me a service."

- Very well ! I replied, without hiding my bad mood.

And I read, until the last lines:

“Your wife who loves you. »

“ Lucian.  »

It was not the letter I expected; not at all. The Persian princess, the tender-eyed jerboa, the little ballet magician who, in her black curls, wears a bird-of-paradise feather (stuck there by me), writes very calmly. She must, under her somewhat hectic looks, hide a quiet soul, or so it would be… but that doesn't concern me.

" Well ? I said.

- Well ? he replied.

"I don't like to read letters addressed to anyone other than myself, but since that's done, how can I help you now?" what favor do you ask of me?

'Listen, my old Serval, this letter, so late, worries me. I read it twenty times, during the night! I know it by heart… I don't understand it. »

What does he mean ? The letter is charming.

Mrs. Maxence expresses to her husband the joy she feels at knowing that he has been decorated with the Croix de Guerre for his heroism alone, without being injured . An injury is often the work of chance and, for that very reason, means nothing, whereas Roger really distinguished himself (word underlined). She expected no less of him. The Croix de Guerre must not simply be the price of blood. Maurice Mahoudiaux (one of their close friends, no doubt) was delighted with the news that Mrs. Maxence communicated to him. He asked her to kiss Roger on both cheeks for her and to tell him that he was brave, a hairy man of good breed. Maurice will write himself, but he has to dictate his letters and it is not always easy.

Cigogne interrupts me to tell me that Maurice Mahoudiaux was recently wounded by shrapnel in his right arm and that this arm is stiff. He has now been transported to the hospital where Ms. Maxence is. This Stork knows from other letters; also, that he is better.

I continue. There is, in Madame Maxence's considerations of her husband's military worth, a certain enthusiasm, both sincere and reasonable, which pleases me . In their simplicity, the sentences are warm and say what they mean.

Ms. Maxence then gives various very precise, very tasty household details that Florimonde, as I see her, would certainly not have been able to present in this way . She ends by insistently asking why Roger was nicknamed Stork. Apparently Maurice Mahoudiaux found it funny.

I imagine this young woman, her fingers clenched on her penholder, occasionally shaking her head, ruffling her locks, and applying herself with all her heart to writing wisely, so as not to disturb the heroic Roger.

But how can this letter disturb him, and what service can I render Cigogne?

We have just talked for quite a long time.

Unique boy! — His worry, for he is very worried, boils down to this: Lucienne, when he sees her again, will no longer be the same. Permissions will start soon, we are assured. Cigogne will return home to find an unknown Lucienne there. Did he even know what she was, exactly, before he married her? No… but what does it matter? it is he who has made her what she is (isn't Stork boasting?). Maurice Mahoudiaux is the best of men, a giant with broad shoulders, always cheerful and in a good mood. Soon cured, this ten-year-old friend will resume his habits at Cigogne. Even in the hospital it is probable that he sees Mrs. Maxence very often. So… won't Lucienne be subject to this foreign influence?

"Yes, the best of men, but too much common sense, too much composure!... What would you do in my place?"

He is silent, no, he is still speaking for himself, with closed lips. He must speak passionately: his eyes are more unstable than ever. Sometimes her silent lips move. I answer him in a dry tone:

“In your place, I would parade less nonsense; your wife is not a weather vane. »

He does not listen, then suddenly:

"Today," he said, "Raymond Chert is getting married."

- You were thinking of Raymond Chert! ... I have already given you to understand that this little bastard did not interest me! He must have told you new rubbish: that in his absence the young bitch he was courting had taken another mackerel! that he no longer held it in his hand! how he feared to find her rebellious to his legal love! what else do I know! And you transpose all that thinking of your wife… your wife! wretched ! »

I went a bit far. I fix things with a few friendly words, but still feel angry.

“Besides, I said to him, to conclude, you are, quite simply, jealous! »

First he looks at me stupidly, then he laughs and shakes my hand, then he defends himself briskly, with sincerity, I think. He has boundless confidence in Maurice Mahoudiaux, and as for Lucienne! No, he's happy that his home isn't too lonely, that his wife will soon have such a perfect comrade with her, full of spirit, not noisy… a quiet colossus. — To see her, so small, so slender, next to this legendary giant, ah! it was almost ridiculous! Cigogne recalled with a tender air their beautiful evenings of talks and music (Maurice played the piano very well).

“By the way, now…a stiff arm…”

The image of Mahoudiaux wounded stopped him for a moment, then he resumed:

“Serval, you didn't know that!... And the hours passed without anyone thinking about it, marvelous hours, my friend. Lucienne got up at last and, with a little mocking bow:

“My children, it hasn't been midnight for a long time! »

Cigogne described Mahoudiaux to me, apologizing kindly, like a big kid caught in the act, but who knows that he will always be forgiven.

“I, jealous of Maurice! what an absurd idea! »

So I had nothing more to say.

CHAPTER XXII
Stork speaks:

“When you get back to Paris, Serval, go for a walk in the Jardin des Plantes, if there are still animals there, and consider the monkey cage. This show is a good lesson. They'll chatter, then get used to you. Then make faces at them. They will try to imitate you, to ape you. Those grimaces will be inferior to yours at first, no doubt, but tomorrow… who knows? I imagine these poor beasts dreaming, at night, of more exact contortions, closer to those they admired so much.

“What we do, Serval, is a small thing. Simply, it is necessary to work according to a good example. The work, the action, being temporary, is of little importance, but let's choose the model carefully. A book, a symphony, a painting will die by oblivion, by accident, whereas the image which gave birth to them and which no library, no museum preserves, here below, remains eternally. It will find itself in human brains which will still imitate it and, by a shadow, a new line, will come closer to it by better defining its beauty, in more precise forms. One day, the copy will be perfect, it will blend into the first image… Only then will it live.

“Serval, we always imitate… We want to act, we want to work according to our dream, until the blessed hour when we equal it. Later, the work will serve as an ideal for spiders lurking in their polygons, for marine molluscs, for earthworms in the furrows. Thus, we will help them to think, still obscurely, those who only know desire.

“Yes, we only know how to imitate, like monkeys. We pretend to produce (vanity, pretty coat, hides our antics from ourselves), but, to tell the truth, we are aping. I am not a biologist and these questions leave me cold. I do not know if the man is allied to the monkey by the shape of his jaw or his skull, but it must be admitted that he descends spiritually from him. - So much the better ! here is a perfect ideal for man: to imitate his dream! perfect it!… Move on to another, more beautiful one, if possible!… Seek out a last dream, be seduced by a death that one has chosen, that one has composed for oneself… To die, finally. - Die? Not ! I said: die. To die like this is really to live! »

Stork looks around him at the cold landscape, the hard earth, the leafless woods, the livid sky, as if to beg for approval, but he probably doesn't find what he was looking for. I see Cigogne shivering, confused, trembling… Finally, he is silent.CHAPTER XXIII
From the lavender notebook.

Bad joke!... Is it just a bad joke?

Roger asked me last week to have the "horror" photographed and to send him a chosen print of it. I am very unhappy, very. Here, I can admit it: I suffer from it.

Joke?… How could Roger have afforded it? One does not ridicule what one claims to love; you don't deliberately distort the image you form of someone, even the first comer, and when this someone is dear to you, it becomes a real fault, almost a dishonest action, it seems to me. he.

I hope he doesn't suspect the pain I feel! But do we know what he thinks, over there, in this strange world for which he is so little made, where he struggles perhaps, where he is so unhappy! Ah! my poor Roger!
