I am a state forester on one of the thousands of acres of property in the Highlands of the Treasury, where you can travel by car for a few hours until someone comes out of the woods. I also lived there in the woods, in a lonely townhouse in a deep valley, with two detours and my dog. I’m an unmarried man, one of my polyac bypasses too, but the other has a wife who cooks and washes for all three of us. I only ride into town once a week for shopping because one is reluctant to travel forty miles unless I inevitably have to. The other nearest town, Dobsina, is even further away, more than fifty kilometers away and the road there is three times as tiring as this one.[Pg 8]another. I mention all this only to see how far we live there in the depths of the forests from everything that is called culture and civic life in general.

Perhaps this was the reason that when I was called to join the regiment of which I was a reservist in the twenty-four hours at the outbreak of the war, on the third or fourth of August 1914, I had not felt any resentment, though I knew. that this time it is not a gun exercise but a real and serious campaign. I can’t give myself a reason why, but at first I seemed to feel some satisfaction. It occurred to me that at the same time I would be dropped into people again and instead of an insatiable tree, a pond and polyas peasants, unlike forest wildlife, I would see people, cities, from which I had been united for years. Of course, if I had a family — I wouldn't have taken it that way — but no one had a wife, neither my child nor my parents, who are poor, have been resting for a long time, so such a lonely cuckoo leaves no one here to worry about and no one feels for it. The only creature I regretted leaving to care for my lazy old bypasses was my faithful dog, the Gendarmerie. Well, I even threatened the old lazy to replace him[Pg 9]their skin if I find something wrong with it falling in my dog ​​while I get there.

I didn't even tell them where I was going. An old peasant with such a bony head doesn't care anyway. They are no longer interested in anything but the fox and the wolf — only its skin.

I packed my belongings that day and sat on a horse, in the saddle all night, until the next morning at about eight o'clock I finally got into town and could report to my regiment's barracks.

Sure, I barely knew the once quiet and uninhabited city. It was all like a camp. The many incoming reservists also made the area alive, even the neighborhood. And how cheerful and loud these people were. Almost all of them had flowers next to their hats or hats, and the Hungarian lads in particular stood out with their wild loudness, which resounded throughout the town as if a great wedding was about to take place. At first, I was stunned by the great noise and the urgent vivacity that struck me at the same time. After the eternal silence and peace of the forests, now this noisy noise at the same time — no wonder I was almost dazed until I was able to get used to it somehow.

I was sent from the barracks to say that I would have to wait a few days for the turn to come to us — reservists — because the equipment of the Linea troops would have to be completed.

“How long do I have to wait?” I asked the sergeant.

[Pg 10]

"For three or four days," came the reply.

I wasn't very happy with this news. Going home for these three or four days was no longer worth it, so I decided to stay there. I also got stuck with my horse, but I soon overcame this trouble because I barely took a few steps with it, a captain has already addressed whether this horse is also one of the horses to be initiated? I told you it didn't belong. It belongs to my job, treasury horse.

"I'll make it," the officer said briefly.

He took it and did it very cleverly, at least I took care of it from my neck. I received four hundred forints for it — not in a voucher, but in cash. If they asked for the price, I would have liked to give it for one hundred and fifty. But they didn't ask.

Then not for four days, but for five days I was loitering and lingering, we were just some of the stockpiled reservists, until finally, on the fifth day, the people of the line left the city and we could enter the barracks.

There were so many of us that we could barely fit. And what merriment struck the wide courtyard and the whole lot of buildings. He didn't even hear his own word. Everyone was cheerful and loud. The officers joked with us, the sergeants were gentle, cheerful, ready to serve. There is no trace of the usual rudeness and cruelty of the old barracks. A handsome bearded reservist has declared very seriously that after all these miracles he will inevitably collapse.[Pg 11]the world...

However, the world did not collapse, but we were dressed in its order and manner, and soon all the Rüstungs were released. Everything was delicious, comic and brand new. We were like in the new uniforms, as if we had stretched in a full-fledged “extra” and didn’t come in, but were going home in the extra, let it swell back home when you see Rózsi or Kati’s heart.

My money, which together with the one hundred and twenty forints I brought from home, plus the price of my horse, amounted to five hundred and twenty forints, I skillfully sewn into the inside pocket of my blouse. I made this inside pocket because you don't have a pocket for a regular military blouse. I didn't have to adjust anything anyway, the new pike gray was like a commandment. Well, since I’m a well-grown, big-piece, oil-brown-looking person, it’s not art for me to tailor clothes.

It would have painted very well, although two-threaded astronomical stars on the new blouse, but I didn't even become a corporal at that time, because I was on an eternal war with my sergeant bemem-offspring, and of course I stayed in a private line.

I’ve also seen some beeping scenes, but not much. The crying of a wrinkled, shrunken peasant woman was only particularly striking. There the poor man stood at the gate of his barracks, quietly wiping his tears. Three grandchildren marched in. He was left home alone. It’s no joke if someone is already in their seventies like this old man[Pg 12]aunt. What will this do on its own if there are no good people to comfort you in your desolation and help you in one way or another? I gave the poor five forints of my money. He thanked her, but only continued to cry quietly at the gate of his barracks until evening.

In my century — in the “siegreiche 16th te Kompagnie” —within Captain Morelli, there were only two officers: Lieutenant General Nagy and Lieutenant Schultz. The captain must have been a very old gentleman — he could have been fifty-four or fifty-five years old. He was one of those old-fashioned officers who would never advance above the rank of a centurion — he was stocky, a little brilliant, very noisy, but a kind-hearted and humane soldier — the crew loved him as if he were his father. Lieutenant István Nagy — he was a real giant to the captain — is black as the devil, but also reckless as the devil. He could swear better than a dozen hussars, especially if he played cards and lost. And he was always playing cards and always losing. Lieutenant Schultz was the complete and perfect opposite of everything: an elegant, delicate, blond young man. It was as if he had always stepped out of a perfume box, whether he came or went. The son of man had never seen a single spot on his glove. However, he could. He had the son of a very wealthy Viennese brewer — his money was always plentiful and he gave it out lordly — there was nothing wrong with that. I heard that all the officers of the Bataillon were leaning in on him, to a greater or lesser extent[Pg 13]to his power, which, of course, increased his authority to a tower height, but I did not hear that he had abused that power. He didn't know much in Hungarian.

From the regiment command read out on the afternoon of the ninth day, we learned that we would be wagoned in that evening, leaving the town, and reuniting with the regular troops sent forward.

I couldn’t say there was any extreme urgency-rotation after taking the command, or I saw a head that was too sagging. There were a few of these, too, but not really many. In fact, I could almost say that most of the crew was even happy about it, at least he didn’t have to suffer any more grief from his relatives, which is inevitable at such times.

It was easy for me — no one lamented me and me. But lest I take it dry, the misfortune in the form of a protruding nail into which I stumbled and tore my new boots sideways. I rarely swear, but now I was really very angry at my own awkwardness. Already soon a booty patching the crack. I set out on a cobbler hunt and also found a liverster in the nearby street who was ready to immediately patch the crack — for forty pennies. He patched it up. But he found the skin a little tighter than it should have, so I felt the boots[Pg 14]it certainly squeezes my leg. The liverster encouraged me to “go out” in an hour or two and then he wouldn’t squeeze. This is only at the beginning because the boots are new anyway. However, if you do find a squeeze — bring me back and gladly explain and sew the stain back again.

At seven o'clock in the evening in full Mars-Adjustirung, we stood prepared in the courtyard of the barracks. The colonel rode in front of the front and addressed the crew. He spoke very enthusiastically, but I didn’t understand a word of the whole thing because I was very far from the middle front. Judging from the hurricanes and thunderous roaring after the speech, the colonel was probably able to speak to the taste of the crew.

Then there were commands, we pulled out of the barracks and walked out to the train station. He was haunted by the small and large half of the city. They were inundated with congratulations and immortal flowers. The flower fell even as the infinitely long military train slipped out of the station pretty slowly and kept moving away from the crowd waving, cheering, and even saying goodbye from afar.

*

Except for the menaza breaks, when the train stopped and we were free to get off — we went north uninterrupted for four full days. It is true that we went terribly slow. You don't know what to do with yourself on the second day,[Pg 15]so on the third and fourth! The merry singing ceased on the second day. And many of the lads threw the flower out of the car in their anger the first day. I didn't throw myself out. I was usually much more tolerant of the boring journey than my peers, who were not used to it — like me — to squat in a spot for some cunning forest game for half a day.

Well, that's why I traveled pretty much this terribly slow trip, numbing my legs and hands. And then my boots worried. I felt it squeeze around the slapped spot again. Where I took it off, where I pulled it up again — I tried to expand it — but it didn't work out. So I started making bitter reprimands to myself for not going back to the liverster who offered to unpack and re-sew the stain. After all, my only hope left is that in these dry and warm times of this time, if you don’t let go of the stain, then let go of your mind once your hard morals are soaked and softened anyway.

It was very hot at the time. The overheated air seemed to almost tremble near the parched earth, which just poured the heat out of itself. All the puddles had dried up to the bottom, even the reeds. The cracked clay soil dried up so hard that it could withstand not only infantry, but perhaps even cannons. The cattle cars in which we were transported were real ovens during the day.[Pg 16]It might have exhausted people even more than a four-day trip. They could barely stand. There were those who spoke out loud enough, at the ears of the officers ... but this free speech did not become a problem either. Our Captain Morelli was just as angry as the crew and also frequently referred to »schweinerei«. His parchment-colored, gleaming face almost twitched with angry impatience. The Grand Lieutenant, by the way. What this giant has said out loud is not tolerated by any paperworker. Only the always fine Lieutenant Schultz never said anything that could have stuck to propriety.

But for once, even the longest sermon was over. Our ordeal also ended on the afternoon of the fourth day. We have arrived at our destination — the border, or maybe even beyond.

—Auswaggonirung! Get out people!I can say that I have never preferred to execute an order in my life. I almost flew out of the infamous cattle car like a rubber ball! I have measured the motherland all along, all the way to her! And the others didn’t care about similar trivia. The rapid outward decay that began here! People jumped out of the cars on each other's backs ... falling on their bellies, out of their noses ... but it was out!

We were also done with the menagerie for five o'clock in the afternoon.[Pg 17]We got very good soup, beef and roasted tarragon, every man could eat as much as they could.

Half past six »Vergatterung« was blown.

Cudar was hot, but people didn't care about that now. There was also a small wind, which made the heat as bearable. The main thing was that we didn’t sit in the cattle cars.

The countryside that could be seen was not something beautiful. Barren hills, rolling hills, and far-reaching flat valleys were visible in the distance. Not even the farthest horizon was closed by the mountains. Maybe a man from the Great Plain would have looked at this country with a different eye, but we were a mountain of people, so of course we found him ugly.

At eight o'clock in the evening, the regiment turned into a valley that looked quite deep.

We have already noticed from the round that there is a military camp down there. Tents of gray canvas seemed to face a large area. We noticed a large multitude of weapons loaded in the Gula in the line of the tents, the smoke from the camp kitchens seeping in the direction of the wind, which now cooled the sweat on our foreheads with a slightly more vivid benevolence.

By eye level, I estimated the army camping below for an entire division. I found out later that I was paying well because really our department had been camping here for seven days. We were the last reservists who even[Pg 18]were missing. The division, which was commanded by Baroness Lieutenant General G., was a full-fledged member of the army. The young soldiers knew what the older ones didn't.

We were down halfway through the valley.

We received a very noisy reception as we entered the camp — a cheering and cheering roared at us as if we had already beaten the enemy. I have no idea why I was glad to be here already, but I was glad and would have been much happier if that damn boot stain hadn’t been a commotion on my feet.

As soon as we took our designated place in the camp and put ourselves in a comedy, I immediately took off my boots. I was hoping that maybe the clasp was wrinkled around the spot, but it was squeezing better now than it had been — but the clasp had smoothly surrounded my feet. Again, I just reprimanded myself for not using the master’s offer and believing in the “outing” — now of course it’s too late because I couldn’t get any other boots here. I could have cut the seam, but maybe rain will replace the heat — what am I doing in perforated footwear? The devil take this whole thing.

The heat didn’t let go even after sunset, but we had a very nice starry night.

Everyone except the camp guards slept. I couldn't fall asleep for a long time. Lying on my back, I stared at the starry sky and wandered off,[Pg 19]in thought, home, among my forests. What can my two lazy people do if they don’t have to worry about me being in their heels? Poor good dog! How he could have been looking for me for days until he finally calmed down that we wouldn’t see each other for a while.

Um ... but maybe we'll never see each other again? See, see ... it hasn't occurred to me so far. I haven't really thought for a moment that this possibility is not ruled out ...

Now that I remembered — I felt like it had no effect on me. After all, anyone who has chosen a career like mine needs to be prepared step-by-step to find that someone who has done something wrong will fly a ball into my head sooner than we do in his head, period ... so far and really there is no more. Walking in the depths of the woods, I never knew when and where these bastards might come to me — so I was used to playing with my head on each of my trips. Hence, the thought of death could not have had any particular effect on me.

Judging from the position of the stars, it must have been eleven hours when I finally fell asleep myself.

When I got up in the morning, I was delighted to find that the heat had let in a bit, and what made me even happier was the gracious indulgence of my boots — I could barely feel it when I put it on. Waist thing! She's quite comfortable[Pg 20]I was able to walk in it. Of course, at this moment, I didn’t think the man’s legs were significantly smaller in the morning than during the day when he was already at work.

By five o'clock the whole camp was up. Coffee was brewed in the kitchens, and people saw it washing in a vessel with plenty of water flowing through the camp. The sunny people have ordered that everyone be ready for half a week, as part of the division may be leaving this camp. It was. After about half an hour, there was a lively movement on the right and left wings of the camp, where we were hanging out.

My commander of the century, Captain Morelli, arrived almost running from the battlefield and with an excited face, nevertheless proudly and very pleased to inform his officers and crew that the colonel of the eastern “Vorhut” (protector) of the regiment had assigned our squadron. Also auf.

We were ready in ten minutes. Captain Morelli clung to a saddle and exclaimed in a hoarse, hoarse voice.

—Vorwärts, my sons, live home!

We responded with a roaring edge and headed north-east from the campsite. Meanwhile, I looked back one more time. It occurred to me whether we would ever see those we have now left behind in this frontier valley. I really don't know why it came to my mind right now.

We went uninterrupted until eleven in the morning.[Pg 21]

We also went through a small forest. It was a poor forest, it could have been more of a go-back.

There was no news of the road or its way here. We didn’t even see a beef crash, even though we had already left a good chunk of land behind us. No cattle have been here, no man. Because we didn't see a man. Climbing up a sloping pass, we finally saw a man's footprint in a clearing lined with birch trees. Only the trace and not the man.

It could have been a farm burned to the ground or some other kind of gift that came before our eyes here.

The building was burned to the ground, close to this ash pile, two other ashes were grayed out, perhaps the remnants of pens or cornstacks. The poor trees scorched over this silent place of destruction that could have given no answer to our guesses.

Arriving at the edge of the forest shortly before seven o'clock in the evening — about a thousand steps away — another very ugly sight suddenly caught our eye.

In the middle of the pasture that stretched from here stood a large farm in flames.

Lots of soot-black smoke and a sparkle scorched up in the air. We heard the crackle all the way to the forest, though the distance was a good thousand steps. There are three long color buildings, the dwelling house, the rear huts and sheds, not the[Pg 22]heaps of straw and hay burned. There was a huge amount of black smoke, especially over the piles. For a moment, nothing could be seen, only this thick, sparkled black smoke billowing with wide shocks ... It could be noticed with the naked eye that the beasts running back and forth were caught and driven back by the burning soldiers. behind the farm.After a short wait, we caught a glimpse of Captain Morelli's severely hardened face at the edge of the woods. He stopped under a bush and immediately began sipping the burning homestead. Then he motioned to the officers, and apparently nothing more excited than he used to maneuver, he said:

—Half a damn Cossack. We will attack them.

The rest of the officers know what they are. A general, violent gun crackle began across the line. Elusive! The people — this was their first baptism of fire — became as angry at the sound of their own weapons as if the devil were hiding in them. It was as if the roaring of the rifles and the gunpowder that had easily escaped each of them enraged some ...

They jumped up from the line and rushed to the burning homestead to grab the Cacids who had not yet fled. Because these arson robbers only stood the fire for barely ten minutes, then he fled who knew. There may have been thirty or thirty-five of the fugitives in the wild, lying on the ground scattered, partly dead, partly wounded. People have great accuracy[Pg 23]gal fired, the captain may have been content with the “coaches” he was never happy with anyway. By the time he reached the farm with his aging legs, the crew was ready to disarm the surviving Cossack riders. The dead were gathered and some were laid side by side in the grass so that the captain could examine them as well.

During this work, a terrified little girl and an old woman with a bloody face hid in front of the smoky ruins. The unfortunate sank in front of the captain and in a sobbing voice, in despair, he spoke with a choking cry ... spoke ... spoke ...

We didn’t understand what he was talking about because we were far away from him, but we saw that he was Jewish and now we understood everything.

He was left alone with the unfortunate skinny little girl screaming beside him, the Cossacks killing his entire household, and the corpses thrown into the fire. The captain's bright face blazed with rage.

"The dogs ... the dogs ..." he hissed furiously.

The burning buildings collapsed in the meantime. When the roof of the long earthen house collapsed — a huge cloud of sparks burst into the air and smoke so thick that we all disappeared for a moment or two. People were given a cough stimulus from the stinking smoke and retreated backwards to get fresh air. We were still in it[Pg 24]in the thick smoke, as soon as a shot suddenly fell near the piles that had almost burned to ashes.

Captain Morelli immediately turned and inquired angrily at the name of the donkey who had forgotten a cartridge in his gun. He thought that his "schlampere" had happened, even though it was not once his schlampere. I only arrived there when people reported to the captain in horror that one of the captive Cossack lieutenants, who had been motionless waiting for his fate between two bayonets and who had been forgotten to search — he just pulled a revolver and fired at lightning speed. , where the captain stood. However, the bullet missed a target and struck the back of poor Sergeant Schmidt, who stood with his back to the assassin Cossacks and could not have guessed that he was in danger.

The next moment, the savage killer was already disarmed, but of course that didn't help the poor sergeant. After the shot, he turned around and wanted to say something ... Then he turned pretty quietly around his heels, sat down on the floor and tilted his head forward so that his sipka fell between his flies. Immediately afterwards, the minute they knelt beside the people to help him if possible — a lot of blood blew out of his mouth, his members began to tremble, and the poor sergeant stretched all the way.[Pg 25]on the ground ... By the time the trembling ceased, his mouth opened, his eyes widened and glazed, staring steeply in their cavities ...

He pressed his ear to the chaplain's chest and listened.

"She's not beating anymore ..." he said excitedly.

Captain Morelli also examined his favorite sergeant, but this examination was also a sad one — he had to make sure the duty-witted soldier had suffered.

"She's dead ..." he muttered, his face dark.

Lieutenant Schultz tore his delicate mustache nervously.

"Der arme ... he's done."

The bull-shoulder of the lieutenant general was twitched at that word again. Suddenly he turned to the captain, as if to say something to him, but then said nothing but instead walked over to the defiantly assassinating Cossacks and in a voice whose anger I would never forget, he shouted:

"Poor assassin!" A dishonest soldier like you ...

And the lieutenant's heavy fist fell to the Cossack's head with more force than any steel hammer. The terrible blow hit the Cossacks to the ground, and the enraged people grabbed him, and before the captain's prohibition order was issued — in the blink of an eye, he twisted his arms back to tie him back to the back, as the wolf was accustomed to. However, the Cossacks were a slender and strong man — with tremendous effort[Pg 26]he yanked his twisted right arm out of the grip and slashed so much into the face of Titel Pitelka that there was blood running down his nose and mouth. For the second time, this hairy-bodied muscular beast raised his arm to blow, but with a frantic impulse he caught his fist in the air, stumbling backwards and falling into the gluttony of the pile-ash glowing beside him. A lot of sparks burst into the air, and the hole that fell after the fall was buried again with a glowing mass of ashes ...

The lads were persuaded in vain to be pulled out of the fiery hell.
