The first article in the present number is Chapter IX of the Tripolitan Sketches, by Mr. R. Greenhow, of this city, a series of papers which, of themselves, would have been sufficient to stamp the Messenger with a character of no ordinary kind. The Extracts from My Mexican Journal are excellent papers, on a subject of untiring interest. The Address of Lucian Minor, on Education, is likely to do much good, by attracting the attention of Virginians to the important subject it discusses—the organization of District Schools. The Wissahiccon is a wishy-washy affair, and deserves no praise whatever. Lionel Granby, Chapter VI., is full of fine thought, shrewdness, and originality. The Specimens of Love Letters are curious and entertaining—but the old English Magazines are full of similar articles, and the Messenger should have nothing to do with them. The MS. found in a Bottle is from the pen of Edgar A. Poe. The Critical Notices occupy more than one half of the number, and form the fullest Review in the country—embracing criticisms, at length, of nearly every work lately published in America, besides a great number of English publications. A compendious digest of the principal reviews, English and American, is included. The tone of the criticisms differs widely from puffery, and is perfectly independent.

The Poetry is, for the most part excellent. Scenes from Politian, an unpublished Drama, by Edgar A. Poe, occupy about three pages. A little piece signed Eliza is very good; also, A Sketch, by Alex. Lacey Beard, Marcelia, Ruins, A Sonnet to an infant dying, Lines to Mira, and a Translation. The covers contain compliments of the highest order paid the Messenger by many of the first papers in the Union. Among them we may mention the New York Courier and Enquirer, the Portland Advertiser, the Georgetown Metropolitan, the New England Galaxy, (all of which place the Messenger decidedly at the head of American Magazines,) Norfolk Herald, Richmond Compiler, Baltimore Patriot, Augusta Chronicle, and a host of others. We are truly glad to see these flattering testimonials in behalf of Southern literature. We wish the Messenger every possible success.


From the Pennsylvanian.
The December number of the Southern Literary Messenger has been received. The contributions appear to be of an excellent kind; at least, those from Mr. Poe and others, whose reputations attracted our notice. The most striking feature of the number, however, is the critical department. Eschewing all species of puffery, the Messenger goes to work upon several of the most popular novels of the day, and hacks and hews with a remorselessness and an evident enjoyment of the business, which is as rare as it is amusing, in an indigenous periodical. Of the justice of the criticisms, we have not qualified ourselves to judge; but their severity is manifest enough; and that is such a relief to the dull monotony of praise which rolls smooth in the wake of every new book, that a roughness which savors of honesty and independence is welcome.


From the Globe.
We have read the first number of the second volume of the Southern Literary Messenger. It is highly spoken of, and deservedly so we think. The continued and rapid improvement of this work justifies the zeal with which the proprietor intends prosecuting his labors. They will ultimately be crowned with distinguished success. That region abounds in native talent, which, when diverted into that channel, will reflect the same honor, upon the literature of our country, which it has claimed for the bar, the bench, the legislative halls, and every other pursuit to which it has been devoted.


From the Alexandria Gazette.
Southern Literary Messenger.—The December number, being the first of the second volume of this periodical, has come to hand, and we are prepared to welcome its appearance with cordial approbation.

No Magazine in this country or elsewhere now excels it in the beauty of its typography.—It is printed in the neatest manner, with the handsomest type, on the best paper.

We perceive a considerable improvement in the editorial department, under which are contained several well written and judicious critical notices of new works.

Some of the Poetry in this number is excellent—a few of the articles only so-so.

We recommend the Messenger anew to all our readers, as a publication worthy to be supported for the credit of the South—for its own intrinsic merits and for the enterprising spirit of Mr. White, its worthy proprietor.


From the Norfolk Herald.
Southern Literary Messenger.—The first number of Vol. 2 of this Magazine has come to hand, greatly improved in outward appearance, as well as in literary merit. No Journal of this kind in the country has experienced so rapid, so extensive, and so unequivocal a success as the Southern Literary Messenger. It is now, whether we consider the extent of its patronage, the great beauty of its mechanical appearance, or the lustre of the names of its regular contributors, the first Monthly Magazine in America. In the variety, and more especially in the originality of its articles it has no equal; and among other things we must not forget that the author of the Lunar Hoax is indebted to the Hans Phaal of Mr. Poe (a regular contributor to the Messenger) for the conception and in a great measure for the execution of his discoveries. Indeed several passages in the two are nearly identical. As regards the amount of absolute matter contained in a number of the Messenger, we cannot be far wrong in stating that it is equal to that of any two monthly Journals in the country—with the exception perhaps of Littell's Museum, which is made up altogether of selections from foreign Magazines.

The present No. (No. 1. Vol. 2,) is by far the best yet issued. In the first place we have a continuation of the History and present condition of Tripoli, with some account of the other Barbary Powers. These sketches, from the pen of Robert Greenhow of Washington, have acquired an extensive reputation, and the present chapter is equal to any of the series. By the bye, the last number of Harper's Family Library contains the "History and present condition of the Barbary States," by the Rev. Dr. Russell. Here is surely a great similarity in the titles—more than we can suppose to be accidental. We know that the sketches in the Messenger commenced nine months ago. The Extracts from my Mexican Journal are highly interesting, but would be better were they more modern. The date of the last Extract is 1827. Minor's Address on Education is one of the finest things of the kind we have ever perused, and we should not wonder if it drew public attention to the subject it discusses—the establishment of District Schools throughout Virginia upon a plan similar to that in New England. The Wissahiccon is not very creditable to the Magazine—it might, however be considered as tolerable elsewhere. Lionel Granby is evidently written by a man of genius. The present Chapter is the seventh. The MS. found in a Bottle is extracted from The Gift, Miss Leslie's beautiful Annual. It is from the pen of Edgar A. Poe, "whose eccentric genius," says [p. 136]the Charleston Courier, "delights in the creation of strange possibilities, and in investing the most intangible romances in an air of perfect verisimilitude." We have heard the MS. found in a Bottle, called the best of his Tales—but prefer his Lionizing and Morella.—The highest praise, however, and from the very highest quarters, has been awarded to all he has written. The Specimens of Love Letters in the reign of Edward IV. is an excellent article. The Editorial department, under the modest head of Critical Notices, embraces no less than 56 columns of liberal and well-digested Reviews of new publications. Among these, are Notices of Dr. Bird's last novel—Miss Sedgwick's Linwoods—Glass' Life of Washington—The Edinburgh, London Quarterly, Westminster, and N. American Reviews—The Crayon Miscellany—Godwin's Necromancy—Legends of a Log Cabin—Mrs. Hale's traits of American Life—Hall's Western Sketches—Clinton Bradshaw—and many others—not forgetting Norman Leslie, which is utterly torn to pieces in a long and detailed Review of the most bitter and unsparing sarcasm. These Reviews speak well for the future prosperity of the Messenger. Let its Editor aim at making the Magazine a vehicle for liberal and independent criticisms, and he will not fail to receive a proper encouragement from every lover of literature.

The poetry is very excellent. October by Eliza is beautiful—and also some lines upon the same page by the same writer. Among other things we must particularly mention Marcelia—A Sonnet, and another Sonnet, entitled Ruins, just above it. The Lines on the Blank Leaf—and the Scenes from an unpublished Drama by Edgar A. Poe.


From the Charlottesville Jeffersonian.
The Southern Literary Messenger.—We have been favored by the politeness of Mr. White, with the first number of the second volume of this interesting periodical, and take pleasure in adding our mite to the many well merited praises which his work has already received from other journals; and we agree with Mr. White in his bright anticipations of the future. This periodical must be sustained for the literary credit of the Old Dominion and the honor of the South. Some of our Northern cotemporaries have already declared it the best literary periodical in America, and we deem this praise not so high as when they say it is decidedly good. This number contains sufficient variety to gratify diversity of taste.

The MS. found in a bottle. By Edgar A. Poe, is good,—it is original and well told. Its wild impossibilities are pictured to the imagination with all the detail of circumstances, which truth and the fearful reality might be supposed to present. Whilst we do not agree to the justness of the praise which has been bestowed upon some of Mr. Poe's pieces, we concur in the general commendation which he has received as a writer of great originality, and one who promises well.

The prose article which most pleases us in this number, is Mr. Minor's Address on Education. It is too valuable and upon a subject of too much importance to the State, to be passed with this cursory notice of the Messenger; we shall recur to the subject again and again. We perceive that the Georgetown Metropolitan has censured the Messenger, for publishing Mr. Garnett's Introductory Lecture on the subject of Education, thinking it unsuitable to the Magazine. Mr. White acted properly in disregarding such an objection. Variety is the very life of a literary periodical, and it is never less agreeable for being useful.

There is a pretty thought in the following lines—written on one of the blank leaves of a book sent to a friend in England.

As he who sails afar on southern seas,
Catches rich odor on the evening breeze,
Turns to the shore whence comes the perfumed air,
And knows, though all unseen, some flower is there—
Thus when o'er ocean's wave these pages greet
Thine eye, with many a line from minstrel sweet,
Think of Virginia's clime far off and fair,
And know, though all unseen, a friend is there.—Imogene.
The editorial criticisms are many, and in the right vein. They are caustic but just. The Review of Mr. Fay's novel Norman Leslie, is amusing and will be read, though we think some passages in it are in bad taste. The author is flayed, or to use a term more congenial with his taste, and with the Reviewer's article—blistered.

Halley's Comet—1760. By Miss E. Draper. This poem gives a good account of the great ones of our planet, at the last visit of the messenger of the spheres. The versification too is easy, and the contrasts striking. The same pen has written before, and ought to write again.


From the Washington Telegraph.
The Southern Literary Messenger.—In glancing our eyes over the numerous papers which are daily laid before us, in quest of matter appropriate to our own, they frequently light on notices of this periodical. To such things our peculiar avocations do not often afford us time to attend. We have only indulged our curiosity so far as to see that they are all commendatory; and we have laid aside the papers with nothing more than a passing sense of pleasure at praises which indirectly redound to the honor of the honored home of our fathers. Of late, such notices have so frequently engaged our attention, that we at last determined, for once, to play the truant, and give an attentive perusal to the next number. We have just laid down that for December, 1835, after experiencing a pleasure in the perusal, for which we feel inclined to make such poor return as we can.

In our judgment this number deserves all the praise that has been bestowed upon the work; and this remark we particularly apply to certain "continued" articles, of which we are constrained to judge by the specimens here given. We speak of the "Tripoline Sketches," and "Lionel Granby." If the preceding parts of these works are of equal merit with those before us, they have not been praised too highly. We are sorry that we cannot exactly include the "Mexican Journal" in the same category. It is well enough.

The Address of Mr. Lucian Minor before the Institute of Education of Hampden Sidney College, is a paper of very great merit. We confess that we have not full faith in the efficacy of Mr. M.'s panacea for the distempers of the State; partly because we are afraid the patient cannot be got to take enough of it to do him good; and partly because we are not sure it would not meet with somewhat in his stomach of what medical men call "incompatible substances," which might neutralise or decompose it, or turn it to poison. But we leave these things to the political doctors; and are content to record our praise and thanks for the strong sense and manly frankness displayed by Mr. M. in calling boldly on the people to secure and deserve the blessings of freedom by qualifying themselves for self-government.

The literary notices in this number are highly piquant and amusing. We do not agree with the reviewer in condemning every thing under the name of a "Review," to which that name, in its strictest sense, does not properly apply. He who under this name gives an essay on the subject of the article professed to be reviewed, does not break faith with the public, because, for more than thirty years, the word has been understood to include such essays. Now he who gives a good essay, gives a good thing; and when he does this, still keeping within the spirit and meaning of his engagement, we have no right, nor mind to complain.

There is an occasional severity in some of these strictures which we highly approve. Not that we presume to decide on the justice of the judgments pronounced. We have not read the works; but judgment must be followed by execution; and the critic in his own executioner. The self sufficiency of authors cares nothing for praise. They rarely receive so much as comes up to their own estimate of their merits. To make them value it, they should be put in fear of censure. The number of works reviewed in this monthly periodical, shows how much the cacoethes scribendi needs to be restrained. We dare not flatter ourselves that even half the praise bestowed is due, except according to a very low standard of excellence. When a very high place in the scale is awarded to a "bad imitation" of Walter Scott's "worst manner," the scale cannot be graduated very far above "temperate." There can be no such thing as blood heat, or fever heat, upon it.

The longest of the metrical pieces, indeed, deserves less lenient treatment, and we shall do Mr. White a service, by defending him from the future contributions of one whom he may not choose to offend. We mean the author of "The Dream." In this, there is no one poetical thought, at first, or second hand. The verse is smooth, for the writer has a good ear; but the ideas are dull prose. To make the matter worse, it is a palpable imitation; not larcenous, indeed; for there is no attempt at concealment; so that it is more of the nature of a mere trespass. But it is an undisguised imitation of Byron! and what is worse, of Byron's most wonderful poem "The Dream!!!" It is such an imitation as a boy would make who should paint a rose with pokeberry-juice.

We were disappointed in a "Dramatic Extract" from the pen of Mr. Edgar A. Poe. He had taught us to expect much, for his prose is very often high wrought poetry; but his poetry is prose, not in thought, but in measure. This is a defect of ear alone, which can only be corrected by more study than the thing is worth. As he has a large interest in all the praise that we have bestowed on the Messenger, we hope he will take this slight hint as kindly as it is meant.


From the Richmond Religious Herald.
Southern Literary Messenger.—The publication of the second volume of this work commences with the present number for December. The work was commenced as an experiment to test the practicability of sustaining a literary work in the South. The experiment has been successful. The Messenger has taken a high stand as one of the first literary publications in our country. It has called into existence several gifted pens. It is now established on a permanent basis, and commences its second year with increasing prospects of success, and we hope will yield a fair remuneration to its enterprizing and worthy proprietor. In point of typographical execution it is unequalled by any similar work in the United States.


From the Boon's Lick Democrat.
We have received the Southern Literary Messenger, published monthly at Richmond, [p. 137]Virginia, by Mr. Thomas W. White. It sustains well the high character of its previous numbers—and contains much valuable and entertaining matter. This periodical, the only successful Literary enterprise, we believe, in which southern genius is enlisted, has received showers of applause from all quarters—and indeed it richly merits them all. We recommend those of our friends, who are fond of this species of reading, to try the Messenger—they will find it better—far better than the trash that is circulated in most of the literary periodicals of the day.


From the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post.
The Southern Literary Messenger.—We have been furnished with the December number of this periodical, issued as the first number of the second volume. In typographical appearance it is neat and beautiful, and respecting the interesting character of its contents, it will not suffer by a comparison with any literary publication in the country. The leading original prose articles are, Sketches of the History and Condition of Tripoli, Extracts from my Mexican Journal, An Address on Education, The Wissahiccon, Lionel Granby, &c. The poetic articles are numerous, diversified and highly creditable to the talent of the South; and the editorial criticisms and reviews appear to be written in a spirit of candor quite unusual for the American Press. We commend the whole number to the attention of our literary friends, as possessing unusual interest.


From the Baltimore Atheneum.
The Southern Literary Messenger, for December, which is the first number of the second volume, has already made its appearance. We have scarcely had time to read the title of each article in it, and to glance hastily over one or two of them: but it appears to be not a whit behind the other numbers which we have seen. It is pleasing to observe that the prospects for the permanency and success of this Magazine are very encouraging. The South can, and we are sure will support liberally, both in contributions and subscriptions, a monthly literary periodical, and the Messenger is, in every way, worthy of that patronage. The number before us, and one or two others which we have had the pleasure of seeing, strike us as not containing quite enough of those lighter articles which relieve the mind of the reader, and give a pleasing variety to a work of this kind. The papers are nearly all too good, if we may be allowed to say so, of too sterling and weighty a character. We do not mean that such should be excluded by any means—these are the articles which give character to a Magazine; we only mean that they should be tempered by something lighter and more fanciful.


From the Grand Gulf Advertiser.
Southern Literary Messenger.—We are much gratified to state, that this invaluable Southern publication, is rapidly increasing in the good graces of our literary friends. The Messenger, has a good circulation now, and evinces strong claims for the enlistment of a few more subscribers. We hail the increase as an auspicious event, as it certainly indicates a proportionate exertion of talent and industry on the part of its publisher, to secure the support and approbation of its numerous friends and advocates. Such a work as the Messenger, chaste and refined, pure and exalted in its character, should receive the liberal and unanimous support of every man south of the Potomac. We cheerfully recommend it to all, and it shall be a pleasure to us, to be the means of forwarding its interest. Specimen numbers can be seen at this office, and the work ordered for those who may desire it.


From the Georgetown Metropolitan.
The Southern Literary Messenger for December, 1835.—Many improvements have been made, in this favorite magazine which will greatly enhance its value for the future. Among these, not the least will be the advantage to its subscribers of an early issue: the present number reached us in the latter days of November,—and Maine will be served in future almost as soon as Richmond, a matter of no small consequence to a magazine, and, of great merit in the Messenger, as contrasted with its dilatory cotemporaries.

The present number keeps up the character of the series.

The talent and variety, of the original papers is quite as striking, as the editorial department is decidedly better attended to than in any other magazine of the country. We have not scant notices of two or three volumes, which favor or accident have directed to the editor's notice,—but a comprehensive survey, and analysis of our recent literature.

The books are taken up in a business-like manner, as the cases on a calendar are called over for trial; and the merits or demerits of each are discussed with great ability, fairness, and acumen. A department so well conducted as this, and of such essential utility, should alone, in the general and culpable inattention of our periodicals to it, secure for the Messenger, general support. Of the articles in the present number, the 'Sketches of Tripoli' maintain their value—We should like to see these papers collected in a volume: they really do their author great credit. We won't quarrel with the poetry headed "Mother and Child," because we like the pretty name of Imogene which is signed to it, but it is marvellously like Mrs. Hemans. The Broken Heart is blank verse of great promise, touching, alike, in subject and execution. Rumor assigns them to an accomplished young lady of Richmond, whose name cannot be concealed long from the public.

The "Mexican Journal" is quite as good as such journals usually are; and the unpublished drama by Poe, though crude, has both original thoughts, incidents, and situations.

The Address on Education has in it many forcible truths, correctly and eloquently told. "The Dream" we skip, having already read a better version of it in Lord Byron, and, as we said before, wish cordially that the bottle, with that confounded manuscript, had never been uncorked. "Marcelia" is fine, and the finer Macedoine our readers will recollect in our last. We are always glad to see the full page of payments in the Southern Literary Messenger, and have no doubt but that, under its enterprising and industrious proprietor, it will continue to go on prospering and to prosper.


From the Baltimore American.
We condemned a day or two ago the tone of the notice of the North American Review in the [p. 138]Southern Literary Messenger for December. This number is strong in notices of new works, and we like the severity of some of them: there is much matter for "cutting up." But the cutter up must do his task like a neat carver, without smearing his own fingers. Our friend Mr. White and his editor should keep the tone and bearing of the Messenger elevated and cavalier-like. The higher the critic places himself, the more fatal will be his blows downwards.

This number of the Messenger well supports its rapidly earned reputation. Among its articles may be particularised Mr. Minor's "Address on Education, as connected with the permanence of our Republican Institutions," and the "scenes from Politian, an unpublished Drama" by Edgar A. Poe.


From the Charleston Courier.
The Southern Literary Messenger.—After an interval of several months, a species of literary interdict by the way which we did not much relish, we are able to announce the welcome reception of the December number of this excellent and eminently successful periodical, commencing its second volume and the second year of its bright and promising existence. The State of Virginia has reason to be proud of it, as a valuable exhibition of her mental prowess—it has gathered the stars of her intellectual firmament into close and brilliant constellation, and with their blended light burnished her literary fame. But while collecting into a focus the rays of Southern mind, the Aurora Borealis of genius has been no stranger to its pages, and its intellectual gems have been freely gathered from other portions of the republic of letters. Among its contributors, EDGAR A. POE, equally ripe in graphic humor and various lore, seems by common consent to have been awarded the laurel, and in the number before us fully sustaining the reputation of its predecessors, will be found proofs of his distinguished merit.
