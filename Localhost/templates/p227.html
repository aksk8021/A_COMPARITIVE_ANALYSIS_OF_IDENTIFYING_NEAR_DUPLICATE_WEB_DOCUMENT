The Shrovetide of 1588 was to be celebrated in Salzburg's drinking room with a glittering festival, feast and dance for the bourgeois families, which the young ruler, Archbishop Wolf Dietrich, had promised to attend on behalf of the burgher deputation. Accordingly, everything had to be done to make the festival as glorious as possible in these times; the otherwise sedentary mayor Ludwig Alt took this very important matter into his own hands and approached the city councillors, primarily his brother Wilhelm Alt, the merchant, for strong support, which meant that the pomp-loving prince should be presented with a celebration worthy of him. In the archbishopric everyone knew how well Wolf Dietrich understood such things, his entry in the autumn of last year gave the subjects an idea of ​​this, the unheard-of splendor, which even the merciless Salzburg rain was not able to impair, not only dazzled farmers and burghers, it also amazed the nobility. It was therefore not an easy task to offer a feast to such an art-loving, ostentatious gentleman. But the councilors of the episcopal city had the will to do this, and the rich patricians the necessary money; they want to show the sovereign that the citizens of the capital also know how to throw lavish parties. and the rich patricians the necessary money; they want to show the sovereign that the citizens of the capital also know how to throw lavish parties. and the rich patricians the necessary money; they want to show the sovereign that the citizens of the capital also know how to throw lavish parties.

For many years the council has not been held so zealously as in the period from the New Year to the Mardi Gras festival; the work was shared, each councilor was given his share.

The gaunt merchant Wilhelm Alt, known far and wide for his commercial talents, but even more for his beautiful daughter Salome, who was praised as the most glorious creature in Europe, had taken on the care of the meal and was able to do justice to his task, since he had the help of his daughter in every way competent in housekeeping. Rat Thalhammer, a gentle wine tongue, trained through many journeys in Italy and Greece, took care of the procurement of fine wines; "Father Puchner", the Zäpfler, took it upon himself to fulfill any requests for a drink of good Salzburg beer. Martin Hoss had to get the musicians and give the instructions for the ball.

Other council members ordered the decoration of the premises of the drinking room, which also served as an inn for the accommodation of foreigners and enjoyed great prestige, and finally a special dress code was issued for this festive evening, according to which the male citizenship has to conform, while this is not necessary for the women is, because she already knows how to dress herself up in the most beautiful way.

The dignitaries of the episcopal city had appeared in the drinking-house on foot and often in sedan chairs in the Italian manner, brightly decorated and full of expectation. Salzburg's women and girls gathered in a side room next to the dance hall, the squires and young burghers' sons stood in a group, chatting eagerly, the councilors occupied the front part of the main room, ready to receive and murmuring anxiously in anticipation. Some of the citizens, on the other hand, had quickly discovered that there was a bar in a room behind the ballroom, well stocked with pewter mugs, silver bowls, jugs, goblets and tankards, yes there was also a lot of majolica crockery from Welschland, and the wooden beer bits contrasted quite crudely. Young people soon found out that all these beautiful vessels were partly filled with wine and partly with barley juice. It is true that the commandment says that the bar may not be plundered before the meal begins, but none of the mighty councilors were around today, the waiters were not asked, and so many a person swallowed from the vessels without asking long whether it was allowed and whose content is. "What you have, you own!" roared a young negotiator, and his example was encouraging enough.

In the main hall, so beautiful and grand that a Roman emperor could lodge in it, the table, covered with heavy damask and gold and silver jugs, cups and bowls, was on display, wonderful to look at, also because of the show dishes, there was a peacock with it open wheel, the inevitable pig's head in rich garnish, mighty hucho and red-spotted ferchen, also pheasants with a vertical towering streak, and several mountains of sugar, including the Untersberg, from whose springs white wine trickled down as mountain fountains.

Funny melodies of the cornett blowers and trombonists, along with drum rolls and the tinkling of bells, sounded down from the gallery to shorten the waiting time for the colorfully decorated guests until the beginning, but one did not listen much to the enticing music, which was sometimes softly whirring and then loudly noisy again. The women had better, more important things to do in examining the clothes of their friends, in looking and criticizing, and the sight of Salome Alt, the merchant's beautiful daughter, caused the women present to get excited, which resulted in cries of astonishment, in the murmurs and whispers of grim envy.

Salome, a girl of medium height, barely twenty years old, had just entered the room reserved for women; She greeted the ladies with a smile, nodded to the girls and walked slowly to the mayoress, who could not contain herself at the splendor of such clothing, although she truly knows that Salome has magnificent robes at his disposal thanks to her father's generosity. An enchanting charm is poured out over the round Madonna face of the girl, the slender growth shows the most wonderful symmetry with an abundance of the most charming forms, which a man's eyes must bring to the brightest delight. Dazzling white, the pure forehead, framed by blond curls, the little teeth shimmering like pearls, the golden hair shining in the light of the many candles, children's eyes sweet and pure, round chin, a being so gentle, innocent and alluring, yet modest in nature, avoiding in any way emphasizing one's own beautiful self. A faint red lies on Salome's tender cheeks, a smile of inner triumph on the slightly parted lips. The appearance of the girl must be called princely in the wide blue satin skirt lined with mink fur, trimmed with gold and silver cords, around the neck a chain of four pearls, at the neckline a stiff lace ruff, the sleeves trimmed with a gold-interwoven cloth.

"Greetings, dear aunt!" Salome whispered and
paid due respect to the mayoress.
Frau Alt couldn't open her mouth in surprise and had to catch her breath before she was able to stammer: "Salome! Salome!" You look like a princess! God will punish me embarrassingly if your coat doesn't have five hundred lots of pearls and costs a thousand thalers!"

"Don't you like the dress? That hurts me, the good father is happy and that always makes me happy!

"Certainly too! But pearls, so many pearls for a young damsel! That's too much of a good thing, kid! And pearls will bring tears one day, my grandfather already said that!”

"I'll wait for that, aunt!" laughed the beautiful Salome, "I've got time and I'm not afraid of it. But if you allow me, I want to say hello to the other women!”

While Salome was approaching the women like a princess and yet modestly bourgeois, it was getting louder and louder at the bar over there, where the hastily swallowed strong Südwein was already beginning to unleash the spirits, and both City Councilor Thalhammer and Father Puchner, who was worried about his festival beer, rushed over to to prevent further robberies of the beverage supplies. Her veto and the remark that the delicious wines were intended for the princely entourage, but not for parasites, provoked lively protests from the greedy bourgeois sons, and especially the rather youthful councilor Lechner opposed louder than was proper to sothan mothering. “We are all festival guests and there to drink in the drinking room, it makes no difference whether we drink our allowance before or after the meal.

Now it was the end of Thalhammer's calm, who was offended by a curse on crying, which his tongue recognized as excellent. "He has the plague when these wines are pungent! Drinking water from the Gerhardsberg gives him sanity again, if there was any at all! And I'll send the Rumor servants after him!"

"Just leave them at home! We're in our drinking room, it's municipal and belongs to us citizens! If you want to pray, go into the cathedral, there is enough space for you and the archbishop!”

"Do you want to be quiet right away?" Father Puchner interjected, who did not feel entirely comfortable with such a disrespectful mention of the sovereign who had just been expected. "If you want to bawl, wait for a better opportunity! But not a word more about the enlightened illustrious Lord!”

But the wine devil was already in Lechner's brain and he blustered carelessly: "Enlightened, hehe! The new gentleman with the strange coat of arms! Do you know, beer belly, what the wolf Dieter is up to? I want to tell you: a black ball in a white field! This is the darkness! We will experience it yet, a storm will befall the archbishopric! Get rid of your swollen belly at the right time, the illustrious one could step on you for twining!”

Rat Thalhammer cried out in dismay, "Stop, you're talking your heads off! The new gentleman does not pass a joke from this side and lets us pay what the wine vapor says from you! "

Lechner hissed grimly: "Let your heads dance so that it creates dust, you wimps! I'm not afraid of him, the wolf Dieter and his sword! Haha! A prince of the church strutting about in Spanish like a dandy squire!”

Noisy fanfare interrupted this scene; At a sign from the mayor, the musicians agreed to blow on the sovereign who
had entered the house .

Wolf Dietrich climbed the stairs decorated with fir green and the colors of Salzburg, followed by the dignitaries of his court. The archbishop and sovereign was slender in build, almost small, the features of his face were unattractive, with small but lively eyes whose gaze, however, knew how to gain respect and which no one could endure for long. A restlessness lay over this face, a wealth of ideas, something indefinably powerful, ready at any moment to break loose in a surprising way. Barely thirty years old, this man emanated a will that reminded of the full strength of a mature man, of an indomitable strength of will, the figure of Wolf Dietrich breathed arrogance, despite his small appearance, and in no way reminded of a tolerant prince of the church. Aristocrat from head to toe, Wolf Dietrich combined the qualities of Swabian and Lombard blood; a fresh, young man "quick in mind and spirit and also high in spirit", who, as a result of his studies in the collegium Germanicum in Rome, his upbringing in the palace of his uncle Marx Dietrich von Hohenems, as the grandnephew of the reigning Pope, towered above the country nobility in terms of education and spoke six languages.

Wolf Dietrich wore Spanish costume, the plumed hat that Rudolf II loved, the rappier always at his side when he didn't need the surplice and beret, and a costly black cloak thrown over his shoulders. The Swabian country squire von Raittenau on Lake Constance was certainly not recognizable in this clothing, and Herr von Raittenau, who was elected prince-archbishop of the Salzburg monastery at the age of 29, did not like being reminded of his Swabian origins, although his father's wartime deeds did Hans Werner was glorious enough. His mother Helena was a niece of Pius IV from the Hohenems family, her Medicaean blood surged hot and stormy in Wolf Dietrich in Rome as it did in Salzburg—perceptible everywhere.

Wolf Dietrich scrutinized the decorations in the stairwell with his characteristic piercing stare and slowly climbed up, stopping in front of Mayor Alt, who bowed deeply and respectfully greeted His High Princely Grace without raising his arched back, and the welcome at the same time as the thanks for the gracious appearance of the gracious prince stammered.

A haughty look flew over the mayor's back to the hall doors, through which bright candlelight streamed out, it seemed as if Wolf Dietrich's eyes were looking for a certain embarrassment.

"So like Ew. High princely graces deign to take the step into the home of the announced city, which is trembling with joy, and which is fortunate...."

"Don't hope! Don't love 'trembling' houses! But if I'm to set foot in the hall, He may give space for it!” said the young prince with an ironic smile, whereupon the mayor, startled, pressed his well-fed tummy against the wall of the stairs. Wolf Dietrich walked past him, and Alt was just about to follow the prince when the chamberlain's energetic hand pushed him away, the prince's entourage stayed on the prince's heels. By the time the noble boys had finally climbed the stairs, Wolf Dietrich had long since arrived in the main hall, and the mayor was standing by the wall of the stairs, puzzled.

The city councilors bowed down like a field of corn in the wind in front of the master, whose fiery eyes meanwhile squinted at the women's room, and Wolf Dietrich spoke with surprising and winning kindness: "Thank you all for the friendly welcome! But please, ladies first! I don't want to be the cause of delay, and women should never be kept waiting!"

At a sign from the prince, the chamberlain went to the open door of the
women's waiting room and said: "His high princely graces
ask the ladies to come into the great hall!"
Shy and yet curious, flattered and yet timid at the same time, none of the women wanted to step forward, and it was not at all proper for the young girls to step forward.

"Not around the world and Gastein, I'm leading the way!" whispered the baffled mayoress in an almost insurmountable shyness in front of Wolf Dietrich's eye. But in order to have some share of the honor of coming first, so that the honor of the relatives would remain, Frau Alt gave Salome's niece a friendly and understandable shove with her bony fist and whispered: "You go ahead, your dress makes up for it it!""If you think, Aunt, I'm not afraid and I don't see any reason to be afraid or worried!" said the beautiful Salome softly, and walked through the open door into the main hall; Behind them the wives and daughters wriggled and looked at the young prince in the Spanish costume, their eyes and throats sore.

Even before Salome opened her lips to express the thanks of Salzburg's ladies for the gracious appearance of the sovereign, Wolf Dietrich had approached the beautiful young lady in his impulsive manner, and the prince called out animatedly: "Ah, what happiness smiles at me, the festival Queen appears, and she also wants to accept my homage!” With an elegant twist, Wolf Dietrich grabbed Salome's dainty hand and gallantly pressed his lips to it.

"Your Majesty!" stammered the beautiful Salome in surprise and wanted to withdraw her hand.

"Not at all, bellissima! Grant the mercy that the Salzburg monastery pays homage to the lord of beauty! Your arm, Donna, and now we deign to open the feast!'

Salome had composed herself, the chevaleresque homage flattered her senses, as did the obvious distinction; Salome knew that she was radiantly beautiful, more desirable than any other lady among Salzburg's girls, and in this triumph the young lady, smiling sweetly, laid her full, round arm in that of the young prince. The couple now strode through the hall, the musicians played a brisk tune, the surprised patricians and their wives, sons and daughters did the wisest thing by joining in pairs and walking behind them in a circle. There was plenty of opportunity to chat, the ladies' mouths purred like spinning wheels. The new gentleman brings enough new things into all circles. To open a party without a previous cercle, to fish out a lady, and to elect and proclaim that as the festival queen, what a new, unusual procedure! If only the prince had fished out his own daughter! But so slim Salome Alt, who behaves as if she came from princely blood! She must be jealous that she is beautiful, prettier than everyone else, but because that is an undeniable fact, it would be better if the old daughter stayed more in the background! And this fabulous luxury in clothes! A princess hardly has to wear that many pearls! but as that is an undeniable fact, it would be better if the eldest daughter kept more in the background! And this fabulous luxury in clothes! A princess hardly has to wear that many pearls! but as that is an undeniable fact, it would be better if the eldest daughter kept more in the background! And this fabulous luxury in clothes! A princess hardly has to wear that many pearls!

Salome's father, Herr Wilhelm Alt, was not quite at one with himself as he walked along with his sister-in-law, Salome's aunt. The award bestowed on his daughter certainly flattered her father in part, especially since Wolf Dietrich's manner is otherwise arrogant and the young ruler attaches great importance to courtly forms. But the sudden breach of etiquette does not please the proud merchant, it offends by its extraordinary nature. The scene well observed by Wilhelm Alt, how the mayor's brother was pressed against the wall of the staircase by the gentlemen of the princely entourage, also looks like a thorn; the courtiers take it upon themselves in their high spirits, civic pride is hurt and the Salzburg patricians have always been proud. But what to do in this unusual case? It is not opportune for a father to step up and snatch his daughter from the prince's arms.

Auntie's sister-in-law tripped to Wilhelm Alt's side, wallowing in bliss. She has no idea of ​​the affront to her husband, she has only noticed the joyous award of her niece by the proud sovereign, seen with her own eyes how the ruler kissed Salome's hand as if the niece were a real princess. What luck, what honor for Salome, for the whole Alt family! Aunt sees the future in a rosy light. Who knows what honors intercourse with the princely court, with the archbishop, can still bring! After all, Wolf Dietrich has the best connections with the Vatican! Related to His Holiness! It can only cost him a word, and the aunt receives the papal blessing separately, just for herself! The mayoress was shocked at the boldness of her hopes, she remembered that her husband harbored nothing less than such Roman aspirations and valued his comfort more than the favor of a prince. But if it could be done secretly—the mayor didn't need to know all that, and especially that—the thought made her aunt dizzy, and involuntarily she leaned more firmly on her brother-in-law's arm.

Those who had not taken part in the tour, the younger citizens, squires, even those who plundered the bar, had lined up against the wall of the hall and formed a group in the corner, which was joined by the thoroughly troubled Mayor Alt, whose eyes did not give us much good seemed to announce. Many a biting word was said about the prince and his charms with Salome in this group, and the mayor did not prevent it. He was boiling, the treatment on the stairs had heated his blood. It annoys Alt no less that his wife appears transfigured at his brother's side, swimming in bliss, tripping after them and, by this silly pursuit, sanctioning the princely caresses, so to speak. Mayor Alt growled: "Stupid goose! And Wilhelm could also do something better

One of the boys who got too much of the southern wine crowed in a hoarse voice: "Look at the archbishop, who prances like a Spanish squire!"

And another, whose eyes had already become glassy, ​​gulped: "Fine - it will be in the E-e-er-z-st-st-pen!"

In the meantime, Wolf Dietrich and Salome had approached this group; the prince waved to the music, which suddenly broke off with a dissonance, and, holding his lady in his arms, addressed the mayor benevolently with consummate amiability and condescension: “Dear old man! Never die! You will forgive me that, under the spell of beauty, I did not wait for your report and disorder, and opened the party with the queen in person. Salzburg's most beautiful girl's flower justifies my behavior and explains the enthusiasm of my feelings! Happy a land in whose fields such flowers bloom, happy Salzburg, whose lord fills me with joyful pride! Well, my dear mayor, if it is your intention, let us begin the meal, but I wish that the queen of the festival will remain at the table as my partner!”

The mayor could not believe his ears, this gracious
speech threw all thoughts of revenge overboard, it had to
transform a dragon into a gentle lamb; At the very least, the city father felt that
clearly enough, such kindness requires a polite
answer of thanks, which, however, cannot be turned around in the blink of an eye,
for Mr. Ludwig Alt is not a gibberish and his thoughts
require a deliberate, leisurely sequence. "The graces of the High Prince
have rested!" That was the first attempt, and now a
moment must be considered as to what could be added.
But the lively prince interjected: "So you are never displeased, such forgiveness does you honor and shows the gentle mind of the faithfully concerned city father! I am not mistaken in assuming your approval. At table, then, and you, Mayor, I invite you to take the place on my left. At my right hand I keep the embodiment of beauty, queen of the feast!”

A fanfare blared through the hall, drowning in the
mayor's thanks.
"We'll take your wife with us!" Wolf Dietrich called out to the city father, whose ears were ringing.

The condescension of the sovereign had an igniting effect, the glittering assembly cheerily acclaimed the affable young prince, a fanfare from the musicians reinforced the roaring cheering, and people walked to the table with lively mobility. The mayoress, who had happily caught the master's words, was in a hurry to get to her husband's side, for which the overjoyed woman knew how to use her arms and make her way through the tangle of people. The gentlemen, who so rudely pushed Frau Alt aside, laughed at the protestation that the prince was longing for the city mother, and willingly let the woman, who was droll in her bliss, through. In this way, Frau Alt got to her husband, who, for better or for worse, had to accompany her to the table.

"May the Majesty of Beauty make me happy!" Whispered Wolf Dietrich as he and Salome approached the place of honor at the ceremonial table.

"High princely graces shower me with grace and favor undeservedly!" replied Salome, smiling and modestly lowering her eyelids.

"Oh no! Whose eyes trained by life in Eternal Rome can recognize true beauty, but language fails to praise it properly. I pay homage to the most beautiful queen the earth bears, and I beg you to accept this sincere homage in mercy!” A gentle pressure of his arm on Salome, then Wolf Dietrich released his lady, motioned to a noble boy and ordered him to wait on the lady.They sat down at the table, and as instructed, a lady always came to sit between two gentlemen. Frau Alt, whose cheeks turned the color of a corn rose from excitement, had hoped to be seated on the prince's left, but the husband suffered No, the exception was made here. In return, the city mother now sat between the Alt brothers, so still in the most distinguished proximity to the sovereign and guest of honour.

Even before the meal began, Wolf Dietrich had turned to his
companion: "I'm not mistaken, fate was in my
favour, and a lucky star recently brought you to my
palazzo?"
Salome raised her radiantly beautiful eyes to the master, then she nodded and whispered: "It wasn't a star, my father's order led me to the palace. My father is safe when it comes to money matters and that’s why the daughter has to come to Einhub.”

"So it was you after all, whom I only briefly saw at my Kastner!"

Salome nodded.

"And your father, lucky to have such a daughter who
embodies all charms, is he here in our circle?"
Salome quietly replied that her father had sat down on the left next to her aunt.

"And the mother?"

"The dear one has been torn from us for a long time!"

"How painful it must have been to part from such a child! But let's stay in the present!” Wolf Dietrich leaned back in his chair, the backrest of which was decorated with the coat of arms of Raittenau and the bishop's colors, in order to get a clear view of Wilhelm Alt. A short, scrutinizing, examining, piercing look, which gave the prince's face a hard expression, then benevolent affability returned to the face, and Wolf Dietrich called out to the merchant friendly, with winning kindness and condescension: "Wilhelm Alt, my greetings ! Forgive me for being so late in turning to you, counting your happiness on the beautiful daughter and thanking you for allowing me to have the queen of the festival as my partner!”

Wilhelm Alt had already stood up with the first words and shown the prince deep respect by bowing. But then the tradesman stood upright in front of the ruler, handsome to behold as a rich patrician well aware of his importance. A look speaking of love and fatherly pride flew over to Salome, a second was directed at the prince, and this look seemed to be scrutinizing, mistrustful, as if the father did not trust the young gentleman, who so little concealed his admiration and homage to the daughter do. The thanks for the speech was a bit cold, perfectly polite and respectful, but noticeably frosty.

Immediately the prince's face showed the line of inflexible hardness, the expression of arrogance, the look became piercing and scornful; but Wolf Dietrich mastered his feelings and facial expression in a worldly manner, the folds on his spiritually probing forehead smoothed out, and the young prince of the church smiled and greeted them with the words: "We thank you, Wilhelm Alt, and we don't want to deprive you of the pleasures of the table any longer!"

After another deep bow, the merchant resumed his seat, and his sister-in-law immediately questioned what the gracious gentleman had said. "I don't hear well in one ear, it's because of the bad weather!" added the curious mayor. Wilhelm Alt was malicious enough to whisper to his sister-in-law: "He wants to have a hop with you later!" Ms. Alt seemed to have understood the whispering completely, because contrary to etiquette she blurted out: "Not possible?" That sounded so funny, that even Salome couldn't suppress a giggle.

Wolf Dietrich had turned to the mayor when the course: "A yellow meal is mild to eat"[1] had been served, and spoke to the deferentially listening city ruler: "Now that we have the mild meal behind us, we also want milder food Be in the mood and hear what moves the hearts of my Salzburg residents.”

That sounded like music to the ears of Ludwig Alt, who, like the city council, had found it bitter enough that the sovereign, scarcely after taking office, hastily made use of the achievements of previous archbishops and carried out a revision of the people on the city council with regard to their attitude, which was bound to bring about a noticeable change in this instance.

However, Ludwig Alt did not fully trust the young ruler's "mild" mood, after all he wanted to try to use it for the benefit of the city, namely to regain the lost criminal jurisdiction. Alt said cautiously: "If we could ask one thing from the gracious lord in due respect, it would be that the mayor and the council would still have something to say, so to speak!"

Wolf threw up his witty head, his keen, quick sense had grasped in no time where the mayor was aiming, but he didn't want to betray the knowledge and therefore asked: "What does he mean by that?"

"If your high princely graces want to allow it graciously: We only have the executive, since Ew. Grace new Hofratsordnung came into force and this jurisdiction was also transferred to this archbishop's authority, and -"

At this weighty, even dangerous moment, Wilhelm Alt, who was listening to the meaningful conversation with great excitement, stepped on his brother's foot as a warning.

"And?" asked Wolf Dietrich with a lurking expression.
