He has always shown a taste for “horror”; I would have liked to throw it in the basket; he loved her; nevertheless he sometimes laughed at it, instead of speaking gravely to me in his letter; he is very keen to have this photograph as soon as possible, and he gives details, he tells me to contact Mr. Massouin, from the rue des Récollettes, too old to be mobilized and who has good cameras. I then have to put the original back in the desk drawer, between two boxes… what do I know! All of this saddens me.

Maurice came to see me yesterday.

“Just imagine, Maurice!…” I exclaimed.

He interrupted me:

" Take ! you no longer call me Monsieur Mahoudiaux? »

He had called me Madame Stork and I was punishing him for his impertinence.

"I don't feel like laughing," I replied; can you imagine that Roger…”

He interrupts me again:

“What new nonsense?

"Roger begs me to send him a photograph of the 'horror'!" What for, great God! »

So Maurice laughed at me, saying that I was taking a simple fancy tragically, that it didn't matter, that Roger would not stop being a little crazy from time to time, that I would end up getting sick (he may be right), and other good words.

Men are all the same! I write it, I repeat it to myself, to manage to believe it, and yet, I always hope that Roger… But no, Roger is probably as selfish as the others! “Maurice wants me to see life according to his common sense; Roger wants me to see life according to his crazy imagination… I condemn them a little hastily, without asking myself if I don't want everyone to see life in my own way.

Then?… Then it is impossible, in this world, to be happy; that's all, and I have only to renounce happiness as quickly as possible.

But what does he want to do with this ugly gouache? When the young Pélaze painted it, he considered his work as a simple "research for colors", as an amusement, and that was how he presented it to Roger. When Roger recognized me in the "horror" (I soon gave him that name), one evening when he was returning from the café-concert with Pélaze, I could not believe my ears. I remember Pélaze laughing, saying, “You're going a bit far, Maxence! no more your wife than the dancer we have just seen at the Tivoli! Brave little Pélaze!

Since then, Roger has spoken to me about it from time to time; he took it out of his drawer, he admired it, he spouted a thousand nonsense. When we had friends, he sometimes asked, showing "horror": "Do you recognize the model?" He was surprised that no one wanted to say the name he was expecting: mine.

Will he show it again? Whose ? "Is that my wife?" He would post me in his cagna? He would talk about me from "horror"? Would he publicly disrespect me? He would say to everyone: “Look at Lucienne Maxence! I can't console myself; I suffer, why not admit it? I am suffering ; I want to cry.

Alas! maybe he doesn't love me, since he wants me to be something other than I am… And I love him so much!

And then, this dreadful thought visits me: “You who love him so much, do you see him as he is? »

I'm doing my best ! I'm doing my best ! I swear I'm doing my best! But this ! that madness!… no… I don't understand. I am in pain.

CHAPTER XXIV
Cigogne has just introduced me to Madame Maxence … remotely, it is true, by an indirect method. 'I didn't receive anything interesting in the mail this evening, but the postman gave Cigogne a large canvas envelope, cardboard, carefully tied, registered.

“The portrait of my wife! finally ! »

I ask if it's a photograph.

“Of Lucienne? Do you think about it! I hate face pictures; they are always betrayals. No, one of our friends from Algiers had made a whimsical study of her, in gouache, very particular, and which I like. I wanted an exact photograph of it, here it is… Finally you will see. »

He cut the strings.

“It's quite reduced… and, of course, the colors are lacking, but you're a painter, you'll know how to make up for it. »

He handed me the thing. The thing… indeed.

There was hardly any way to express just what it was; nevertheless, if Madame Maxence resembled the person reproduced on the sheet Cigogne offered me , her legs were obviously too long; if she walked around in that costume, she must have often had trouble with the police; if she did her hair like this, her hairdresser, clever as he was, had a lot to do; finally, I hadn't imagined this entourage of large moths, languorous gazelles and orchids in a peaceful Breton port, or even, formerly, in Algiers: there were too many of them!

As an illustration of an oriental tale, of a ballet program, I think that this sketch, moreover elegant and witty drawn, would have suited well, because in the features of Mme Maxence, I still found Florimonde, unless it was not Yanthis, Melusine or some other princess (of music hall perhaps), but the wife of a young provincial chemist did not appear there.

“All the same, I said to Cigogne, to represent your wife vividly, I would have preferred a direct photo, my friend!

"Serval, you've never seen her." Here, I recognize her. »

Lucienne Maxence intrigues me more and more and I understand her letter less and less, her letter so quiet, so conjugally wise.

“And your wife, I asked Cigogne a few moments later, does she like this elegant gouache? »

He thinks, then:

"No, old man," he said, "I don't think she likes him."

- Take ! Ah!... well! really… "

And I changed the conversation.

CHAPTER XXV
I readily believe that the fairies surround us with their silent flight, that they watch over us, night and day, and sometimes even hold us captive for a few moments… These are moments of which we keep a long memory.

It is not about a white cat, nor about marvelous carpets, nor about a palace bathed in the moon and inhabited by a magician; no, simply, one suddenly feels transported elsewhere. There, time unfolds according to other laws, truer, more just, obvious (the only ones possible, it seems). We believe we are in the midst of a poem that is sad or joyful, robust, delicate, rustic or urban, sometimes harsh, tender, more often than not, but which never has anything to do with the hours we are living, because this new life is good to live with, it has taste, harmony, rhythm, beautiful colors, then, suddenly, the floor creaks, a branch breaks, the singing bird hits the wrong note, and here I am thrown back into this world here, where the countryside is muddy, where we complain about fate, where we kill each other in a way that is too ugly,

A similar adventure happened to me yesterday, in the company of Cigogne.

Our day of rest for both coincided, and we had decided, by mutual agreement, to spend it bourgeoisly in the village where, for several months, we have been billeted. Father Dietrich gladly lends us his dining room and, sometimes, he even discovers for our benefit, in his cellar, some old bottom of a bottle that smells good of plum. You see that Father Dietrich is a good man.

Cigogne and I were playing piquet in the small, very clean room whose wooden walls are decorated in such a naive, comical way. We took out and hung a portrait of Gambetta above the fireplace. The frock coat flutters in the wind, the tribune seems pleased with himself. To the right of the window, an image from Epinal tells us a very long, colorful story; on the left, cut out of I don't know what old "  Illustration  ", Queen Victoria crosses a ballroom, with great pomp; she is accompanied by Napoleon III. Rosettes of ribbons, old branches of boxwood, laurel, holly, complete the decoration, with a carefully patched ostrich egg, suspended in a red net, and which matches a hairy coconut.

We were cartoning, without speaking much, when a discussion arose on the other side of the partition. The next room is that of our hosts. Mrs. Dietrich complains to her husband about the harshness of the times; his voice is pathetic. Suddenly she appears, very wrapped up in a black woolen shawl, and goes to the door. Mr. Dietrich follows her sullenly. He stops in front of us.

"She shouldn't go out," he said. She goes as far as Ecklingen to see her nephew, Maria's son, who has bad bronchitis, but she leaves our little one at home and I can't stay because, you see, I have to go to the other end of the country to sell three hens to the colonel who has asked for them to be very fat because of the English officers he is receiving tomorrow. It will be a great feast. There will even be Champagne wine. »

He explains these things to us in a mixed Alsatian patois, full of unexpected words.

" I do not know what to do. It's sad,” he adds.

I object that the two eldest could keep their little sister, but then Mr. Dietrich complains.

"Hans, naughty boy, hasn't come in, nor Lisbeth either!" These two elders are terrible! always outside with the soldiers; with the commanding officer's order, today; they fish in the Largue. I don't care, they're nice, the soldiers, but they don't speak well… So the little one, all alone at home, will cry, will scream… It's very boring. »

Cigogne, by a major sixteenth supported by four kings, won the game. He wakes up.

“Carry your hens, Monsieur Dietrich, don't worry about the child. I'll read my newspapers in your room and if the little girl cries, if she cries, I'll be able to make her shut up and lull her to sleep by rocking her. »

Mr. Dietrich is very confused, but he nevertheless accepts, not without first offering us two glasses of plum. Offering a drink and tipping are different. M. Dietrich has all the delicacies; his latest is tasty and fragrant, thirty years in the bottle, he says.

Moments later, we were settled in the next room. It is hot there; the wooden bed, severe, in a dark brown tone, is adorned with a sky-blue eiderdown, very ridiculous, very obese. Another smaller bed is that of Hans and Lisbeth (pink comforter). Near the parents' bed, here is the cradle of the young Marguerite. She is ten months old and has a tiny chubby quilt, also pink, dotted with red flowers. Marguerite looks like a doll; she has the right colors of a doll, the fresh complexion, the health, the somewhat amazed expression. She delighted me immediately, because she held out her arms to me in a gesture of welcome, kindly. One could not put more simple grace and less literature into it. I must remind you that she is ten months old, therefore…

She charms Cigogne. We sit near her, we look at her. Cigogne doesn't read his newspapers, firstly because you can't see clearly enough in this tightly closed room, but also because the sheets get crumpled under your fingers and the children don't like the noise. … Isn't it, Marguerite?

Marguerite doesn't answer… Yes, she answers with a little bleat that can pass for a little cooing. His answer is both and seems delicious to us. Marguerite looks up. No ! never would a doll have such milky sweetness in her eyes! Marguerite sucks her finger, she puts her mouth forward as if for a kiss. She doesn't seem to want to sleep yet. This child is a marvel. I love it. We like it.

Now Marguerite sketches grimaces. Why ? Do we ever know ! So Cigogne cradles her gently, assiduously… We would kiss her. I do want to say that one would embrace Cigogne for the seriousness, for the conscience he puts into rocking Marguerite. Formerly, in high school, I saw some of my comrades, good students, apply themselves in a similar way to a problem which did not bother them and even (how much shall I say?) which clearly taught them something. — Again, Marguerite looks up and sucks her finger.Hey there! what does this veil of sadness suddenly covering Stork's face mean? I ask him, without words. You ask a question very well by raising your eyebrows, wrinkling your forehead, raising your chin a little. A questioning look can be as explicit as the sentence it implies. Cigogne thinks he must answer me verbally. This does not bother Marguerite. The chubby little head wobbles from right to left, following a gentle rhythm. These are, I think, the early signs of sleep. Then Cigogne grows bolder: if he still speaks low, he speaks at length; his conversation proceeds in long tangled murmurs.

I will make no remark; I will be silent, I will listen to Cigogne. It will take a long time… By the way, who is he talking to? To Margaret? to Marguerite asleep?... Let's listen.

“You give me rest, you give me peace; this is how I would have liked to live, close to your cradle. Sleep, my child! She… she would be in the next room, yes, in that next room…”

Ah! take ! will he tell us about...

“She would knit a little blue bra for you. Through the half-open door, I would hear him breathing. She trusts me, she knows that I protect you. If you cry, she won't even bother. Am I not here to rock you, to put you to sleep? »

What do you want ! he is proud of his new talents!

“Oh! if you cough, she will come right away. Men are so clumsy! But, for the moment, she is calm. Her fingers move gently, noiselessly, and under her fingers the bra lengthens; under his fingers, the wool is supple. Fairies should knit like this. Sleep, my child! Life is good to live; you sleep, I rock you and your mother composes marvelous clothes for you. The moon outside is pouring money on the campaign…”

I was waiting for the moon! Note that it is not five o'clock in the afternoon.

“In the chimney, the wind will sigh from time to time, but not too much: it knows very well that you are sleeping; the passing wind is your friend. A dog will bark in the yard; you know him, the big yellow dog, so hairy, so clumsy, he will never scare you; the big yellow dog is your friend; and we will hear the swallows crying as they shear the air around the roof…”

Where the hell did he see the swallows fly at night, since he wants it to be night, and around what roof?

“Later, I will teach you to love all those things which surround you and which make the beauty of the world, all those things which passers-by despise: the song of the streams, the color of the twilight and its reflection in the ponds, the perfumes that the breezes bring, the thin voice of a toad lost in the green meadow…”

This toad, he may show it to him...

“And you will laugh watching, listening, breathing life, like… like… like a…”

Decidedly, the comparison does not come. So he takes a side road.

“And the more you laugh, the happier I will be, because in your laughter I will find the laughter that I love so much, your mother's laughter. Your mother… listen… she pushes the door. It's you, my friend! I rocked the child! »

So there she is, our dear Lucienne! She was really missed at the party! Since Cigogne evokes you, enter Madame!

“She comes to put a flower in this vase, this flower deifies the room… Magic, no doubt, this flower… Don't wake up, my little one. Ah! the glorious corolla! It needed a red stain on this dark brown background…”

The insolent! he talks about painting! The colors are my game! I'm not talking about dreams, me!

“Oh! my darling child, take a good look at your mother! See how lightly she walks…”

But N… de D…, since she's sleeping, this kid!

“His foot barely lands. See how the red flower trembles in her industrious hand, so delicate, so pretty. »

Industrious hand is not bad! I like this memory of the recent bra.

“Your mother seems to transform everything around her. Now we live in a dream, on the other side of a big mirror; we crossed it. You will be a princess, darling; I'll teach you how to do it, I'll teach you how to behave, I'll take care of the pomp of your court, but for the moment, sleep, child, don't think of the Blue Bird! sleep in peace, life is quite beautiful like this, sweet and so tender, isn't it? Listen to the clock, it gives us our happiness, drop by drop…”

The image is not very new, it seems to me, nor very sure…

“Let us live the daily happiness that poor men lost in the noise of cities do not know; never ask for more. Sleep, darling, and I will rock you. »

I was going to write another review, but what's the point, since I'm moved? because here I am in this dream where Cigogne, by his low murmured speech, had invited me, where I slipped without almost realizing it... yes, the bottom of the mirror... I am at the bottom of the mirror... Why make fun of me de Cigogne when I should give him thanks?

Suddenly the door opens, for good this time, and Mme Dietrich enters with a loud noise, coming from Ecklingen, an umbrella in her hand, a woolen scarf over her hair. Marguerite wakes up with a start, she looks at her mother with a terrified air, she waves her arms, her rosy face puffs up, she cries. Ah! I can say that Marguerite cries well! The mother comes running. What a solid step! what insurance! She takes the doll from its cradle, without formalities (Stork would think: without tenderness!) she shakes it. Marguerite bellows. So many voices in such a small body! But Mrs. Dietrich is not moved for so little.

“My good gentlemen! go into the kitchen, the child will make too much noise. »

The beautiful palace of dreams is on the ground.

Erect, arms dangling, one leg bent, Cigogne looks at the empty cradle with Perrette's expression after the milk jug has fallen.

CHAPTER XXI
He talked to me again about that hour spent cradling little Dietrich, he talks about it often. He praises the sweetness of married life, of fatherhood, he is moved by his words, he likes the picture they compose, he looks delighted, his eyes are wet with happy tears, he smiles complacently. In his depths, I think he is in despair.

And it's the same story every time, every time he opens his heart to me. He tastes the supposed happiness of another, he attributes it to himself, he sees himself happy, then he laments that he is not happy, and when he himself experiences something, he neither suffers nor suffers from it. enjoys it: he dreams of being someone who would otherwise suffer or enjoy.I told you that it is so every time he opens his heart to me. With some beings, opening one's heart is a big deal that requires restraint; they keep this heart under lock and key, the secret lock cannot be broken into. Others open their hearts constantly, at the slightest request or even without being asked; Whoever wants to look into this easy heart, whoever wants to enter it; you only pay when you leave. Still others put their hearts out there, but those really aren't of interest. Cigogne belongs to another school. He opens his heart to his friends as soon as his heart is full, but you never find what you thought you saw there.

Imagine a fruiterer claiming to offer amateurs only mangoes, avocados, prickly pears, tasty litchis, freshly picked; he even painted the images on the sign of his shop. You enter. He hands you an apple from Normandy, excellent, moreover, not overripe, very edible, but you can't help but say to yourself: "I thought I was tasting exotic fruits, this honest Normandy apple doesn't tell me anything worthwhile!" And we show his bad humor (me, at least).

Or, if you prefer a comparison closer to our friend Cigogne, remember how nasty the theater accepts a late change of show that forces you to listen to a joke when you want to cry over the fate of two orphan girls ( we have nothing else to do that evening; we must stay!) or who wets your eyes when you wanted to laugh. Cigogne never knows exactly what is going on inside him, but he invites his friends to the performance on the strength of a poster whose color amuses him and which he has peeled off from a nearby wall.

Thus Roger Maxence complains that his wife has not given him any children. Returning home, he will not find a little Marguerite sleeping in a cradle with a little eiderdown stitched with flowers. And he also complains that Mme Dietrich has a heavy step and a strong voice, while Lucienne's voice is, I think, the murmur of a flute and her step the evanescence of down .

Because of this, Stork will be unhappy until the next opportunity. She showed up yesterday.

During our days of boredom, in the trenches (they are frequent), I lend Cigogne books which my family sends me and which she knows how to choose. I take advantage of the criticism, sometimes singular, that our friend presents to me (because I beg you to believe that he is not stupid), and, at the same time, I bring back to the point old opinions whatever little academic that I had kept from certain works. If I like Cigogne's criticism, it's because he has the gift of living what he reads. This often gives his denigrations, his enthusiasms, a sincere eloquence. This ability to incorporate oneself into the dream of others does not work, alas! without any drawbacks.

The day before yesterday, Lucienne (he authorizes me to call her that), wrote Roger a very nice letter, very simple and very quiet, restful, smelling good of the provinces; Florimonde had to be four in composing that letter, provided that the feather of an exotic bird was still trembling, heavy at the tip, in her hair. Cigogne asked me to go through it (I no longer protest against this indiscretion) and I told him how happy I was to know Madame Maxence in good health and Maurice Mahoudiaux flourishing, despite his troublesome injury. But, this afternoon, Cigogne boasted to me, with sudden ardour, of the romantic union of two beings whose love is nourished by heroic actions, superhuman and constantly repeated sacrifices (hadn't he read , the day before, some play by Musset?).Now, as we were returning on horseback to the cantonment, around six o'clock, I was astonished to see Cigogne, passing in front of a Calvary, uncovering himself and completing his homage by a large sign of the cross. I didn't know he had any religious feelings, at least he had never expressed any explicitly before.

“Do you salute the Calvaries? I said to him, is it a pious habit?

- Oh ! no ! he replied embarrassed.

— I like the gesture, it is touching, but…

- So leave! he said, shrugging his shoulders.

"Why is that?... Are you a believer?"

"No, or at least...

- So ?

— That peasant just now saluted… saluted a cross so beautifully!

- Corn…

— I thought that I would manage to touch this Christ by saluting him in my turn… He died for us… I told him of my gratitude by doing like the peasant.
