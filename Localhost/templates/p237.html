The arrogance of the devil is so great and so stubborn, that he always desires and seeks to be had and honored by God: and in all that he can steal and appropriate to himself what is due only to the Most High God, he does not cease to do so in the blind nations. of the world, to whom the light and splendor of the holy Gospel has not yet enlightened. Of this so proud tyrant we read in Job[1] , who sets his eyes on the highest; and that among all the sons of pride he is the King. The damaged attempts of him and betrayal of him so daring, with which he pretended to match his[two] throne with that of God, very clearly the divine Scriptures tell us, saying in Isaiah[2] : You said to yourself: I will ascend to Heaven, I will set my chair above all the stars of God, I will sit on the summit of the Testament, on the slopes of Aquilon, I will surpass the height of the clouds, I will be like the Most High . And in Ezekiel[3] : Your heart lifted up, and you said: I am God, and I have sat on God's chair in the midst of the sea . This wicked appetite to make himself God still lasts Satan; and although the just and severe punishment of the Most High took away all the pomp and freshness, for which he became so proud, treating him as his discourtesy and madness deserved, as in the same Prophets it is continued at length; but that did not loosen his perverse intention one point, which shows in every way that he can, like a rabid dog, biting the very sword with which they wound him[4] . Because the pride, as it is written, of those who hate God, always persists. From here comes the perpetual and strange care that this enemy of God has always had to make himself adored by men, inventing so many kinds of idolatries, with which he has been subject for so many times.[3] most of the world, that hardly a corner of his people Israel was left to God[5] . And with the same tyranny, after the fort of the Gospel defeated him, and disarmed and entered by force of the Cross the most important and powerful squares of his Kingdom, he attacked the most remote and barbarous peoples, trying to preserve among them the false and lying divinity that the Son of God had taken from him in his Church, locking him up like a beast, in a cage, so that he would be to his derision and the delight of his servants, as it means by Job[6] . But finally, since idolatry was extirpated from the best and noblest part of the world, it withdrew to the most distant, and reigned in this other part of the world, which although in nobility much inferior, in greatness and breadth it is not. The reasons why the devil has so strongly encouraged idolatry in all infidelity, that there are hardly any people who are not idolaters, and the reasons for this are mainly two. One is, the one who is touched by his incredible arrogance, which, whoever wants to ponder well, considers that the very Son of God and true God attacked, with saying so shamelessly[7] , let him prostrate himself before him and worship him;[4] and this he told him, though not knowing for certain that it was God himself; but having at least great inklings that he was the Son of God. Who will not be amazed by such a strange attack? Such excessive and cruel pride? How much that ignorant peoples worship by God the one who attacked God himself, by making him God, being such a dirty and abominable creature? Another cause and motive for idolatry is the deadly hatred and enmity that he has with men. Because as the Savior says[8] : From the beginning he was a murderer, and this is inseparable from his wickedness as a condition and property. And because he knows that the greatest damage to man is to adore the creature for God, for this reason he does not cease to invent forms of idolatry with which to destroy men and make them enemies of God. And there are two evils that the devil does to the idolater: one that denies his God, according to that[9] : You abandoned the God who created you: another who is subject to something lower than him, because all creatures are inferior to the rational; and the devil, although in nature he is superior to man, but in status he is far inferior, for man in this life is capable of[5] divine and eternal life. And so everywhere with idolatry God is dishonored and man destroyed; and by both ways the arrogant and envious demon very happy.

CHAPTER II
Of the genres of idolatries that the Indians have used.

Idolatry, says the Sage, and through it the Holy Spirit[10] , which is the cause and beginning and end of all evils; and for this reason the enemy of men has multiplied so many kinds and kinds of idolatry, that to think of counting them often is an infinite thing. But reducing idolatry to heads, there are two lineages of it: one is close to natural things: another close to imagined or manufactured things.[6] by human invention. The first of these is divided into two, because either the thing that is worshiped is general, like Sun, Moon, fire, earth, elements: or it is particular, like such a river, fountain, or tree or mountain, and when not by its species, but in particular these things are adored: and this kind of idolatry was used in Peru in great excess, and is properly called Guaca. The second kind of idolatry, which belongs to human invention or fiction, also has two other differences: one from what consists of pure human art and invention, such as worshiping idols or statues made of wood, or of stone or gold, as of Mercury or Pallas, which outside of that painting or sculpture, is nothing, nor was it anything. Another difference is, from what something really was and is; but not what the idolater who adores him feigns, like the dead or his things, that for vanity and flattery men adore. Luckily, for all of us we count four forms of idolatry used by the infidels; and of all it will be convenient to say something.

[7]

CHAPTER III
That in the Indians there is some knowledge of God.

Firstly, although the darkness of infidelity has obscured the understanding of those nations, in many things it does not leave the light of truth and reason to work in them so much: and thus they commonly feel and confess a supreme Lord and Maker of all, at which the Peruvians called Viracocha, and gave him a name of great excellence, such as Pachacamac or Pachayachachic, who is the creator of Heaven and earth, and Usapu, who is admirable, and others like him. They worshiped him, and he was the main one they venerated looking at Heaven. And the same is found in his manner in those of Mexico, and today in the Chinese and in other infidels. Which is very similar to what the book of the Acts of the Apostles refers to[11] , having found Saint Paul in Athens, where he saw a[8] altar entitled: Ignoto Deo : to the unknown God. Whence the Apostle took occasion to preach about him, saying to them: Whom you venerate without knowing him, he is the one I preach to you. And so in the same way, those who today preach the Gospel to the Indians do not find much difficulty in persuading them, that there is a supreme God and Lord of all, and that this is the God of the Christians, and the true God. Although it is something that has amazed me a lot, that with having this news that I say, they did not have their own word to name God. Because if we want in the language of the Indians to find a word that responds to this, God, as in Latin it responds Deus , and in Greek Theos , and in Hebrew El , and in Arabic Allah, is not found in the language of Cuzco, nor in the language of Mexico; whereby those who preach or write for the Indians use the same Spanish as ours, God, accommodating themselves in the pronunciation and declaration to the property of the Indian languages, which are very diverse. From where it is seen, how short and thin news they had of God, because even naming him they do not know except by our word. But in fact they did not stop having some as is; and so they built a very rich temple for him in Peru, which they called the Pachamac, which was the main Sanctuary of that Kingdom. And as it has been said, Pachacamac is the same as the Creator: although they also exercised their idolatries in this temple, worshiping the Devil[9] and his figures. And they also made sacrifices and offerings to Viracocha, and he had the supreme place among the shrines that the Inca Kings had. And calling the Spaniards viracochas was from here, because they were considered children of Heaven and divine, in the same way that the others attributed deity to Paul and Barnabas, calling one Jupiter, and the other Mercury, and trying to offer them sacrifice as to gods. And in the same tone the other barbarians of Melite, which is Malta, seeing that the viper did no harm to the Apostle, called him God[12] . For as it be true, so according to all good reason, there should be a Sovereign Lord and King of Heaven, which the Gentiles[13] , with all their idolatry and infidelity, they did not deny, as it seems in the Philosophy of Tim√©o of Plato, and of the Metaphysics of Aristotle, and Asclepius of Trismegistro, as well as in the Poetry of Homer and Virgil. Hence it is that in establishing and persuading this truth of a supreme God, the Evangelical preachers do not suffer much difficulty, however barbarous and bestial the nations to whom they preach may be. But it is very difficult for them to uproot from their understandings that there is no other God, nor another[10] deity there is but one; and that everything else does not have its own power, nor its own being, nor its own operation, more than what it gives them, and communicates that supreme and only God and Lord. And this is extremely necessary to persuade them by all means, reproving their errors universally, to worship more than one God. And much more in particular, of having as Gods, and attributing deity, and asking favor of other things that are not Gods, nor can they do anything, more than what the true God, Lord and Maker of theirs grants them.

CHAPTER IV
From the first kind of idolatry of natural and universal things.

After the Viracocha or supreme God, it was and is in the Infidels that they most commonly venerate and adore, the Sun, and after him those other things, that in the[eleven] celestial or elemental nature are indicated, such as moon, star, sea, earth. The Incas, Lords of Peru, after the Viracocha and the Sun, the third guaca or shrine, and other veneration, put the thunder, which they called by three names, Chuquilla, Catuilla and Intiillapa, pretending that it is a man who is in the Heaven with a slingshot and a club, and that it is in his power to rain, hail, thunder, and everything else that belongs to the region of the air, where clouds are made. This was Guaca (which is how they call their shrines) general to all the Indians of Peru, and they offered various sacrifices to it. And in Cuzco, which was the Court and Metropolis, children were also sacrificed to him like to the Sun. These three that I have mentioned, Viracocha, Sol and Thunder, they adored in a different way from all the others, as Polo writes having found out, which was putting one like a mitten or glove on the hands when they raised them, to adore them. They also adored the earth, which they called Pachamama, as the Ancients celebrated the Goddess Tellus: and the sea, which they called Mamacocha, as the Ancients did Tethys or Neptune. They also adored the arch of Heaven, and it was weapons or insignia of the Inca with two snakes at the sides at length. Among the stars, everyone commonly adored the one they call Collca, which we call the Cabrillas. They attributed various offices to various stars, and it was weapons or insignia of the Inca with two snakes at the sides at length. Among the stars, everyone commonly adored the one they call Collca, which we call the Cabrillas. They attributed various offices to different stars, and it was weapons or insignia of the Inca with two snakes at the sides at length. Among the stars, everyone commonly adored the one they call Collca, which we call the Cabrillas. They attributed various offices to various stars,[12] and those who needed their favor adored them; Just as the sheepherders worshiped and sacrificed to a star, which they called Urcuchillai, which they say is a ram of many colors, which understands the conservation of cattle, and is understood to be the one that astrologers call Lira. And they adore two others who walk near her, whom they call Catuchillay, Urcuchillay, who pretend to be a sheep with a lamb. Others adored a star, which they call Machacuay, in whose charge the snakes and snakes are, so that they do not harm them; As if in charge of another star, which they called Chuquichinchay, which is a tiger, there are the tigers, bears and lions. And generally, of all the animals and birds that exist on earth, they believed that there was a similar one in Heaven, whose charge was their procreation and increase; and so they had various stars, such as the one they called Chacana, Topatorca, Mamana, Mirco, Miquiquiray, and so on, which in some way seem to be pulling at the dogma of Plato's ideas. The Mexicans, almost in the same way, after the supreme God worshiped the Sun; and so Hernando Cort√©s, as he refers to in a letter to Emperor Carlos V, was called son of the Sun, because of the speed and vigor with which he surrounded the earth. But the greatest adoration they gave to the Idol called Vitzilipuztli, to which all that nation They called him Son of the Sun, because of the speed and vigor with which he circled the earth. But the greatest adoration they gave to the Idol called Vitzilipuztli, to which all that nation They called him Son of the Sun, because of the speed and vigor with which he circled the earth. But the greatest adoration they gave to the Idol called Vitzilipuztli, to which all that nation[13] called the Almighty and Lord of the created; and as such, the Mexicans built the most sumptuous and tallest temple, and the most beautiful and gallant building, whose site and strength can be conjectured by the ruins that have remained of it in the middle of the city of Mexico. But in this part the idolatry of the Mexicans was more erroneous and pernicious than that of the Incas, as will be better seen later. Because most of their worship and idolatry was occupied with idols, and not with the natural things themselves, although these natural effects were attributed to idols, such as rain and cattle, war, generation, like the Greeks. and Latins also put idols of Phoebus, of Mercury, of Jupiter, of Minerva, and of Mars, &c. Finally, whoever looks at it carefully will find that the way the Devil has had to deceive the Indians,[14] ponder well the Wisefor these words[14] : Vain and mistaken are all men, in whom the knowledge of God is not found. Well, of the same things that have a good appearance, they did not finish understanding the one that truly has to be. And looking at his works, they did not hit the Author and artificer, but the fire, or the wind, or the rushing air, or the circle of the stars, or the many waters, or the Sun, or the Moon, believed that they were gods and rulers of the world. But if, enamored of the beauty of such things, they seemed to regard them as gods, it is reason for them to look at how much more beautiful the Maker of them is, since the giver of beauty is the one who made all these things. And if you were amazed at the strength and wonderful work of these things, by themselves they finish understanding how much more powerful than all of them will be the one who gave them the being they have.So far they are words from the book of Wisdom. From which very wonderful and effective arguments can be taken to convince the great deception of the infidel idolaters, who want more to serve and revere the creature, than the Creator, as justly[fifteen] the Apostle argues[fifteen]. But because this is not from the present attempt, and it is done quite a lot in the sermons that were written against the errors of the Indians, suffice for now to say that they had the same way of worshiping the Supreme God. Because the way to worship Viracocha, and the Sun, and the stars, and the other Guacas or Idols, was to open your hands, and make a certain sound with your lips, like someone who kisses, and ask for what each one wanted. , and offer him sacrifice. Although there was a difference in the words, when they spoke with the great Ticciviracocha, to whom they mainly attributed the power and control of everything, and to the others as gods or individual lords, each one in his house, and who were intercessors for the great Ticciviracocha. This way of worshiping by opening your hands and kissing,[16] : If I kissed my hands with my mouth looking at the Sun, when it shines, or at the Moon, when it is clear: which is very great wickedness, and to deny the most high God .

[16]

CHAPTER V
Of the idolatry that the Indians used with particular cases.

The devil was not satisfied with making the blind Indians worship the Sun, the Moon, the stars, the earth, the sea, and general things of nature; but he went ahead to give them for gods, and subject them to small things, and many of them very coarse. He will not be frightened of this blindness in barbarians, who brings to memory that of the Wise Men and Philosophers the Apostle says[17] , who, having known God, did not glorify him or give thanks as to their God; but they were puffed up at the thought of him, and their foolish hearts were darkened, and they came to exchange the glory and deity of the eternal God, for likenesses and figures of perishable and corruptible things, such as men, birds, beasts, snakes. Well known thing is the dog[17] Osiris, which the Egyptians adored, and the cow Isis, and the ram Amon: and in Rome the goddess Februa of fevers, and the Anser of Tarpeia: and in Athens the wise woman, the raven and the rooster. And the memories of gentility are full of such baseness and ridicule, men coming to such great disgrace for not wanting to submit to the law of their true God and Creator, as Saint Athanasius wisely treats him writing against idolaters. But in the Indians, especially in Peru, it is something that brings to light the breakage and perdition that there was in this. Because they adore the rivers, the springs, the ravines, the rocks or large stones, the hills, the tops of the mountains that they call apachitas, and they have it as a thing of great devotion; finally, anything of nature that seems remarkable and different from the rest, they worship it as recognizing there some particular Deity. In Cajamalca de la Nasca they showed me a large hill of sand, which was the main shrine or guaca of the ancients. Asking what divinity they found there, they answered me, that wonder of being a very high hill of sand in the middle of many others all of rock. And truly it was a marvelous thing to think how such a great peak of sand was placed in the midst of very thick mountains of stone. To cast a big bell we had in the city of the Kings And truly it was a marvelous thing to think how such a great peak of sand was placed in the midst of very thick mountains of stone. To cast a big bell we had in the city of the Kings And in truth it was a marvelous thing to think how such a great peak of sand was placed in the midst of very thick mountains of stone. To cast a big bell we had in the city of the Kings[18] There was a need for a lot of strong firewood, and a misshapen tree was cut down, which due to its antiquity and greatness had been a shrine and guaca of the Indians for many years. At this tone, anything that is strange among those of its kind, seemed to them to have a divinity, even doing this with pebbles and metals, and even roots and fruits of the earth, as in the roots that are called potatoes there are some strange ones, to whom they name them llallahuas, and they kiss and adore them. They also adore bears, lions, tigers and snakes, because they do not harm them. And as their gods are such, so are the things they offer them graceful when they worship them. They use when they are on the road, throw on the same roads or crossroads, on the hills, and mainly on the peaks that they call apachitas, old shoes and feathers, chewed coca, which is a herb that they use a lot, and when they can't take it anymore, not even a stone; and all this is as an offering so that they let them pass, and give them strength, and they say that they charge for it with this: as referred to in a Provincial Council of Peru[18] . And thus, very large piles of these offered stones, and other said filth, are found on those paths. Such nonsense as the Ancients used,[19] of whom it is said in the Proverbs[19] : As one who offers stones to the heap of Mercury, so he who honors fools, which is to say, that one does not get more fruit, nor utility, from the second than from the first: because not even the Mercury of stone feels the offering, not even the fool knows how to thank the honor they do him. They use another no less graceful offering, which is to pull their eyelashes or eyebrows, and offer them to the sun, or to the hills and apachitas, to the winds, or to the things they fear. Such is the misfortune in which they have lived, and today many Indians live, that as the devil makes them understand as boys he wants, no matter how great nonsense they may be, just as St. Chrysostom makes such a comparison of the Gentiles in a Homily[20] . But the servants of God, who pay attention to his teaching and salvation, should not despise these trifles, since they are such that they are enough to bind them to their eternal perdition. But with good and easy reasons to disabuse them of such great ignorance. Because it is true to ponder how subject they are to someone who puts them to reason. There is nothing among corporeal creatures more illustrious than the Sun, and it is whom the Gentiles all commonly adore. Well, with good reason, a discreet and good Captain told me[twenty] Christian, who had persuaded the Indians that the Sun was not God, but only a servant of God; and it was like that. He asked the Cacique and principal Lord to give him a light Indian to send a letter: he was given such, and the Captain asked the Cacique: tell me, who is the Lord and the principal, that Indian who carries the letter so lightly, or you? what do you send her to take? The Cacique answered, I, without any doubt, because that one doesn't do more
