Farmers, servants and maids surround the farmstead of Servaz Amareller, farmer in Hemmernmoos, in great excitement and discuss the unprecedented case of a large-scale theft of money. After the skinny little Amareller's repeated protestations in a wailing tone, a wallet with more than five hundred guilders, the amount for the cattle sold, was mysteriously stolen from a well-locked chest. Yesterday, Servaz Amareller counted the bills to make sure the amount of money was there, after which the chest was carefully locked and the key hidden in the oven hole. Today the money has disappeared, although no stranger was seen in the house and the key was found in the ashes. The neighbors, informed of the surprising news, agree with the wailing victim that only one of the people in the house could have carried out the theft himself, because there are no signs of a forced entry either on the front door or on the windows, which are barred with iron bars. The farmers have twice examined the front and sides of the homestead for signs of a break-in from the outside, and there is not the slightest thing to be found. But the money is gone, the chest blown open. Amareller's youngest had to go to the gendarmerie immediately after discovering the theft, and a gendarme is expected to arrive at any moment. because there are no signs of a forced entry either on the front door or on the windows, which are barred with iron bars.

But the money is gone, the chest blown open. Amareller's youngest had to go to the gendarmerie immediately after discovering the theft, and a gendarme is expected to arrive at any moment. because there are no signs of a forced entry either on the front door or on the windows, which are barred with iron bars. The farmers have twice examined the front and sides of the homestead for signs of a break-in from the outside, and there is not the slightest thing to be found. But the money is gone, the chest blown open. Amareller's youngest had to go to the gendarmerie immediately after discovering the theft, and a gendarme is expected to arrive at any moment.

The peasants lively discussed the question of who could be sufficiently suspicious of such a crime, unheard of in the Tyrol. The inhabitants are quite honest people, having been for years at least until yesterday; without outward signs of intrusion, it cannot be otherwise than that one of the servants is guilty of theft. But who?

One of the neighbors asked whether the Amareller's dog hadn't reported anything. The skinny Servaz protested: "Sell is free from the Weis'! No si' a Dörcher zurwig'wagg and just tonight a crime has to happen! I understand now how Sall Öpper was able to see it! Searches such a sharp dog, and just tonight he lets out, the Saggrasultan! I can understand it now!"

The others don't understand the case that the farm dog, known to be sharp and snappy, is said to have let a thief in.

The Falgerbauer concluded that the thief must have either brought a sausage for the sultan or sneaked in while the dog was not there.

People talked for about two hours about the mysterious theft and drank from Amareller's willingly served Röthel, because such a heated discourse generates so much thirst.

But when the figure of the approaching gendarme became visible, the bottle and glasses were immediately sent back to the house, whereby Amareller said it was not proper to drink wine in front of the authorities, especially when more than five hundred guilders in cash had been stolen. If the tax office could find out that someone still had wine in the cellar despite the theft, how easy it would be for the tax office to rate you higher in tax for that.

The falger agreed. "It's good, oh, and a gendarme needs Röthel!"

The greeting of the security man was short, who now recorded the facts according to regulations and duty and had the Amareller tell him about the case. That took another hour, it was time to eat and the lard noodles smelled lovely from the house. The neighbors now wanted to obey such a warning and go home, but the gendarme explained that the district judge, the examining magistrate, could arrive with the commission at any moment, so the people had to stay put.

But now none of the peasants, who had hitherto been unable to chatter enough about the mysterious theft, wanted to stay any longer, and they said openly that they wanted nothing to do with the court. Now the gendarme ordered them to stay until the judge arrived, and the farmers stayed in front of the Hemmernmooshof, now quiet and withdrawn.

Soon after, the judge drove up with the clerk, silently greeted by the now timid, shy peasants. After the gendarme's report, the judge, a tall figure with strangely sharp, piercing eyes and a high forehead, went about his official business by interrogating the Amarellian who had been robbed. Servaz had spoken less than ten sentences when the judge interrupted him with the question: "Is the farm dog male?"

Surprised, Amareller stammered. "It'll probably be like that!"

The judge spoke loudly, so that all those present could hear: "That's just the old and eternally stupid story. You peasants always keep male dogs, villagers and travelers always keep females. And then you farmers are surprised and can't understand that your yard dogs let strangers in without a sound! Serves you right! So the farm dog didn't report, good. Did you find any sign on the outside?”

Servaz denied this question and referred to the completely intact window grilles.

The judge walked slowly from window to window on the first floor, pulling a collapsible ruler from his pocket, with which he measured the rung spacing in the trellis.

Amareller said in astonishment. "With all due respect, Mr. Judge, no one will be able to slip through these bars!"

"You keep quiet until you're asked again!" replied the judge, named Ehrenstraßer, and then checked the grating for any construction errors, whereupon the order was given that everyone present should go into the hallway of the house. Now the judge gave his full attention to the ground around the homestead, looking for tracks and footprints. The ground around the house is gravelly, hard, nothing to be found. But already at a short distance the ground becomes soft, corresponding to the significant farmstead name (Hemmern = Nißwurz, moss-marshy ground), and the judge did not have to search long before he came across shoe prints in the mossy ground, a track of surprising properties. On one occasion the prints are found pointing strongly outwards, causing the judge to combine, that the producer of this track has flat feet. The next examination of the trail, however, overthrew the suspicion that it could have come from the thief, for the trail, according to the imprints in the soft ground, leads towards the house, not away from it.

The judge was somewhat surprised by this fact and went towards the trail, further into the moorland, until it got lost on the path boards laid to protect passers-by.

If this trail is the one leading to the house, then the trail leading away from the house must be found. With the greatest care and thoroughness the judge searched for the trail of departure, striving and using all his official experience in this search, but he could not find a footprint leading from the house. So Ehrenstrasser returned to the leading track and dug several imprints with characteristic nail impressions out of the ground in order to keep them with the greatest care between the cardboard covers he had brought with him and to include them in the field bag, which the investigating magistrate carried around his neck like the officers did wears on the left hip.

Now the clerk was called and everything pertinent about the observations made was dictated to him. To the peasants' greatest astonishment, the judge now had them step out in front of the house one by one, with Ehrenstrasser paying close attention to the formation of their feet. Not one of the people, not even the servants, has flat feet.

The judge sent the neighbors who had become superfluous home and now took the servants individually, who, according to the Amareller, must be suspicious because the window bars remained undamaged.

Like the first servant, the judge used a ruler to measure the transverse diameter of the head, half of which was the mouth of the infinitely surprised man.

"Resign! Next up!” was the order. A slightly built young fellow approached, who now had to stretch his right arm up over his head. The boy's head was quickly measured along with his arms stretched up, and the result made the judge suspicious, because the diameter of the head including the arm was exactly 14 cm and the rung distances are the same. This made it clear to the examining magistrate that this fellow can slip through the grating rung distance and that the grating with a rung distance of 14 cm does not constitute an obstacle to intrusion from the outside. Therefore, if the fellow is the thief, he need not enter from the outside.

The judge considered it useless to measure the heads of the others, after the removal of the grating bars ensured the possibility of intrusion from the outside. The investigation has now been extended to the house inside and the chest.

The local inspection didn't offer much. The judge found that the chest could be opened like a suitcase by lifting the lid. The castle was rusty and old; hardly fit to offer any particular resistance; the wood of the chest was just as old and rotten. Ehrenstrasser took a close look at the spot where the unknown thief must have used a tool to force the lid open. It can be clearly seen that a chisel was inserted just next to the lock between the uppermost edge of the front wall and the lid, the wood shows the imprint of the tool in question and shows that downward pressure must have been exerted on the handle of the tool . So the iron has to go down into the front wall of the chest at the same time,

This observation supplemented further investigation, which revealed that by the time the iron pressed into the board, the wood was very strong in texture. The impression shows that the iron must have been narrower at the front.

The examining magistrate carefully examined the inside of the opened lid and found that at the point where the iron end exerted the pressure, there was a figuration running jaggedly downwards. The judge immediately combined that the tool could not have been a normal crowbar, but rather a kind of screwdriver, one corner of which must have broken off at the blade. But this corner piece could not be found, no matter how hard Ehrenstrasser tried. The distances between the pressure points were then measured and the results dictated to the recorder. Without having the instrument itself, the blade is now 38mm wide, before the corner was snapped off it was 41mm wide, and the chisel measured 94mm from the blade towards the hilt, a width of 54 mm had to have.

Further successes could not be achieved. Nevertheless, the conscientious judge now interrogated the servants, and first the kitchen maid Gretl, a strong young person, was quoted, who appeared trembling in the interrogation room.

Ehrenstrasser addressed the usual preliminary questions to the person in High German, but received no answer, so he repeated the questions in dialect. Now the maid understood him and announced her nationality.

"Did you notice anything special last night?" asked the judge.

The maid changed color, became pale, then red again, a tremor ran through her whole body, an unmistakable fear was read on her face. Stuttering, Gretl protested: "I certainly didn't steal anything!"

"I think so too! But you must tell me what you saw that night. Anyone got in?”

"Now I know!"

"Is someone past your door?"

"Hall already!"

"And what happened then?"

"I can't say, I slept too hard and didn't wake up until it was over!"

"What was over?"

Hesitatingly and with great shyness, the wench confessed that when she woke up she had a straw wreath around her head.

"Have you turned down a fellow lately?"

Gretel nodded.

"What fellow was that?"

"The Seppel, seller, who was measured by Enk today with his head and arm!"

"So that Seppl is rebellious, he's following you?"

"Yes, that's how it is!"

"Are you alone in the bedroom?"

"The stable wench is still inside at night!"

"And she didn't hear anything either?"

"No!"

"Didn't find anything that Seppl left in the bedroom?"

"You think so! He forgot a red handkerchief!”

Now the experienced judge knew exactly what had happened, which he told the prostitute: “Seppel, who was rejected, wanted to take revenge on you! He eats tonight with a red-cloaked lantern[1] crept into the chamber and you whores were fast asleep. As a mockery and mockery, Seppel put the straw wreath that you found when you woke up on your head.”

"Sall is right! I beg you, sir, don't tell anyone else, the shame is too great!” begged the wench imploringly.

"All right! You didn't notice anything about the break-in?"

"Nothing, sir!"

The interrogation of the stable wench only confirmed that the straw wreath had been found. There is no trace of the burglar himself. The investigation and the record were closed and the court commission left the Hemmernmooshof and its owner, who lamented loudly for his lost money.

In his bare office in the small courthouse of the mountain town, poorly furnished with the most necessary equipment such as a table, chair, small laundry service and file stand, District Judge Ehrenstraßer carefully prepared the excavated tracks that had since dried up, but the nails and shoe-shoulder impressions were clear demonstrate. They are incorporated into the act, which must now rest until famous chance plays its longed-for part. The judge was already about to incorporate the act into the rubrum "Letter A" when Ehrenstraßer remembered not to let the matter rest with today's almost fruitless investigation. The usher Perathoner, a plump little man whose corpulence stood in stark contrast to his meager salary, received orders

In the meantime, Ehrenstrasser was completing a cito act in his calm, conscientious manner. It is so quiet in the bare, badly whitewashed room that the only sound is the scribbling of the pen on the rather rough file and the buzzing of a few freedom-craving flies at the closed, curtainless windows.

Completely immersed in his work, the judge ignored the soft knocking and the unlatching of the door lock. Only when a silvery girl's voice called: "Dear Papa!" Ehrenstrasser lifted his head and looked up.

"Ah, my darling! Come in, Emmy! What brings you to me in tenure?”

Embarrassed, blushing sweetly, the twenty-year-old blond daughter from her first marriage stands in front of her father, she looks pretty and bears an unmistakable resemblance to her father in the shape of her head and eyes. Because of the slight rebuke that Emmy immediately felt in Dad's question, the daughter asked her to kindly excuse the intrusion into the office during the term of office.

"It's okay Emmy! You know that during office hours I am exclusively involved in my profession and want to avoid disruptions in private matters. Your visit must therefore be based on a special event! Speak, my child: what brings you here?”

Ehrenstrasser had got up and stepped closer to his daughter, who suddenly spread her arms, threw her arms around her surprised father and began to cry on his chest.

"Emmy kid! What's that supposed to mean?"

The daughter sobbed through tears: "Forgive me, dear papa! Let me weep on your faithful father's breast!"

"For God's sake! What moves you so much? What happened?"

The girl shook and cried violently without answering.

Inquiringly, the judge directed his sharp eyes at the daughter, whose behavior seemed completely incomprehensible to him.

"Has there been trouble at home, Emmy?"

The daughter shook her blond head.

"Did someone step too close to you? I can't believe that given the quiet conditions in our little town. Speak, my child! And don't forget: I have a duty to work here! Speak!”

"I can't, dear papa!" Emmy stammered."Oh, women! Contradiction upon contradiction! You come to my office in a state that borders on bewilderment, looking for a conversation with your father and now you can and should talk, it says: I can't talk! Whoever wants to understand that; I do not get it!"

"Forgive me, good, dear papa!"

The judge was taken aback and repeated the words: "Forgive me, good, dear papa! That sounds a bit suspicious! Is something not in the daily routine in the heart room, isn't it?"

In great confusion, while hugging her again, Emmy whispered to her father, "Forgive me sweet papa! It's not my fault — Franz!"

Now Ehrenstrasser broke the embrace and spoke seriously: "What do I have to hear? Who eats Franz? How does my angelic daughter get a Franz? Who is this? what has happened I don't want to hope——”

Emmy shouted defensively: "No, no, dear papa, how can you think! I know my duty! But -"

"But what?"

Confused, Emmy stammered: "Franz, the son of the cement manufacturer Ratschiller, accompanied me on the usual walk and gave me -"

"So?"

“..... asked me to be his wife! Forgive me, dear papa!”

"So? That's the very latest! And the young man doesn't seem to know who to consult first about such matters?"

Blushing, Emmy lisped, "Sorry, Dad! Franz wanted to know my opinion first, he will then come to you to ask for your blessing!"

"Oh, the thousand! So perfectum est! I have to say: I wouldn't have believed my gentle Emmy capable of such independence! So you just said yes to the cement man?”

"No, dear papa! I just said Franz should ask for your blessing!”

"Oh, you dear country simpleton!" laughed the judge.

"Please, please, dear darling, don't be angry and give us your consent!" pleaded the daughter in lovely confusion.

"Adagio, lento tempo, child! An old lawyer doesn't rush into anything! And in tempo furioso there is no marriage. The old, golden jurist saying: "Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxilius, cur quomodo, quando" also applies in this case!"

"Dad, I don't understand a word of the learned stuff!"

Ehrenstrasser smiled. "I like to think so! But enough of the surprising thing! Go home Emmy, we'll talk about it!"

"Please, sweetheart, there you go!" flattered the girl.

"Don't push, kid! I hear voices in the waiting room, the sergeant quoted will come! Leave me now, child, duty calls me! Farewell, Emmy!”

The girl kissed Papa heartily and then whirled out the door.

"A nice gift! But Emmy is a good child, because she ran away from the recruiter to her father! Actually quite natural, I'm the only one and closest to her, hm, I might have been the only one!” the judge murmured and then rang the bell.

"Order, Mr. District Judge?" asked the entering servant.

"Is the sergeant here? Shall enter!”

"Your command, District Judge!" called Perathoner and pushed his spherical shape out into the antechamber.

Immediately afterwards the burly gendarmerie sergeant, who was probably in uniform but wore only the bayonet and the usual service cap instead of the plumed hat, came in with a salute and stood at attention in front of the judge in a military manner. "Order Mr. District Judge?"

"My dear sergeant! You will have already learned from the gendarme who was on duty at the Amareller today that we didn't have much success. I don't want to let the act slumber now, perhaps the gendarmerie can occasionally make a valuable observation. I would therefore like to inform you that, according to the finding of the broken chest in the Hemmernmooshof, the tool used was very probably a screwdriver with a broken corner. During requisitions, visits and other patrols, you and your subordinates should look out for similarly designed tools and report them to me immediately.”

"Very well! Do you have any other orders for me, Mr. District Judge?”

"No! Thank you!"

With a military salute, the sergeant resigned. The judge wanted to continue devoting himself to his work, but his thoughts about the engagement, which had come as a surprise, never stopped him. Thus Ehrenstrasser tormented himself to finish an act for the Expedit and finally he put down his pen and went home.

II.
Quite at the end of the town, in a kind of villa district, was the house where the judge had rented years ago because there weren't enough rooms in the office building for an official apartment. Immediately after the wedding, Ehrenstrasser's second wife had protested vigorously against such a small apartment. Besides, as she said, she didn't want to live under the same roof with convicts and inquisitors, and furthermore, one couldn't know how big the family would grow. This last remark had made the judge, who was otherwise so serious, laugh, it was the deciding factor, the large apartment at the end of town was rented and after a few years two girls from a second marriage lived in the house, which the surrounding residents had good reason to call the “Jewish school”. used.

Mrs. Bianca Ehrenstraßer came from a family of wine merchants in South Tyrol and showed the Ampezzo type in her outward appearance. Initially a fine figure with a Mediterranean temperament, coal-black eyes and blue-black hair, the judge developed over the years into a corpulent woman who, despite living constantly in purely German districts, was at loggerheads with the German language and retained the Welsh way of life. One consequence of this was a constant change of servants, which made life miserable for the husband and which provided the residents of the official town with something to talk about year in and year out. It is said that a servant placement office in Innsbruck alone is not able to cover the need for servants at district judges, because there is a change every month,

In the afternoon, at the hour when the district judge was leaving the chancellery, Frau Ehrenstrasser was reading an Italian novel and had become so engrossed in it that she failed to hear cook Cenzi, a plump woman from Unterinnthal, who had come into the living room to address her. Cenzi repeated the question: "I beg you, woman, what should you cook for dinner?"

Ms. Bianca straightened up with signs of indignation and yelled: "Come? What are the manners? I sono a gracious lady, a perfetta, real gracious lady! You have to say 'mama' to me, capisca?!"

Cenzi bowed his head humbly and then spoke: "Ma'am, please, what should I prepare for the evening?"

"It's the cuciniera's stuff, I don't have time!"

The girl stood helplessly before her mistress; only fourteen days in the house and not quite familiar with the art of cooking, Cenzi doesn't know how to find her way around, especially since she doesn't understand the language of the lady.

"Bring burro fresco con pane bianco! Children want snacks!”

Shaking her head, the girl walked away, determined to quit the next first.

A few moments later, the daughters of the second marriage, girls of the Welsh type aged six and five, stormed into the living room at a furious pace and began circling the dining table, the children screaming madly for burro fresco (fresh butter) and white bread .In vain Mrs. Bianca commanded such a lot of noise, the girls didn't bother in the least about the tace and kept up the noise. Mama pulled the bell, but when none of the servants came, she ordered Lina to tell the nanny to bring the snack.

Lena jumped out, but soon came back to report in Italian that none of the servants could be found.

"What economy!" Mama yelled and stormed out. The girls took advantage of their mother's absence to overhaul the table drawer and look for food in the buffet. The honey bottle was jubilantly discovered and robbed of its contents, black bread was sprinkled with oil from the carafe and greedily eaten. Under mutual thrashing, it couldn't have been otherwise that there were broken pieces, the Huiliere lies in ruins on the floor and what is left of it spreads out into a magnificent oval on the carpet, honey spatters cover the table and chairs. The younger daughter climbed up on a chair to get to the jam in the upper cupboard of the buffet, but her little hands couldn't reach it. The glass fell over with a clatter, taking others with it, and the jam smashed open on the floor below.

"Subito!" yelled the rascals of girls and began to soak up the sweet content by sitting down on the floor and gently leading the jam to their mouths with their fingers. In this delightful situation, Mrs. Bianca met her offspring, and the surprise was so great that the judge dropped the butter dish in terror.

The girls took advantage of the momentary confusion to rush to safety on the outside; Bianca stood alone in front of the Christmas tree, stunned for the moment, but she immediately found her voice again when Mr. Ehrenstraßer entered and wished his wife a "good evening" in his calm way.

A torrent of words spilled over the judge, who looked at the pile of broken pieces in amazement and couldn't help but smile mockingly. "A nice gift that! The girls do it colorful!“

Frau Ehrenstrasser immediately took her children under her protection; The servants and Emmy are to blame for the scandalous conditions in the house, because she hardly ever takes care of the house according to law and duty.

A serious look met the wife and the reply sounded just as serious. "As a wife and mother, the household chores and running the household are your business! And Emmy may be your stepdaughter, not your maid! I hope you will remember that! Besides, Emmy must have been in the house for the longest time!”

"Come?" called the wife in surprise.

"Emmy was in my office at a very unusual time today and confessed that the son of the cement manufacturer Ratschiller had asked her for her hand!"

"What news! And what did you say, carissimo?”

"The matter must first be examined and considered!"

"Ha! His Emmy is so sposa felice, congratulations! I want to wish the bride luck soon!” With the fire of her southern temperament, Mrs. Bianca wanted to go and see her stepdaughter, who lives in a room on the upper floor.

But the judge held the wife back. "Don't rush, love! We haven't gotten that far yet." — Ehrenstrasser paused, he didn't want to say that he was not particularly pleased with his wife's great joy at Emmy's departure from the house.

But Mrs. Bianca was hooked on the marriage project and broke free.

"Stay! And make sure that the presents are taken away! One would have to be ashamed if a visitor saw this inn!”

“Should clean up domestics! I have to see Emmy!” And the wife swept away.

With a sigh, Herr Ehrenstrasser went to his room, which is his tusk in the otherwise noisy house, where he can devote himself to studying his subject relatively undisturbed in the few free hours he has left. This time the industrious man was only to be granted half an hour's rest, for the girls soon found out that Mama was staying with Emmy upstairs, and immediately a war game was staged, the noise of which could be heard from across the house.

The kind-hearted father put down the legal literature with a sigh and went into the hallway to the scene of the Women's War to order silence.

In the most comical gibberish, the girls explained that they were only playing an Indian game and Papa shouldn't disturb them.

"Children, shut up! The noise is too big! Girls are supposed to play quietly at all. Take your dolls! Indian games are only played by wild boys!”

"We're also Bubi! Juih!” the rascals roared and fought madly.

"Lord of my life! It can not go on like this! Calm down, children! Or it delivers blows!”

"Papa us nit slag!" laughed the girls and whirled down the stairs to continue playing in the garden.

"A hopeless economy!" sighed Ehrenstrasser and retired to his room.

Annoyed, Mrs. Bianca came down from Emmy. The stepdaughter politely but coolly accepted the stormy congratulations on the engagement and thanked her for it with the caveat that Papa had not yet given his approval, so the matter was not yet ready for a decision. All further requests for information, where the couple met and fell in love, met Emmy's silence and finally asked that she want to waive the answer. So the stepmother saw her curiosity as unsatisfied and hurt, she changed the strings by asking Emmy in a sharp tone to kindly put things in order downstairs in the living room.

"I'll be right there!" Emmy replied when Frau Ehrenstrasser left her room, resentfully.

"Sangue della Madonna!" cried the judge when she reached the bottom and clenched her fists when she saw not one of her ministering spirits, and stormed from room to room until a bell called her to the corridor door.

"Sangue di Dio! What lovely visit! Compliments! Prego, come in, casa mia are at your service!” the poetess greeted the visitor, Frau Rosa von Bauerntanz, the wife of the district doctor, a pretty, blond figure who, of course, could hardly show off under an old-fashioned toilet.

The visitor was escorted into the sitting-room with lively protestations of joy; Mrs. Ehrenstrasser was shocked when she saw that the presents had not yet been removed, but she immediately made up an excuse, telling the visitor that the presents were the result of an event that had happened very suddenly.

"An event!? Oh, tell me, dearest Mrs von Ehrenstrasser!” exclaimed the doctor's wife with great curiosity.

"Yes, great event! Momento grande! Emmy be sposa felice!”

"What is she?"

"Sposa, bride!"
