In the beautiful sea-city of Genoa, nicknamed the proud, about the year 1435 a boy was born, now known in all lands as Christopher Columbus. The exact year of his birth is unknown. He was the son of lowly men, and his father, being a solid and industrious man, and a wool comber by trade, had to work hard to support his family.

The port of Genoa was full of ships from all the commercial ports of the then known world. The wharfs teemed with sailors, speaking all kinds of languages ​​and wearing the most diverse costumes. The lad was naturally thoughtful and, with a great love of adventures, possessed a vivid imagination. As he thus sauntered along the streets and looked at the great ships, a strong desire awoke in him to visit distant lands.

His father had four children, three sons and one daughter. He must have been a deserving and sensible man, for he seems to have given to all his children the education which the ordinary school afforded. Christopher had learned to read, write, and calculate well. He had also made some progress in Latin and drawing. He even attended the university of applied sciences at Pavia, where he diligently practiced geometry, geography, astronomy and nautical science.

He was only fourteen years old when his father entrusted him to the care of a kinsman whose name was Colombo, and with whom he made his first sea voyage. This experienced sailor was already very famous for his prowess in the[ 4 ]nautical science. In the Genoese fleet he held the rank of admiral and commanded a squadron.

The seas were then made so unsafe by pirates that every merchant ship had to be well armed to be ready for combat at once. Though we do not know what Columbus experienced on his first sea voyage, it is known that she was a war voyage. Colombo, commander of a squadron, sailed out of Genoa to rush to the aid of King René, who was trying to recapture his empire. This happened in 1459. The war lasted four years. Colombo's squadron was highly praised for its intrepidity.

Later, Christopher Columbus, in a letter to Ferdinand and Isabella, gave a brief account of a journey he had made to drive a galley out of the harbor of Tunis. His crew had by chance learned that the galley was being protected by two other ships, and had become so frightened that it refused to continue the journey. Apparently Columbus granted their wishes, and they believed that he had decided to return in order to fetch reinforcements. He changed course, however, and pulled up all the sails. Soon night fell. When morning came the ship sailed into the harbor where the galley lay.

The outcome is unknown, but the incident vividly reminds us of the still more important stratagem to which he later resorted to inciting his despondent sailors to continue the journey across the tumultuous sea to the new world. At that time, the Atlantic Ocean was virtually unnavigable. A few enterprising sailors had sailed along the coasts of northern Europe, and headed south to the west coast of Africa. But world trade was confined chiefly to the Mediterranean. Those were days of brutal violence, lawlessness and crime.

Every merchant ship was obliged to carry arms. Corsairs, whose ships often formed whole fleets, made all the seas unsafe. Every sailor must be a soldier, always ready to take up arms and repel an attacking foe. Columbus was formed under such circumstances. We know nothing of his earliest sea voyages, and we only know that he traversed much of the then known world. Thus he visited England, among other places, and plowed his prosperous keel the waters of the North Sea until he reached the northern shores of Iceland. It's not [ 5 ]improbable that he heard there loose rumors of the forays which, ages before, the Normans had made to the ice-bound coasts of Labrador and Greenland, and of the endless coasts further south, the vastness of which no one can imagine. could. Later in one of his letters he wrote:

"For forty years I have endeavored to discover the secrets of nature, and where ever a ship appeared, there I have been."

During his wanderings he finally arrived at Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, then one of the most famous seaports in the world. He was then 35 years old.

Columbus in his study.

From the biography written by his son we learn that he studied diligently. He read the works of Aristotle, Seneca and Strabo. Many a midnight hour was spent reading the inquiries made by Marco Polo and Sir John Maundevile of Mandeville. He pondered earnestly the questions to which these discoveries gave rise. But the book that most captivated him and completely occupied his mind was Cardinal Aliaco's World Description, the "Cosmography." It was a strange mixture of folly and learning, of real science and foolish fables.[ 6 ]

Columbus found many sailors at Lisbon, sensible, observant men, who had sailed all known seas. He heard them speak of driftwood, which had been found, and was very distinct from the vegetation known in Europe. Rough carvings had been fished from the sea, apparently worked with very imperfect tools. And, what seemed strangest of all, two corpses had washed up in the Azores, of a human race, such as was found neither in Europe nor in Africa.

Gradually the idea seems to have arisen in Columbus that there must be other and vast lands on the globe, which Europeans did not yet know. For only a small part of our earth was then visited by civilized people. When Columbus sat alone in his room, and his eyes rested on the wretched maps of the time, his mind awoke and, pencil in hand, he drew the well-known shores of the Mediterranean, as well as the lesser-known coasts of Africa from cape Blanco to cape Vert. In his imagination he boldly went up the Atlantic as far as the Azores, but here he found a terminal, because everything else was still unknown and unexplored.

The plan he had contemplated sent his blood to his cheeks. What lies, he wondered, in that vast, boundless ocean beyond? Is the earth a flat plane? Supposing this be so, but where is the end, and what lies beyond? Is the earth a sphere? If she is, how big is that sphere? Are there other lands in this vast ocean? Would it be possible for an intrepid adventurer to sail that globe?

In 1477 Columbus set out to find the west along the old north road that ran past Iceland. He had probably heard of the discoveries made in this direction by the Normans, and was aware that the distance from Europe's northernmost points to the Asian beaches was not considered great.

Before undertaking the great undertaking, he first made several small sea voyages. Southwards he visited Madeira, the Canary Islands and the coast of Guinea. He diligently traced the roads followed by the Portuguese navigators, and familiarized himself with all that they had discovered of the Azores and the westernmost islands.[ 7 ]

He also sought the north road, and even ventured some distance west of Iceland. Perhaps he had read the story of the Normans of Greenland, Markland, and Vineland. The last ship had returned from Greenland to Iceland about a hundred years before Columbus visited this island. Malte Brun supposes that Columbus learned of the exploits of these brave sailors in Italy, for Rome was then regarded as the center of the world, and whoever wanted to hear something important had to be there.

A Danish writer believes that Columbus, trying to obtain all kinds of books and manuscripts to read tales of sea voyages and discoveries, had obtained the writings of the noted historian Adam van Bremen, in which the discovery of Vineland was emphatically mentioned. .

These suspicions no doubt prompted him to travel to Iceland, and, according to the account of his son Fernando, he not only spent some time in Iceland, but sailed for another 300 miles, which must have enabled him almost to see Greenland .

Had Columbus been acquainted with the most important discoveries of the Normans, his firm belief in the possibility of finding a western land again, and his great zeal to do so, can easily be explained. We may safely regard his later discovery of America as the continuation of what the ancient Scandinavians did.

Columbus checked how much time it took for the sun to get from one side of the Mediterranean to the other, which distance is 2,000 miles. From this he deduced which space the sun could traverse in 24 hours. Such questions not only broadened his mind, but taught him to think rightly, and freed him from the evil influence of foolish fancies.

This exciting study demanded total dedication. He no longer thought of amusing himself, and the satisfaction of his ambition was likewise restricted. When he talked to his friends and acquaintances, the study was always the subject of the conversation. His study was sometimes full of sailors, who came to report what they had seen or even imagined.

Gradually, Columbus became convinced that the earth[ 8 ]should be convex, and that, therefore, sailing westward, one should reach the coasts of Asia. He had made a fairly accurate calculation of the size of the earth, by taking into account the speed with which the sun apparently moves. He did not suspect that there was land between Europe and Asia, but he believed that he would find the coasts of Asia, where he later found the New World.

Indefinite reports of the great island of Japan, which was to extend east of Asia, were circulating in Europe. Columbus believed that it lay where he later found Cuba.

“These great empires,” said Columbus, “are peopled with immortal beings, for whose redemption Christ made a bloody sacrifice. God has entrusted me with the task of seeking them, and of bringing them the gospel. The wealth of India is proverbial, and I shall find in it inexhaustible treasures with which to procure armies. With these armies we may redeem the grave of the Savior of the world from the hands of the unbelievers, who have no reverence for it.”

Columbus was poor. It was quite beyond his power to undertake such an important voyage of discovery. Most thought him a half-mad bigot. As foolish as one should find a proposal to visit the moon, so absurd was his plan thought. In vain did he knock on the doors of rich people. Yet he found sensible people who examined his plans, and judged them worthy of serious investigation. With the aid of such witnesses he hoped to secure the cooperation of some European courts. A mighty state could easily furnish him with the necessary means, and bestow upon him that authority and dignity which he had for the execution .thought he really needed his plans. In return the court would become rich and powerful, and would gain such fame that it was envied throughout Europe.

He first turned to the government in Portugal. King John II received him in a solemn audience, and listened attentively and apparently with interest to his plans. Columbus did not at all think of himself as one who humbly comes to beg something at the foot of a royal throne. Rather, he pretended to be one to whom God had made great revelations, which the riches and fame of the[ 9 ]greatest monarch would increase, and cause a new era to open up to the world. In return for all his merits he requested to be made viceroy over all the lands which he should discover, and for the tenth part of all the profits which it might bring.

While he was staying in Lisbon he became acquainted with an Italian young lady named Felipa, who lived with her widowed mother. Although she was of considerable birth, she had no fortune. Their marriage soon followed, and it seems to have been happy until death do them part. They had a son named Diego.

The king thought Columbus's demands excessive. This one was a poor, unknown sea captain, with no rank, money, or friends. And yet this strange, earnest man, with his impetuous enthusiasm, proposed to take his place in the ranks of kings. With a polite bow the prince let the ambitious sea captain depart from his auditorium.

The man's dignified and earnest demeanor, and the complete confidence which he manifested in the correctness of his views, had, however, made a deep impression on the king. He could not shake the thoughts that had been communicated to him. After pondering the matter for some time, he convened a council of the most learned men at Lisbon, and presented the matter to him. Everything was carefully considered. Some of the most eminent members of that council spoke favorably of Columbus' plans. But the majority ruling was decidedly against it. It was reported to the king that his plans were so absurd that they were to be called unworthy of further discussion.

Yet the king was dissatisfied, for the impression he had obtained was too strong to be easily blotted out. Moreover, the fact that the greatest philosophers shared Columbus' views diminished the impression of the Report submitted. Then the king had the baseness of taking a most disgraceful measure. He secretly sent out a fleet. This one was called to go to the Cape Verde Islands. Using all the information Columbus had given him, he secretly ordered the captain to follow boldly the trail Columbus had set, hoping in this way to become the discoverer himself. The captain obeyed the orders, but his sailors lost heart,[ 10 ]for they knew not whither they were going on those unknown waters.

A terrible storm broke upon the ocean, pushing their fears to the limit. In a loud voice all declared that they refused to face such dangers, so that the captain was obliged to yield and turn back.

Columbus became aware of this shameful conduct, which had greatly provoked his indignation. With his wrath mingled emotions of disappointment and sadness that the royal court, which he had been accustomed to look upon with reverence, had treated him so treacherously.

He was then a widower, and had only his son Diego. Devoting his time to the study and furthering of his plans of discovery, he had no opportunity to look after his financial interests. He made his humble living by making and selling cards. He then moved with Diego to Genoa, his birthplace. Here he had to experience the truth of the proverb, that a prophet is not honored in his own country.

He asked the City Council for help in an undertaking which was generally not only called fatal, but which the scholars at Lisbon had already said was worthy of no attention.

“And who is that Christopher Columbus?” was asked. "Well, he's a sailor from our town," was the reply; “the son of Dominico Colombo, a wool comber. He has two brothers and a sister who reside here in humble circumstances.”

This put an end to the case at the proud Genoese court. Columbus' request was rejected with contempt. He couldn't even get a proper hearing. Now he was poor, and only hope and an innate spirit should sustain him. At last, after many more plans, he decided to try his luck at the Spanish court.

He took his son Diego with him, embarked at Genoa, and after a short voyage landed at Palos, a small Spanish seaport at the mouth of the Tinto. Ferdinand and Isabella were just at war with the Moors at the time. Both were then with their army at Cordova, nearly a hundred miles north-east of Palos. There all their effort [ 11 ][ 12 ]was necessary for the conduct of the war, the moment might turn out to be inauspicious to try to persuade them into an undertaking which would cost a great deal of money and, moreover, be doubtful.

With a light purse and a heavy heart, Columbus set out to cover the many miles that separated him from the royal encampment. He was pale, thin, and it could be seen that care had consumed him. His clothes were bare. He didn't have to carry suitcases and bags; only he carried a small package by his side. Little Diego walked with his father's hand.

They were only a mile and a half from the village of Palos when they came to a solid stone monastery. Diego was hungry and thirsty, so the father went to the monastery to ask for a cup of water and a slice of bread for his child.

Quite by accident the prior of the monastery knocked on the door at that moment. The stranger's polite request, dignified demeanor, and sensible features impressed him deeply. He bade Columbus enter,[ 13 ]struck up a conversation with him, and not only took a great interest in the new plans which he put forward, but was quite convinced by the force of his reasoning that there was truth in them. He kept Columbus with him for a few days, gave him all the hospitality the monastery could afford, and invited him to visit with him a nearby physician who excelled in science.

Columbus, the prior and the doctor, spent many hours in the cells of the silent monastery of La Rabida, wondering whether the earth was a sphere or a flat plane, and whether it would be possible, by sailing ever west, to reach the mainland of to reach Asia, which lay far away in the East.

The prior of the monastery was a learned man, and of great influence at court, being, as was often the case in those days, of a high rank. He showed such keen interest in Columbus and his enterprise that he persuaded him to leave his son Diego in the convent to be educated, and gave him letters of commendation for Queen Isabella's confessor.

Through this visit, and through all that had been done for his child, Columbus continued the journey to Cordova in a merry and cheerful spirit.

The military display that Columbus saw in the camp at Cordova was astonishing. The splendor of the court of Castile and that of the court of Arragon were united there. The whole knighthood of Spain was gathered in that great field, and splendidly attired with splendid armor and fine retinue. The tents stood in a circle, and it was as if one saw a great city. Shining weapons and waving plumes were everywhere, while the music of the military troops filled the air.

But all this splendor was nothing to Columbus compared to the plans, which filled his mind. He gave his letter to Fernando Talavera, the Queen's chaplain. Talavera was a proud prelate, cool and inarticulate. Barely received Columbus politely, listened with apparent disgust to the story of the plan which he came to propose, and let him go, saying:

"I think it would be most urgent now, when Her Majesty is weighed down by all the cares of this campaign, to come to her with a plan hanging in the air."

The appearance of Columbus was anything but impressive. His clothes looked shabby and bare, and he was[ 14 ]dejected by disappointment. But the rumor of his plans spread like wildfire through the camp. The courtiers pointed mockingly at the bald adventurer as one who possessed immeasurable empires with millions of inhabitants, which he intended to give as a present to the kings of Spain.

Columbus didn't know what to do or where to go. He lingered at Cordova while the Spanish army advanced to attack the last hideout of the Moors in the province of Granada. He kept himself convinced that victory would follow the royal banners, and that there might then be an opportunity to make his request. In the autumn Ferdinand and Isabella returned in triumph. They established their court for the winter at Salamanca, nearly 300 miles from Cordova. In the meantime Columbus, who could not get an audience with the queen, found a frugal subsistence in drawing maps and plans.

The scenes then enacted at Cordova and its environs had enticed the most famous men from all parts of Spain thither. This afforded Columbus an opportunity to come into contact with the most learned men. Astute persons received a deep impression of the dignity with which he behaved, of the depth of his conviction, of his extensive knowledge, and of the captivating eloquence with which he advocated his opinions. Sometimes he had the pleasure of gaining the approval of someone.

A wise and wealthy gentleman became so interested in Columbus that he invited him to come and be his guest. This gentleman introduced him to the pope's nuncius, Antonio Geraldini, and to other gentlemen who held high positions in the state or at court.

While he was thus wasting his time at Cordova in useless delay, he associated himself with a lady of that place. Her name was Beatrix Enriquez and she was of nobility, but not rich. She became the mother of his second son, Fernando, who was born the following year, 1487, and who, after his death, wrote his life history.

Columbus followed the court to Salamanca. Here he was introduced to the Archbishop of Toledo, the Grand Cardinal of Spain. This famous prelate had such influence with the king and queen that he was called the third king. More and more he became so convinced of the strength of the evidence with which Columbus defended his plans, that he[ 15 ][ 16 ]consented to bring him into the royal presence.

Columbus lays out his plan.

Columbus lays out his plan.

He was probably first admitted to Ferdinand. Columbus could not be shaken by the royal splendor, and with great eloquence he recommended his cause. The king was a cunning, shrewd man, not easily brought under the influence of romantic dreams. He listened with philosophical coolness to the excited litigator.

The king's ambition was strongly stimulated by the idea of ​​the greatness which would become Spain's share if one succeeded in making discoveries and in making considerable profits. Then Spain would have a preponderance over all nations. But Ferdinand was very anxious and slow to decide. He convened a council of the most learned men from Spain to have an interview with Columbus, to scrutinize his plans, and to report to him their finding.

The meeting took place in the Dominican monastery of St. Stephanus, in Salamanca. The assembly, convened by royal order, was impressive because of the considerable number of members. It consisted of professors, the highest dignitaries in the church, and statesmen of the first rank. Any ordinary person would have dreaded appearing before such a host of the most learned astronomers and world describers. Columbus was glad to have an opportunity to present his plans, of the soundness of which he was convinced, to men of science, who, he doubted, would give him their approval.

But soon he found, to his great sorrow, that even in the minds of the most learned men, prejudice and superstition over the power of reason may prevail. The philosophers, as well as the clergy, brought evidence against him which would now arouse the derision of even the simplest. The following words of Lactantius were quoted, because they triumphantly refuted Columbus' claim of the roundness of the earth.

“Would anyone be so foolish as to believe that there are antipodes, men who walk with their feet up and their heads down? That there is a part of the earth where everything is upside down; where the trees grow with the branches down, and where it rains, hails, and snows from the ground up? The idea that the earth would be round has the fable of the antipodes in the[ 17 ]brought into the world; for when these learned men once went astray, they proclaimed still more absurdities, defending one with another.”

Columbus' plans were thought to be unwise, and they were also considered to be contrary to the Scriptures. To maintain that people lived on the other side of the earth was said to detract from the credibility of the Bible. According to this book, all earthlings descended from Adam, so it was impossible that some could have traveled so far.

But if it was supposed, it was said, that the earth was round, and that a ship might come to the other side, yet it would never turn back, for there could be no wind strong enough to pass over those immense to bring back a large roundness.

Columbus answered these theologians and philosophies by contrasting them with truths with which even the most illiterate is acquainted today. Though the assembly gave an unfavorable report, there were many members who were much moved by the words of Columbus. Among these was Diego de Deza, later Archbishop of Seville. He supported the cause of Columbus, though in vain, as far as he could. The majority indicated that it was both untrue and heretical to assume that there would be land to be found if one sailed from Europe to the west. Such a report was made by a meeting of the most learned men only four hundred years ago.

Second Chapter.
First trip.
The disappointment at the outcome of the Assembly at Salamanca was bitter to Columbus. Yet the plan had become known through it, so that it was talked about all over Spain. While the hapless adventurer was exposed to all manner of ridicule, there were also many, men of reputation and great ability, who were convinced that his suspicion should not be answered with a grim smile.

While this important question was being discussed, Columbus was regarded as belonging to the legation at court. It was an age of great political movement.[ 18 ]All minds were filled with the tenacious war against the Moors, which was still going on. During the summer of 1487 the king and queen were with the army to wage the memorable siege of Malaga. Because of his great stature, Columbus could be seen everywhere, but also that he walked from tent to tent in thought, almost hopelessly, and whenever he could find a sympathetic ear, he would come forward with his request. There was something striking in the appearance of this great man, in simple garb, but at the same time with dignified demeanor, when, amid that military pomp, he moved in silence.

When Malaga surrendered in September, the court returned to Cordova. For eighteen months it went to and fro, as the great battle demanded it. Columbus shared in all those journeys of the court, still cherishing the hope, in which he was strengthened by some faithful friends, that one day he would find an audience at the court. Through the influence of these friends, in the spring of 1489, he received orders from Ferdinand to convene another assembly of scholars and clergy at Seville. Again he looked disappointed. The terrible battle ignited with new vigor. Terrible battles, to which were added insurrection, slaughter, and misery, resulted. All effort was necessary. To Columbus and his rash,

Thus passed a grueling year. During these sorrowful months Columbus sojourned at Cordova, fortunately at the expense of the court. When spring came in the land, Ferdinand and Isabella were busy making the necessary preparations for one of the greatest military undertakings, the siege of Granada. Before the court advanced Columbus made a desperate attempt to be heard, but he received the discouraging reply that the princes could not pay any heed to him before the end of the campaign. That blow was a great blow to Columbus, but it did not knock him down. It still could not drive his irrepressible spirit to despair. He sat down quietly and checked which aid he could now use.

People lived in a time of feudal power and prosperity. The Spanish mountains were dotted with the strong castles of dukes and barons. Columbus turned to the duke of[ 19 ]Medina Sidonia. This mighty lord, whose castle was an almost impregnable fortress, made entirely of iron and stone, belonged to the highest nobility in Europe. In the splendor of his court and way of life, he could rival kings. From his own means he supplied the princes with a whole army of horsemen, a hundred warships, and a large sum of money. The splendid undertaking which Columbus intended to undertake was for a time to the liking of the duke, but on reflection he dismissed the plan as a fanatic's dream.

It is said that Columbus then went to knock on the door of the Duke of Medina Celi. Here he was initially favorably received. The duke was about to equip three or four ships for the journey, but it occurred to him that the Spanish princes might find it wrong for him to undertake such a grand undertaking at his own expense. That's why he let Columbus go.

Seeing himself thus deceived, Columbus resolved to try his luck at the French court. He now had a number of influential and wealthy friends who would no doubt open their purses to his modest demands. Before crossing the Pyrenees on his long journey to the French capital, he first visited his son Diego at the monastery of La Rabida, near Palos. He made the journey on foot or on a mule. If his friends had already given him a little money, it is certain that he considered the greatest thrift necessary. He still had a long and costly journey to make, and it was still uncertain how he would be received at the proud court of the French king.

In a simple robe, covered with dust from the voyage, Columbus stood before the door of the monastery. But neither dust nor bare clothes could hide the man's innate dignity. He was a nobleman by nature, who, to justify his claims, had no need of the radiance of costly raiment. Since he first stood at the door of that monastery to ask for a drink for his child, seven years of sustained effort and disappointment had passed. These sorrows and efforts had curved his body and grayed his hair. His cheeks were wrinkled, which happens so lightly when one is disappointed and has to think heavily.

The dignified prior of the monastery received the weary adventurer with true brotherly kindness. He was whole [ 20 ]and already convinced that Columbus' plans were sensible, and deserved the immediate and earnest attention of the Spanish court. When he was certain that Columbus was thinking of a visit to France, his patriotism awoke, and he was very much afraid that Spain should lose the fame of the great undertaking. He immediately had the learned physician of whom we spoke before summoned, and informed him of his fear. Many other influential friends were also invited to confer with Columbus on that most momentous matter which the prior appeared to be so important to the fame of Spain.

Nearby lived a gentleman who was renowned for his family, his great wealth, and his acquaintance with naval affairs. This man's name was Martin Alonzo Pinzon, and his experience enabled him to appreciate the strength of the lands commanded by Columbus. He ardently embraced his cause, promising him not only monetary assistance, but his influence, to bring the cause once more before their majesties Ferdinand and Isabella. The prior of the monastery had been chaplain to the queen in earlier years. He wrote her an urgent letter, and claimed that Spain should not lose such a fine opportunity to rise above all countries.

In those days there were no postal wagons, nor the conveniences that the postal service now provides. The letter was entrusted to an old, decrepit sailor, and it was sent to Santa Fe, where the court then resided during the siege of Granada. The distance was about 150 miles. The messenger arrived well and good, and handed the letter to the queen.

Notwithstanding all the worries which then filled her mind, Isabella got a deep impression of it. She gave an encouraging reply, and strongly urged her dear friend, the prior of the convent, to come to her at once.

This reply immediately revived hope in the heart of Columbus, and brought great joy to the small circle at La Rabida. It was the middle of winter, and cold winds were blowing over the bare mountains and barren plains, also of southern Spain. But immediately the prior mounted the mule, and staggered along the lonely road to the court.

The reception which the Queen prepared for her former chaplain was cordial. Though she's withdrawn [ 21 ]and did not move, warm affection slumbered beneath that cool exterior. She listened with approval to the words of the prior. Being a learned man, and knowing his thoughts by intimate association with Columbus, he was the right man to present his plans in the clearest manner. The queen had hitherto paid no attention to the matter, for although the king and the assembly of scholars had been informed, she had never been addressed directly.

The reader will recall that Ferdinand was only king of Arragon. Isabella was queen of Castile, and had her own income, army and court. At once she decided to protect Columbus. She sent for him so that he could immediately go to Santé Fé. So called to carry out an order of the queen, she sent him a sufficient sum to buy a mule and suitable robes, to appear at court, and to meet his travel expenses.

When the prior returned to La Rabida with these pleasant tidings, there was great rejoicing there, and new hope shone in the weary soul of Columbus. A fine mule was bought, the traveler put on a neat suit, and soon, rejuvenated and merry with hope, trotted over the hills and through the shady valleys of fair Andalusia. He arrived at Granada in time enough to see the banners of the Moors ripped from the walls of the Alhambra, in order to replace them with the flags of Ferdinand and Isabella. It was the fairest moment in the reigns of the two famous kings, and was regarded as the most glorious of Spanish arms.

In the midst of all that commotion, Columbus made an appearance with Queen Isabella. He took the attitude, not of a humble supplicant, but of a God-sent envoy, who requited with great endowments the puny favors which enabled him to carry out his plans.
