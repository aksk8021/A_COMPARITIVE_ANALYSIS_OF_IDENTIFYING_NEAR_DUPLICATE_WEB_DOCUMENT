My dear Cousine,

The college students have returned to school, the bathers from Dieppe and the players from Baden-Baden have returned to Paris. The crowd begins to return to the theaters; the young magistrates with well-shaven chins round off their speeches at the start of the school year. The old hundred-sou piece, which was said to have gone to India, has returned to circulation. Charles Jud alone resists the training of this general return. As for me, I felt like an invincible temptation to resume our old chats, and here I am in the middle of the newspaper, between my friend Sauvestre and my friend Sarcey, surprised and happy to find myself in front of you and with them, but absolutely unable to say why or where I got back.

Why? Probably because a secret malaise brings us back to the newspaper as soon as we try to get away from it. It's a lack, a void, a weariness of doing nothing. We can create other occupations for ourselves; nothing replaces this periodic conversation with the crowd. Of all the artificial needs that man gives himself here below, the most imperious is the need to write on a fixed day.

Does this mean that our hands are always full of truths? Do we have in our hearts or in our imaginations a plethora of ideas and feelings which ask to be spread? Is it the hatred of this or the love of that which excites and torments us? Rarely. It is quite true that each of us has his affections and his antipathies; we would like to persuade something to those who read us; it would be pleasant for us to convert all men to justice and liberty. But we write above all for the pleasure of writing; we are selfish in good faith; the satisfaction of hearing ourselves preach is dearer to us than the salvation of our flock. It is said that the human species would be extinct in no time if nature had not taken care to attach pleasure to the acts of reproduction. Me

Look at the beginners, the conscripts of journalism; children who come out of college, or who have not even left it! Is it to enlighten their contemporaries that they dip their pen and their fingers in a writing desk? Hey! poor innocents! they have not yet learned to think. Is it a motive of private interest that excites them? But they are ruining themselves by publishing their prose in a few small newspapers without readers! Nothing discourages them; they go straight ahead without knowing the way, without seeing a goal on the horizon, carried away, uncertain, stumbling, falling, getting up and running even faster; drunk with the wine of youth! It is criticism that attracts them: they have been told in class that criticism is easy, and they believe it. With what heart do they attack the giants of politics and poetry! “Oh! you think you're stronger than us, because your name is Guizot, Hugo, Lamartine! Ah! Goliath, the shadow of your great body hides the sun from us! Wait till I get my slingshot!”

I remember the time when M. Scribe, a great dramatic poet, was the target of all apprentice journalists. M. Scribe is no more; but the targets are not lacking, and our young journalists do not leave the national shooting idle. They aim right, left, everywhere, at marble statues and plaster dolls. Happy age! One uses one's first newspaper as one's first gun. Have you ever met, my cousin, a boy of twelve who has just been given a gun for his New Year's Eve? He has gunpowder, he has lead, he has capsules; the universe is his! No human force can hold him back; he runs through the fields, the gardens, even the house: with his new rifle. He is intoxicated by the sound of explosions, the smell of gunpowder and the joy of destroying. He shoots the sparrows,

We've all been there, and that time of naïve absurdity isn't the one we regret the least. But there comes a time when you take a dislike to the newspaper. We realize that we have wasted a lot of time without profit and played the role of fools. We worked for ten years and wrote all sorts of pretty things of which nothing remains. Lively discussions, in-depth articles, scholarly varieties, soap operas full of salt, piquant entre-filets, ingenious paradoxes, everything has passed, everything has vanished, withered, melted; the work of ten years has left no more vestiges than the snows of yesteryear. If only we had made a fortune! But no: the newspaper sometimes feeds its man, it never enriches him. “So, we say to ourselves with deep melancholy, I have wasted the best of my life for the amusement of a few idlers! I founded several newspapers prosperity, and I am poor! I distributed the eulogy to a multitude of authors, actors, editors, directors who have hotels in Paris or castles in the countryside, and I tremble every three months before the term to be paid! I built reputations, no one reciprocated; I have made famous men, and I am only a famous man. However, all these people are my litigants and I am worth them. How many novels, how many comedies one could have made with the mind I spent! A vaudeville hardly takes more time than two soap operas, and brings in a hundred times more! Twenty newspaper articles are the material of a one-volume novel, and cost ten times as much work, because each article is a framework, a composition, a whole to be created! Why would I persist in a path that leads people to the hospital? Let's write novels! Let's go to the theatre.

There is a lot of truth in these complaints. Journalism is a thankless profession, except for the dishonest people who are in it, thank God! in a very large minority. Better to write a hundred times novels which are printed, reprinted and end up paying rents to the author. The theater has profits less certain, but sometimes enormous. Happy is he who, in the morning, on opening his eyes and the Entr'acte , sees that the actors of two or three theaters in Paris will be shouting at each other all evening trying to earn him money! He can come and go, visit the Cluny museum or the aquarium of the Jardin d'acclimatation, practice his weapons at Pons or exchange punches at Lecour, dine at the Maison d'oror in Peter's tavern; his interests are in a safe place. Two or three first-rate artists, Madame Viardot or Madame Plessy, Got or Paulin Ménier, Lafont or Geoffroy will take care of her business and mint coins in her effigy, between nine o'clock and midnight.

This is why journalists, after a few years of training, venture into the novel or the theater. I am not talking about those who enter the Stock Exchange: they have abdicated. But how is it that a widely read novelist, an acclaimed playwright, returns to his journal like the Savoyard to his mountain? Why do politicians who have arrived and become rich, like M. de Girardin or M. le doctor Véron, allow themselves to be brought back from time to time to the terrain of their combats and their miseries? It's because the most thankless professions and soils are those that leave us with the most endearing memories. Journalism has intoxicating bitters like coffee, opium and hashish. We taste it, we curse it, and we want to taste it again.

Doubtless it is foolish to expend one's mind from day to day, for the amusement of a few idle readers; but how sweet it is to serve the public his ideas all hot, like little pies coming out of the oven! A novel progresses slowly; it waits six months in the boxes of the bookshop. Printed, it disperses to the four cardinal points; France and abroad read it or do not read it, the critics like it or despise it; it is a question which is decided slowly and which is never well resolved, in this time of easy camaraderie and ferocious jealousy.

A comedy rises to the clouds or falls a hundred meters below the level of the ramp. But it sometimes takes years to achieve this happy or sad result; whereas the newspaper article, written at two o'clock, is printed at three, distributed at four, read at five! The author leaves his home, reaches the boulevard, and finds himself in the middle of a traveling areopagus which reads him and judges him, applauds him or hisses him. It's a cash success, if it's a success.

The action of the newspaper on people is immediate, almost overwhelming. Last Monday, for example, the Constitutionnel published two remarkable articles. One was from M. Sainte-Beuve, about M. Guizot; the other from M. Fiorentino, on Mademoiselle Nelly. M. Sainte-Beuve has pointed out, with the finesse of a writer of genius, certain weak sides of his illustrious colleague. Mr. Fiorentino celebrated, in lyrical style, the perfections of an out-of-line actress, who sings a pretty verse and straddles a beautiful horse in the fairyland of Le Pied de Mouton. Suppose that Tuesday evening M. Guizot met M. Sainte-Beuve and that a parallel chance brought Mademoiselle Nelly into the presence of M. Fiorentino. Do you believe that M. Guizot, of the French Academy, and Mademoiselle Nelly, of Porte-Saint-Martin, would have approached their respective critics from the same front? No, probably. M. Guizot would have grimaced, and Mademoiselle Nelly would have smiled with her thirty-two teeth. Because it is certain that the Constitutionalof last Monday placed Mademoiselle Nelly far above M. Guizot. If that was the intention of the honorable editor, he achieved his goal and put everyone in their place. He proved to the Orleans family that, if Louis-Philippe had had Mademoiselle Nelly as president of the cabinet, Mademoiselle Nelly would have mounted on February 24, 1848; which would have saved the constitutional monarchy.

The same day, an even more official sheet, which is read attentively by all the courts of Europe, told Mademoiselle Juliette Beau its fact. M. Gustave Claudin held the pen; a breath of rigid virtue and austere criticism circulated between the columns of the Moniteur . It was clearly proved to attentive Europe that the Comédie-Française had done well to reject our poor Juliette and to receive Mademoiselle Rose Deschamps. The effect of this judgment was not long in coming. Mademoiselle Juliette Beau redoubled her zeal and showed great talent that very evening in a thankless and badly done role.

So the newspaper is good. He doesn't always hit the nail on the head, okay. But he hits hard and fast. It is a vehicle for thought, it is a weapon for love, hate or revenge, a thunderbolt in the hands of man. We don't understand the American without a gun, the Arab without a horse, the Lapp without a sledge, the Frenchman without a newspaper.

Unfortunately, the press is a hobbled horse, a jammed sleigh, a misfiring gun. Ah! if the press were free! It would be good to write every day. One would even write at night; we would get up at four in the morning to write.

I'm not blaming the government; I pity. He thinks he is doing the right thing by tying our hands, which bothers us a great deal and hardly benefits him. But the principal author of our ills is neither the Emperor nor any of the ministers who succeeded one another during these ten years of reaction. So who is it to blame? To a freedom fanatic, to the greatest journalist of our century, M. Émile de Girardin. It was he who reduced us to slavery the day he invented the cheap newspaper.

Before him, subscribers quietly paid for the daily bread of their thoughts. A well-made newspaper costs sixty or eighty francs a year, depending on the quality of the paper, the print run, and the editing. One can even, at this price, pay the stamp duty, which is about two hundred per cent on the merchandise manufactured.

M. de Girardin ruined us all by a stroke of genius. He took it into his head to deliver his newspaper below cost, except to recover from the advertisements. Suppose a daily newspaper which loses four hundred thousand francs on the subscription and leases its advertisements at the price of five hundred thousand: it will earn a hundred thousand francs a year, and will be worth more than a million. At this price, the founder grows rich, the editors earn their living, the public subscribes for forty francs, the business profits cheaply from enormous publicity. But freedom of the press is dead.

The government no longer needs to issue restrictive laws; lawsuits, warnings, press releases become almost useless. All it takes is an office manager who frowns once in a while. The newspaper will be afraid, because it represents a million. And capitals are more fearful than men, if that is possible.

Did Armand Carrel understand this danger? If so, he was truly a martyr of press freedom.

A truly free newspaper is one whose only capital is the intelligence and courage of its editors. But how to do it? If five or six young people join together to found a new National , they will necessarily have to lose on the subscription like everyone else. The advertisements will come to their aid, for sure, when they have reached a circulation of fifteen thousand copies. But then they will have lost three or four hundred thousand francs, barring a miracle. They will be the slaves of a capital, that is to say of one or more capitalists. And these impulses of generous madness which push a people forward, will be forbidden to them forever.We write, however, and we pull on our chain, as if it were in our power to lengthen it. If the indulgence or inadvertence of all those who watch us allow us to speak a little word of truth, we think it is so much taken from the enemy. The public that reads us blames this timidity and accuses us of sparing the goat and the cabbage. Parbleu! gentlemen, I would like to see you in our place! Everything that reigns, governs, administers, governs or functions at any level of the social scale, is afraid of the printed paper. It is not only about Paris, but about the departments. The Public Health of Lyon, the Girondeof Bordeaux and five or six other provincial sheets, which are equal to those of Paris, will tell you the news. It's not that the established men always hate the language of truth; but they don't like to hear it in the street.

A friend of mine, who directs a large newspaper in the department of Seine-et-Garonne , reports to his prefect some great administrative horror; he is summoned quickly, quickly, before the little king of the department.

“Sir,” they said to him, “when facts of this kind come to your knowledge, I authorize you to bring them to me here in my cabinet; I forbid you to speak of it to the public!

Another, who honorably does his job as a journalist in the Côtes-de-l'Est , is not afraid to give excellent advice to a large financial company.

"Monsieur," said the governor or regent of the affair, "by what right do you wash my dirty linen in public?" When you have an opinion to give me, it would be very easy to come to me!

It remains to be seen whether the cabinet of these gentlemen opens up to advisers who are not journalists!

An actress from Paris (these ladies are sometimes the understudy of the highest civil servants) said to a critic of my friends:

“I'm going to play a difficult role among all. If I fail, tell me at home. But I forbid you with your life to breathe a word of it to the public.

What would you think, cousin, of a defendant from the Assize Court who said to the Attorney General:

“If the witnesses tell you facts against me, I allow you to come and submit them to me at Mazas; but, for God! don't say anything about it in front of the jury!

The jury in any case is the public. The accused is any man in office who is suspected of abusing power, simply because he holds it. As for us, poor journalists, we are neither magistrates, nor clerks, nor even bailiffs. We are nothing, we ask for nothing, we aim for nothing; the pleasure of writing is the clearest of our income. And yet our misery is so sweet that we do not aspire to change state, and we prefer to all official embroideries the modest spangles which light up our obscurity.

II
THE TYRANNELS OF THE PROVINCE
The letter I wrote to you a few weeks ago on municipal liberties [1] has produced, my dear cousin, curious effects. I kinda suspected that Gottlieb's misadventures weren't unique, that France had more than one Sauerkraut mayor and more than one Ignacius sub-prefect ; but I would never have believed that the number was so great.

[1] See Letters of a Good Young Man , page 353.

Poor Eugène Guinot had fourteen things on his hands one day for having said that a Mr. X… had found a Mr. Z… in his wife's closet. Four husbands had recognized themselves in the person of the unfortunate X…; ten young people, all handsome, all well made, all boiling with the noblest courage, claimed the victorious initial of Z... The honest and benevolent chronicler in vain alleged that the anecdote was pure invention: he had specified the day and the hour of the event, and it was proved to her that, on the same day, at the same hour, in that happy country of France, fourteen husbands had opened fourteen cupboards furnished with fourteen lovers.

We sought a quarrel with Gavarni on an even more singular occasion. The great artist had drawn two individuals seated face to face in front of a tavern table, with this caption:

"Do you see that gentleman walking in there?

-Yes.

"Do you know what it is?"

-No.

-It's not important."

The third character, the little thing in question, was represented neither from the front, nor from the side, nor even from behind. He shone only by his absence. And yet there was in Paris a man sensitive enough to recognize himself in this absent figure and to demand reason from the painter who had not drawn it!

My case is quite different, dear cousin. No mayor, no sub-prefect has recognized himself in the portraits I have drawn; but here are entire communes congratulating me for having castigated their mayor; here are the districts that thank me for having told the truth about their sub-prefect.

First of all, I received a letter signed by a very decent name, and dated X…, department of… Here it is:

"Sir,

“I am Gottlieb. All my fellow citizens of the city of X… are so many Gottliebs… It is our mayor whom you painted in the natural under the name of Jean Sauerkraut . How is it that you know us so well without ever having been to our house?

“Come quickly, sir. The grateful people will receive you with open arms. The day when it pleases you to hear our grievances and to judge with your own eyes the injustices of our tyrants, I hope that you will do me the honor of staying at my house, at the Écu de France . My prices are infinitely more moderate than those of the Soleil d'or , and my table d'hote is better served, if we are to believe MM. commercial travellers.

“Accept, etc.”I was about to reply: “Sir, you do me too much honor. My friend Gottlieb, who is not a symbolic character, has never set foot in your department. But a very amiable young lawyer, whom I had known intimately in an Eastern town, was introduced to my home.

“My dear friend,” he said to me as he entered, “I almost had myself announced to you under the name of Gottlieb junior. My father lived since his birth in the chief town that you know. For some twenty years he fulfilled modest but honorable functions there, which were sufficient for his ambition. Unfortunately, his fellow citizens, who esteemed him, elected him vice-president of a charitable society: there was a legitimist competitor. This appointment, which my father had not even requested, caused a stir. Our enemies have moved. A senior official, who should have declared himself for us [2], set out for Paris; a few days later, my poor father was assigned to another residence. Here he is exiled from his native town, separated from his friends, away from his properties, disturbed in all his habits, at an age when man no longer knows how to change. As for me, I intended to continue my career without leaving my family. But, today, what do you want me to become?

[2] The prefect.

That was where his grievances were when I saw a stranger of about fifty years old enter: an intelligent, open and sympathetic figure.

“Sir,” he said to me after giving his name, “I am a former deputy. I exercise, in a department of the North, an important industry. My house employs a whole population of workmen. I undertook, in my spare time, a great work of public utility. What your master Pierre did in the moors of the Gironde, I try it at my expense in another climate. Besides that, I'm Gottlieb.

"You, sir?"

-Alas! Yes. All the persecutions you have enumerated, and many more, are exercised against me. I alienated the local authority. All the Ignacius and all the Sauerkraut in the borough are unleashed against yours truly. If you come to see me, you will judge by your eyes what I can be and what people are for me; you will see what I do and what is done to me.

This honorable visitor summed up for me, in a short summary, the vexations he had suffered and which were renewed every day. I recognized that my friend Gottlieb was privileged, an aristocrat, a spoiled child of the town hall and the sub-prefecture, in comparison with the former deputy. I introduced him to the young lawyer who had arrived before him, and we began to look together for a specific against their illness.

But my servant reappeared with a packet of letters which I opened in front of them, with their permission.

The first came from the south. It was dated from a place of war. The illuminated vignette which decorated the head of the first page represented a warrior surrounded by flags. The writing and the style could only belong to a young soldier.

"Monsieur," said the child (one of those heroic children who play battle so well), "I am eighteen years old and I would kill myself for the Emperor, to prove that I voluntarily enlisted in November, and that I am a brigadier candidate, pending the baton of marshal. For when you didn't tell my story positively, since it wasn't a field mouse that I killed, but a sparrow, with all due respect.

“Identically, it was not I who went to the municipal council, having neither the age nor the desire, but my first cousin, son of the elder brother of my own father, and whom you designate in your sheets under the illusory name of Gottlieb. Who, having gone against the list of the mayor in August, remained, together with all his family, exposed to all the vexations of the civil authority. Whence I ventured on the road from which it was bounded, and having killed a sparrow (pass the word to me) with a pistol shot on a tree, I was seized by the country guards who were keeping watch around his house by enmity against him, and delivered to the civil justice, which condemned me for offense of hunting with the fine, the expenses and the confiscation of the weapon.

"The whole amounting to a total sum of about eighty francs, for which I do not bear a grudge against the justice system, which carried out its instructions by applying the law, but against the country guards and specifically the mayor, who had stationed around my cousin's house, to catch us in the wrong, which they could have easily dispensed with. You will admit, monsieur, that he is a sparrow paid a little dearly, and that I had done nothing to the mayor, not having even been able to vote, for want of age, in favor of my cousin.

“Which does not prevent me, sir, from crying out with all French hearts in the presence of the enemy, absent or present: Long live the Emperor! May it be served by civilians as it will be on all occasions by your well devoted

“X…,
“Brigadier candidate for the… of… of…
in garrison at…”

The second letter was signed by a fairly important official of one of our major administrations. There she is:

"Sir,

“The simple reading of my name will tell you in which department I was born and why I am a Bonapartist by birth. The History of Napoleon is the Gospel where my revered father taught me to read. From my earliest youth, I dreamed of the return of the Napoleonic dynasty. In the age when we pass easily from desire to action, I conspired. All my life and all my fortune have been devoted to the holy cause which I have always confused with the cause of my country. The Emperor has deigned to reward my modest services by appointing me himself to the post I have held for almost ten years.

“I strive to make myself worthy of his kindness, for which I keep an eternal gratitude. My immediate supervisor, as well as MM. the inspectors of my service and these gentlemen of the central administration have always done justice to my modest efforts. I would be ungrateful if I did not praise myself highly for their benevolence. Why must I have voted openly in the last municipal elections for a man of my opinion, devoted like myself to the liberal ideas of the Emperor? This unfortunate man, whom you ingeniously called Gottlieb, dragged all his friends into his downfall. The mayor of this city and the sub-prefect of this district have sworn to blow upall who had sided with Gottlieb. Their denunciations against me alone form an enormous file, under which my innocence will infallibly be suppressed. What to do? Who do I contact?

“I expect my change every day, that they ask, that they hope, that they announce aloud in the city and in the chief town. I'd rather get rid of the mayor, who has made himself unsympathetic to the whole population, or change the sub-prefect. He is a wealthy, well-bred ultramontane. I assume you referred to him as Ignacius , because he has close ties to the Society of Jesus, founded by Saint Ignatius. By removing him from our home, we would do him no harm, because he himself told anyone who would listen that he would resign as soon as he had the cross. Couldn't you get it, sir, to have it decorated right away? Our country would gain from it;
