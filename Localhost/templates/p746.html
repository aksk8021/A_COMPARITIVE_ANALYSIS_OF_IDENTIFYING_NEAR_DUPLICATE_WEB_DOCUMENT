YOUNG WIFE'S BOOK.
The Young Wife's Book; A Manual of Moral, Religious, and Domestic Duties. Philadelphia: Carey, Lea, and Blanchard.

We can conscientiously recommend this little book, not only to that particular class of our fair friends for whom it is most obviously intended, but, in general, to all lovers of good reading. We had expected to find in it a series of mere homilies on the Duties of a Wife, but were agreeably disappointed. Such things are, no doubt, excellent in their way, but unhappily are rarely of much service, for the simple reason that they are rarely read. Unless strikingly novel, and well written, they are too apt to be disregarded. The present volume is made up of mingled amusement and instruction. Short and pithy Lessons on Moral Duties, on the Minor Obligations of Married Life, on Manners, on Fashion, on Dress—Dialogues, and Anecdotes connected with subjects of a similar nature—form the basis of the book.

In one respect we must quarrel with the publication. Neither the title page, nor the Preface, gives us any information in regard to the biblical history of the work. It may be taken for granted that every reader, in perusing a book, feels some solicitude to know, for example, who wrote it; or (if this information be not attainable,) at least where it was written—whether in his native country, or in a foreign land—whether it be original or a compilation—whether it be a new publication or a re-publication of old matter—whether we are indebted for it to one author, or to more than one—in short, all those indispensable details which appertain to a book considered merely as a book. The habit of neglecting these things, is becoming very prevalent in America. Works are daily re-published, from foreign copies, without any primâ facie evidence by which we may distinguish them from original publications; and many a reader, of light literature especially, finds himself in the dilemma of praising or condemning unjustly as American, what, most assuredly, he has no good reason for supposing to be English.

In the Young Wife's Book now before us, are seventy-three articles. Of these, one is credited to the thirty-first chapter of Proverbs—nine to Standford's Lady's Gift—and two to an Old English Divine. Some four or five belong to the Spectator. Seven or eight we recognize as old acquaintances without being able to call to mind where we have seen them; and about fifteen or twenty bear internal evidence of a foreign origin. Of the balance we know nothing whatever beyond their intrinsic merit, which is, in all instances, very great. Judgment and fine taste have been employed, undoubtedly, in the book. As a whole it is excellent—but, for all we know to the contrary, it may have been originally written, translated, or compiled, in Philadelphia, in London, or in Timbuctoo.


ROBINSON CRUSOE.
The Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner: with a Biographical Account of Defoe. Illustrated with Fifty Characteristic Cuts, from Drawings by William Harvey, Esq. and engraved by Adams. New York: Published by Harper and Brothers.

This publication is worthy of the Harpers. It is an honor to the country—not more in the fine taste displayed in its getting up, than as evincing a just appreciation of an invaluable work. How fondly do we recur, in memory, to those enchanted days of our boyhood when we first learned to grow serious over Robinson Crusoe!—when we first found the spirit of wild adventure enkindling within us, as, by the dim fire light, we labored out, line by line, the marvellous import of those pages, and hung breathless and trembling with eagerness over their absorbing—over their enchaining interest! Alas! the days of desolate islands are no more! "Nothing farther," as Vapid says, "can be done in that line." Wo, henceforward, to the Defoe who shall prate to us of "undiscovered bournes." There is positively not a square inch of new ground for any future Selkirk. Neither in the Indian, in the Pacific, nor in the Atlantic, has he a shadow of hope. The Southern Ocean has been incontinently ransacked, and in the North—Scoresby, Franklin, Parry, Ross, Ross & Co. have been little better than so many salt water Paul Prys.

While Defoe would have been fairly entitled to immortality had he never written Robinson Crusoe, yet his many other very excellent writings have nearly faded from our attention, in the superior lustre of the Adventures of the Mariner of York. What better possible species of reputation could the author have desired for that book than the species which it has so long enjoyed? It has become a household thing in nearly every [p. 128]family in Christendom? Yet never was admiration of any work—universal admiration—more indiscriminately or more inappropriately bestowed. Not one person in ten—nay, not one person in five hundred, has, during the perusal of Robinson Crusoe, the most remote conception that any particle of genius, or even of common talent, has been employed in its creation! Men do not look upon it in the light of a literary performance. Defoe has none of their thoughts—Robinson all. The powers which have wrought the wonder have been thrown into obscurity by the very stupendousness of the wonder they have wrought! We read, and become perfect abstractions in the intensity of our interest—we close the book, and are quite satisfied that we could have written as well ourselves? All this is effected by the potent magic of verisimilitude. Indeed the author of Crusoe must have possessed, above all other faculties, what has been termed the faculty of identification—that dominion exercised by volition over imagination which enables the mind to lose its own, in a fictitious, individuality. This includes, in a very great degree, the power of abstraction; and with these keys we may partially unlock the mystery of that spell which has so long invested the volume before us. But a complete analysis of our interest in it cannot be thus afforded. Defoe is largely indebted to his subject. The idea of man in a state of perfect isolation, although often entertained, was never before so comprehensively carried out. Indeed the frequency of its occurrence to the thoughts of mankind argued the extent of its influence on their sympathies, while the fact of no attempt having been made to give an embodied form to the conception, went to prove the difficulty of the undertaking. But the true narrative of Selkirk in 1711, with the powerful impression it then made upon the public mind, sufficed to inspire Defoe with both the necessary courage for his work, and entire confidence in its success. How wonderful has been the result!

Besides Robinson Crusoe, Defoe wrote no less than two hundred and eight works. The chief of these are the Speculum Crape-Gownorum, a reply to Roger L'Estrange, and characterized principally by intemperate abuse—a Treatise against the Turks, written for the purpose of showing England "that if it was the interest of Protestantism not to increase the influence of a Catholic power, it was infinitely more so to oppose a Mohammedan one"—an Essay on Projects, displaying great ingenuity, and mentioned in terms of high approbation by our own Franklin—the Poor Man's Plea, a satire levelled against the extravagances of the upper ranks of British society—the Trueborn Englishman, composed with a view of defending the king from the abuse heaped upon him as a foreigner—the Shortest Way with the Dissenters, a work which created strong excitement, and for which the author suffered in the pillory—the Reformation of Manners, a satirical poem, containing passages of uncommon force, that is to say, uncommon for Defoe, who was no poet—More Reformation, a continuation of the above—Giving Alms no Charity, an excellent treatise—a Preface to a translation of Drelincourt on Death, in which is contained the "true narrative" of Mrs. Veal's apparition—the History of the Union, a publication of much celebrity in the days of its author, and even now justly considered as placing him among the "soundest historians of his time"—the Family Instructor, "one of the most valuable systems of practical morality in the language"—the History of Moll Flanders, including some striking but coarsely executed paintings of low life—the Life of Colonel Jaque, in which an account is given of the hero's residence in Virginia—the Memoirs of a Cavalier, a book belonging more properly to History than to Fictitious Biography, and which has been often mistaken for a true narrative of the civil wars in England and Germany—the History of the Plague, which Dr. Mead considered an authentic record—and Religious Courtship, which acquired an extensive popularity, and ran through innumerable editions. In the multiplicity of his other publications, and amid a life of perpetual activity, Defoe found time, likewise, to edit his Review, which existed for more than nine years, commencing in February 1704, and ending in May 1713. This periodical is justly entitled to be considered the original of the Tatlers and Spectators, which were afterwards so fashionable. Political intelligence, however, constituted the greater portion of its materiel.

The Edition of Robinson Crusoe now before us is worthy of all praise. We have seldom seen a more beautiful book. It is an octavo of 470 pages. The fifty wood cuts with which it is ornamented are, for the most part, admirable. We may instance, as particularly good, those on pages 6, 27, 39, 49, 87, 88, 92, 137, 146, 256, and 396. The design on the title page is superlative. In regard to the paper, typography, and binding of the work, that taste must be fastidious indeed which can find any fault with either.


CHRISTIAN FLORIST.
The Christian Florist; containing the English and Botanical Names of different Plants, with their Properties briefly delineated and explained. Illustrated by Texts of Scripture, and accompanied with Poetical Extracts from various Authors. First American, from the Second London Edition. Philadelphia: Carey, Lea & Blanchard.

The title, which our readers will perceive is a long one, sufficiently explains the nature and design of this little book. It is very well adapted for a Christmas present, to those especially whose minds are imbued at the same time with a love of flowers—and of him who is a God of flowers, as well as of mightier things. The mechanical execution of the volume is unexceptionable, and the rich colors of the Dahlia show to no little advantage in the frontispiece. The poetical selections are, for the most part, excellently chosen, and the prose commentaries on each article in good taste, and often of great interest.

Speaking of alterations made in the Second London Edition, the Authors of the work say in their Preface "We believe it will be found that most of those suggested have been adopted, with the exception of one, which proposed the rejection of the first piece of Poetry attached to the Sun Flower." These words excited our curiosity, and turning to page 42, we found six lines from Moore. It seems these had been objected to, not on account of any thing intrinsically belonging to the verses themselves, (what fault indeed could be found there?) but (will it be believed?) on account of the author who wrote them. The Christian Florist deserves the good will of all sensible persons, if for nothing else—for the spirit with which its authors have disregarded a bigotry so despicable.

SUPPLEMENT
TO THE
SOUTHERN LITERARY MESSENGER.

PUBLISHER'S NOTICE.
We are very proud in being able to afford our friends so many and so great evidences of the Messenger's popularity, as are contained in the following Notices.1 From all quarters we have received encouragement—in the approval of our past labors, and in prophecies of our future success. We desire to call the attention of all who are interested in the advancement of Southern Literature, to the matter, the manner, and the source, especially, of the Extracts subjoined. We hazard little in saying, that never before in America has any Journal called forth so unanimously, testimonials so unequivocally flattering, as the First Number of the Second Volume of our "Southern Literary Messenger."

1 The Notices here appended, are very far from all we have received. Many are omitted for want of room. All those left out, are unexceptionably flattering to ourselves.

From the Richmond Whig.
The Literary Messenger.—Nothing is more repulsive to our taste, than puffing—one of the artifices of book-making and book-selling, reduced in this our time, to a science. It is dishonest, for its object is gain at the expense of truth, and its means are imposition on those who are not familiar with the tricks of trade. It is unjust, for modest and unobtrusive merit is often compelled to languish, from the rival advantage given to mediocrity or worthlessness, by the meretricious puff direct. It is injurious and disgraceful to Literature, and for ourselves, we feel a repugnance to whatever we see puffed, by which we mean praise disproportioned to merit, and praise administered by the shovel full, without the administerer being possibly able or pretending to assign a cause or to point out a beauty to justify his rapture.

Mr. White's Literary Messenger is either the most transcendantly able periodical in the United States, or its proprietor has been most particularly successful in eliciting the puff—for it attracts more of the notice of the Press, and is more uniformly admired and praised upon the appearance of its successive numbers, than all the Literary Periodicals in the United States put together. The North American, Quarterly, &c. are comparatively lost sight of. It is universally noticed—not only in the newspaper press of the great towns and cities, but in the obscurest village sheet throughout the land. As Virginians and Southrons, solicitous for the honor of Southern Literature, we are proud to believe that this extensive favor bestowed upon the Messenger, flows from its deserts, an opinion confirmed by our personal knowledge of its enterprising, esteemed and modest proprietor.The last No. of the Messenger (for December) which commences the 2d volume, is most emphatically admired and extensively complimented by the American Press, and we have read portions of it with much satisfaction. Among the rest, our friend Noah expresses his pleasure, and any dealer in Literary wares may be happy to receive the countenance of so fine a genius as the Major. We are no critics, and beg leave to adopt his review with some qualification. We would praise the Barbary Sketches more, for we really view them as the very best specimens of History by any American. We will not subscribe to the sentence against "Eliza of Richmond;" and the Major must look over the "Broken Heart" again, and the next time wipe the moisture from his specs.

The Critical Notices are much to our taste—decided in their character, correct (as we think) in judgment, and lashing dullness, as it always deserves to be lashed, with a cat-o'-nine-tails.

Major Noah says—

The Southern Literary Messenger for December. Richmond, Va.: T. W. White, Proprietor. We have repeatedly called the attention of our literary friends to this excellent periodical, now commencing the second volume, and sustaining its deservedly acquired reputation. It is not only the neatest in typographical execution—in whiteness of paper and elegance of type, of any American publication of the kind, but contains also a greater amount of useful and entertaining original matter, both in prose and poetry—especially the latter, which, taken en masse, is quite different from the namby-pamby trash that is spreading like an epidemic over the republic of letters—choking and smothering with its noxious weeds those gems and flowers of purer mould, which are the offspring and inspiration of nature and of genius. The "Sketches of the Barbary States," are written by an able pen, and are full of valuable historical details. The lines to "October," by Eliza, of Maine, possess the vein of true poetry; the tenderness and the luxuriant imagery of some of Mrs. Hemans'. How rich the pageantry of some of the author's thoughts when describing the gorgeous tints of an autumnal foliage:
"And the rays of glorious sunshine there in saddening lustre fall—
  'Tis the funeral pageant of a king with his gold and crimson pall."
The "Broken Heart," by Eliza, of Richmond, is a failure. She must not attempt blank verse for common-place subjects. The verses on "Halley's Comet" are smooth and passable. The "Reminiscences of Mexico" might as well have been omitted. These diaries and guide books, are "stale, flat, and unprofitable." If the writer had given us some insight into the mysterious ruins and antiquities of Mexico—its romantic traditions—we would have thanked him. The theme is exciting and absorbing, and would have been new, and a glorious prize for immortality. Mr. Poe's "Unpublished Drama" does not suit our taste. Why eternally ring the changes on those everlasting and hackneyed Venetian Doges and Italian Counts—latticed balconies, and verandas—time out of mind exhausted? The "Address on Education" is puerile, crude, and common-place. We cannot discover its "brilliant eloquence" nor "impressive energy," spoken of in the critical notice. The object of it was well enough. The "Wissahiccon," properly handled, might have been wrought into a stirring historical portrait. The lines to "Memory," are pretty. Those entitled "Macedoine," have much fire and power. But "Lionel Granby," is a redeeming chapter worth all the foregoing. Why not give one-third the magazine to so accomplished a writer, so original [p. 134]a thinker? The "Dream," is good poetry, for blank verse, which is saying much. But the "Sketch," by A. L. Beard, M.D. is superlatively beautiful in melody of rhythm and truth to nature. Thus:
"The red-breast, mounted on some tow'ring tree,
  Is chanting loud his merry, mirthful strain;
  And the sweet lark's melodious notes of glee,
  Are softly floating o'er the dewy plain.
  From the broad fields which wave with golden grain,
  Echoes the whistle of the timid quail;
  And the loud laughter of the reaper train
  Sweeps wildly by, borne on the passing gale
  O'er woodland hill afar, and flowery-vested vale."
The lines to "Mira" are smooth and full of tender feeling. The Critical Notices are full as they should be on American productions, and written with uncommon spirit. The decisions are generally correct, and we are glad to see the censures so unsparingly, but judiciously directed against the mawkish style and matter of those ephemeral productions with which, under the name of chef-d'œuvres in novel writing, the poor humbugged public are so unmercifully gagged and bamboozled.

From the Petersburg Intelligencer.
The Southern Literary Messenger.—We have to acknowledge the receipt of the first No. of the second volume of the Southern Literary Messenger, published at Richmond, by T. W. WHITE, and beg to call the attention of the public to this highly valuable and now well established periodical. The enterprising and indefatigable proprietor, has overcome the obstacles which have generally, hitherto, thwarted the efforts of those who have attempted to rear up a respectable Literary Journal in the South, and has the proud satisfaction of being hailed as the founder of a work, which is admitted by the Press, on every hand, to be one of the most agreeable and interesting in the Union. He has evidently spared no expense in carrying out his design of making the "Messenger" worthy of the reputation of the "Old Dominion," and the number before us, is, in all respects, unquestionably one of the most beautiful specimens of the art of printing we have ever witnessed. So much for the mere medium, or vehicle, by which mind is made to commune with mind. Those who would wish to form a just estimate of the merits of this work, must look beyond its beautiful and delicate outward garb, into the rich and varied contents of its pages. The Editor has certainly drawn to his aid some of the finest pens in the State; and although the real authors are not given, yet we are convinced, that conclusively as many of the articles "speak for themselves," if names were added, they would lose none of their interest, from the known paternity of distinguished writers.

We wish, heartily, that our numerous engagements would allow us to notice more in detail the several articles which have struck us as peculiarly meritorious. But we have no leisure for more than to call attention to the publication, nothing doubting, that whosoever shall open these attractive pages, will not quit them until he has fully exhausted their sweets. The article on Mexico, at this time, will prove very acceptable, and not less so will be the continuation of the "Sketches of the History and Present Condition of Tripoli and the other Barbary Powers," which, since the French have planted themselves at Algiers, we hope may, at no distant day, be brought within the pale of "Christendom." To the lovers of the picturesque, we recommend the article "Wissahiccon" as a charming description of wild, romantic, American scenery.The Editorial criticisms are generally just.—Whilst they "nothing extenuate," and refuse to deal out indiscriminate compliment and unremitted praise, they yet are free from even the semblance of that illiberal spirit which delights rather to triumph in the detection of an error than in the generous acknowledgment and commendation of a beauty. They embrace reviews of many new and popular works, which have lately issued from the Press; among which is the Life of Washington, written in Latin, and said to be a production of extraordinary merit. In short, we earnestly advise every person of taste, who is either desirous of amusement or instruction, to look through this last number of the "Messenger" and judge for himself as to its merits. The graver subjects are interspersed with beautiful scraps of poetry, and we scarcely know which most to admire, the sparkling gem, or the solid and useful body in which it is set.—We were especially struck with "The Broken Heart," and often as this pathetic subject has been touched by poets, we doubt whether a more simple, natural and affecting version of it is to be found. Witness this extract:

"And though she shrunk not from the love of those
  Who were around her, and was never found
  In fretful mood—yet did they soon discover
  The rosy tinge upon her youthful cheek
  Concentrate all its radiance into one
  Untimely spot, and her too delicate frame
  Wither away beneath the false one's power."
Whilst paying this just tribute to the merits of the article above referred to, we feel disposed to award even higher praise to "Marcelia." We feel no hesitation in saying that this is "the gem" of the present number. It is imbued with the real spirit of poetry—without any false glitter or tinselled ornament, it presents one of the most interesting pictures which fancy could portray. As we read the description of "poor Marcelia's death-bed," we seem to hear

"Low prayers come moaning thro' the leaves,"
asking at once, pity for her sad fate and forgiveness of her crime.

"The Sonnet," at page 38, deserves more than a passing notice. The truth and pathos of the scene represented, can scarcely fail to be recognized by every heart that has had occasion to feel or sympathise with the anguish of a parent deprived of one of the cherished objects of his dearest affection.

Before closing these hasty remarks, we beg leave to press on the attention of our readers the fact, that so much intellectual gratification cannot be afforded for nothing. Without a liberal and generous support from the public, such a journal cannot be sustained. Even the late "Southern Review," with a towering reputation and splendid abilities, was forced to close its career, solely from the negligence of the public in offering that patronage which many would gladly have tendered after it was too late. Patronage, then—patronage tor the Messenger, and it will be perpetuated, as an honor to Virginia, and a reward to its enterprising proprietor.

[p. 135]

From the New York Courier and Enquirer.
Southern Literary Messenger, for December 1835.—There is no one of the many periodicals of our country, to the reception of which we look forward with a greater certainty of satisfaction than to this young, but already more than adolescent magazine. It is always above par, always distinguishable for correct style and pure English—for neatness and elegance—rather perhaps than vigor, or decided strength of original thought—the absence of which quality is perhaps sufficient to constitute a weak point, in what would otherwise be almost faultless. In the department of criticism, however, this remark does not apply so fully—for the notice of new works, in the Southern Messenger, are, we have no hesitation in saying it, the boldest, the most independent, and unflinching, of all that appears in the periodical world. This is as it should be—over-levity towards rising writers is a more real sin than over-sternness; and we are sorry to say, it is a sin, into which most of our magazines are wont to fall. This number is one of more than average power, and the critiques on The Hawks of Hawk-Hollow—the Linwoods—and Norman Leslie we especially recommend to notice. They are evidently all written with equal sincerity, and force of true opinion, and as such command respect even where we differ from them in judgment. That on Dr. Bird's new book, for instance, is too favorable; and indeed we think that this gentleman is always overrated—that on "the Linwoods" is superlative, in truth, style, and taste; while that on Norman Leslie is severe to a fault; inasmuch as the criticism, though we cannot deny the truth of the greater portion of it, is paralyzed by the strong symptoms of personal hostility not to Mr. Fay only, but to all who may be supposed to favor or admire him.


From the National Intelligencer.
Southern Literary Messenger.—This journal has, very unexpectedly, left its Northern competitors behind in the race for fame, and assumed all at once a pre-eminent rank among American periodicals. We have just received the first number of the second volume, and find it superior, in every respect, to any of the preceding ones. It contains 68 pages of closely printed matter, in double columns. Besides the 68 pages of text, it has a double cover of 8 pages, containing matters relating to its own peculiar interests—thus avoiding the necessity of intruding such subjects in the text. Its paper is excellent, its type new, and its entire mechanical execution superior to that of any Magazine with which we are acquainted. The South has thus far every reason to be proud of the extraordinary success which has attended the Messenger.
