CHAPTER XIV
Hard day, certainly, but which will be rich in memories.

We had been quiet since morning. We fired little. In the gray sky, free of planes, under which a strong wind was blowing, birds were circling, terrified, and one thought that they would collide, that one would suddenly fall. It was cold, it was sad and we were unoccupied. Lieutenant Bernaut was smoking cigarettes. One of our comrades, Leroy, a nice boy who had just returned from convalescence, told me about his adventures at the start of the war. 'We held on very well, four of us, in that corner of the trench where the four of us were sitting.

“So, Leroy told me, you see, it was while mending the telephone cord that I caught that. Five months in the hospital, old man! two months of convalescent leave with Mrs. Leroy, finally I return to the front and my leg is as good as before.

"How did you do it?" Stork asked, not taking his eyes off him.

Leroy laughed.

" To do what ? to be hurt? to mend the thread?… I jumped over the embankment, quite simply, I crawled in the alfalfa…

"In the alfalfa..." repeated Cigogne.

- And then… "

Vigorous interruption, great uproar. We break up. It's the gust, we feel deafened. It does not stop, but time passes quickly, all the same. Everyone works their best. As a distraction, little. We are not looking for it.

The lieutenant spits out the end of his cigarette. A bird swoops down the field, as if hit by a bullet. I followed him with my eyes. He leaves immediately; I had foreseen it, simple fantasy.

Leroy, smiling, tells me that he has no more tobacco; I give him a pinch of dust taken from the bottom of my pocket…

Another shell not far from the shelter; it is the tenth. I received a lump of dirt in the face.

And here comes the eleventh… Bad news.

" Camels ! the thread is cut!

"In front of the observatory," Stork said quietly. Lieutenant, if I may...

- No, not now ! later ! You will be stupidly killed. »

But Cigogne forgets to hear. He has already crossed the embankment, shouting:

"In the alfalfa!" Serval! »

(In front of the observatory, we only see short grass; alfalfa, not the least.)

I stay in the trench, feeling half-blinded, my eyes full of dirt, useless, in short, and very unhappy.

Time seems slower. The interest of the spectacle turns into anguish. It's quite another thing to live in this rain with a friend not far from you.

Time suffers from a breakdown… Why did such a ridiculous comparison come to mind?

And the noise continued. I had lost count of the shells, one having burst between Leroy and me, close enough to cloud my brain.

More long, very long moments, then, suddenly, the ringing of the telephone shivered and Cigogne, his face still calm, reappeared crawling. With a bound, he was in the trench.

" At last ! damn animal! and… not hurt?

"Nothing at all, my lieutenant!" a few pebbles in the back. Communication restored? »

Leroy, who sees my face still full of dirt, asks me, laughing:

“Is that what you are sad about? your eyes are running, margis! »

At this moment, I realize, first, that the burst has stopped (we regain our footing in a kind of silence), then that Leroy, who is talking to me, is wounded in the arm. I point it out to him. - He takes a serious look and stops talking to me.

"Don't say anything, please, margis!" »

We are alone in the observatory. The lieutenant and Cigogne check the line, along the gut.

" Say nothing ? aren't you crazy, Leroy? »

I undress him, I bandage his arm. The wound is superficial, a scratch.

“Thank you, Server. All the same, please don't say anything.

- But why ? For God Sake ! »

He gets confused; he speaks fast and low:

“It's not easy to explain… In short, I'm barely injured, that doesn't count! So, you understand, I have an idea that Cigogne wouldn't like it... Maxence...

- No pleasure?

- Yes ... a scratch like that, it's more worth it. I wouldn't say the same thing if it was the first time, but now, listen! It's no use ! I'm telling you: it's no longer worth it! Instead of him not being injured at all, then, if he has the Croix de Guerre (he will have it, for sure), in the citation, it will be less chic, without injuries. He should have caught that. I will be cured tomorrow; it won't show… Thanks for dressing me up, margis, just… don't tell the comrades. I will manage. Tomorrow I will be cured. Word of honor ! it will not be seen!… Oh! I don't think he would blame me, but Stork, he's not like the others, you know… a good boy, but not… not… like the others. »

The lieutenant returns.

“Oh! there you are, my lieutenant! Leroy is slightly injured. One of the last shells, I think; the one who had sprinkled us all with earth. »

A whisper in my ear:

"Margis… it's not smart of you!…"

The lieutenant is not surprised. He tells me that Leroy, while the squall fell, occupied himself assiduously, right and left, in the most discreet, the most useful, the most courageous way, in his own way, finally.

“Leroy,” he said to him, “you are brave! and you Cigogne too... but I'm very angry with you, prank! »

On the evening of this noisy day, Cigogne seemed very satisfied, the lieutenant having promised him, despite the inexcusable "refusal of obedience", a fine summons.

"The Croix de Guerre will suit you well, Stork," I said to him, kissing him.

“Come on, Serval; don't put sentiment into it! it's too easy ; I mean it's too easy to mend something under these conditions; gestures of this kind really do not cost enough! I'm glad my cross makes you happy, but… ah! Leroy is lucky!… but…

- What ?

"If I had been wounded, how much happier I would be!" »

CHAPTER XV
We were very bored that night. To say something, I asked:

"What's your wife's name?"

- My wife ?

- Yes. There is no indiscretion, I suppose?

- Her name is…

- I had already baptized, according to the descriptions you gave me ... I had named: Florimonde ... I was probably mistaken.

"Her name is Lucienne." »

One would have said, from his air, that he was teaching me the secret name (the only true one) of an illustrious goddess.

What do you want ! Lucienne is very pleasant, but admit that if you look carefully, you'll find something better. Lucienne, it can be someone charming or unbearable, a delicious trot or a curt schoolteacher, but not the woman that Cigogne revealed to me. Lucienne, it's nothing precise, but what a name for Mrs. Maxence ! Stork's wife is therefore called Lucienne! I can not believe it. There is something offensive about this, it seems to me, but Cigogne hardly suspects it. Question of habit, no doubt. All the same… Lucienne!

I remained silent and only knew how to answer:

“Oh! »

We are not eloquent every day. But he resumed:

“Besides, Florimonde has a rather singular air; I understand Florimonde; I allow you to call my wife Florimonde. »

It is a permission that I will certainly not abuse!

CHAPTER XVI
Point of apparent moon: the shadow and, blocking the vague rectangle of the window, something which is not light, at most night a little less dark. We had a few hot hours in the trench today, but nothing dramatic or even interesting. Now shall we sleep?

" Oh ! exclaims Cigogne, suddenly, what will she think of me? »

This unexpected voice, among the rustles of the dark barn, almost frightened me." What is wrong with you ?

"Serval!" what will she think of me?

- Who is that ? your wife ?

- Yes ... Oh! Serval, my friend, how I would have liked to be wounded! »

The voice is really pathetic, it does not take long to move me. Around us, the mice are trotting, the straw is crumpling, the beams creak mysteriously, two cats love each other, without any restraint, on the edge of the gutter, a great breath, not a wind, but, one would say, of nocturnal breathing, enters, from time to time, through the window. Alone, in the middle of this concert, Cigogne's voice is disturbing. Sincere, this accent where concern borders on despair? Why bother with it: it is enough that it is poignant!

Our excellent comrade Leroy certainly doesn't hold a psychology office, and yet, hadn't he told me about this regret for Cigogne?

Let's listen.

“Lucienne undoubtedly had an idea of ​​me, through my letters, but always in this atmosphere, true or false, that the newspapers suggest of our life to those who see it from afar. She imagined me sitting next to you, in the trench, bawling and joking at soup time, riding through the village, walking along the roads, sleeping here; a few little photos that the lieutenant had given me captured corners of the landscape for her. She suffered from knowing that I was in danger, of course she hoped that nothing untoward would happen to me, but she was certain that I would remain a soldier.

"I don't think you're a civilian?"

— To remain a soldier is not only to continue to wear a uniform, a registration number, it is to perform all the gestures of a soldier, to assume all of one's duties, to honestly run all the dangers of the moment. What a profound disappointment when she reads my quotation which should have given her so much joy! a citation for a civilian, an ambusher; a stolen war cross, in short! Lucienne won't conceive of all these things clearly at first, but since she doesn't lack finesse, she will feel them in a deaf way, enough to… oh! Serval!... to be ashamed of it!

- The best, I replied, will be to let you continue! »

I would have liked to beat him! I lay down completely on my back and, my head down, almost thrown back, I contrived to guess the lines of the big ceiling beam.

“Listen then; there's nothing unusual about what I'm saying, but you have to put yourself in my shoes a little, try to think like me. You reason as a bachelor; married, we reason differently. 'Living with a woman you love, being linked to this woman by so many different ties, obliges you to maintain in her the idea she has of you. We must remain, in a way, similar to ourselves, we must. Absence is then a very hard ordeal. We feel his image fading, from a distance. How to retouch it, restore its colors? Ah! if I had been injured like Leroy!… she would have seen me again as she likes to see me. "Winning a cross of war for having, at the right time, retied two ends of thread and rolled some tape around it, is demeaning whatever you can say about it... and you would, moreover, only have platitudes to to present. Does one boast of having picked up a horseshoe on the road, when this horseshoe brings you good luck? "If Lucienne doesn't despise me, she'll think less of me." His love will suffer. She will no longer have the pride of her love. She will love me, so be it, but as one throws alms to the beggar on the corner of the street. His gesture will remain elegant, no doubt… it will never be anything but a charitable gesture. Lucienne will love me out of pity! what abjection! » what abjection! » what abjection! »

I interrupted him:

“Talk less loudly, Stork!

- I was shouting ? he asked, sorry! »

But I had no idea how much more horrible her low voice would be. He was panting, speaking low, and I was panting to hear him.

“You can, believe me, lose your calm when you see a life spoil like this, destroy itself, and just as I worry about the image that Lucienne has of me, I also worry about it. image that I keep of Lucienne. Is she fair? Does Lucienne remain the woman I loved when I left? Far from me, doesn't she change? Will I find the same Lucienne? I'm so afraid, when I go back on leave, that suddenly the dear smile that I always have in my memory comes undone, before the foreign smile of a new face. »

He was panicking, scrambling his whispers and sputtering. I was beginning to feel uneasy, for such murmurs lost all humanity, became mere noises, barely comprehensible, closer, it seemed to me, to the trotting of mice and the rustle of straw, than of a significant emission of words. I would have liked to be somewhere else, in the middle of the night, on the blue road, my legs free, my face washed by the wind.

And Cigogne dimly recalled those dreadful hours when the images that we make up of the world, sweet images that help us to live, are soiled. Why couldn't he fix them forever in their first freshness! “I think that was his thought, but I can't guarantee anything.

That October evening, in the barn, Cigogne startled me. I don't like it when nerves dominate their man so much…or else we decide to take bromide. — And then what is this fantastic conception of life where one makes an image of things before seeing them in their reality, their shapes, their colors? And, above all, how to live this imaginary life without being immediately chased away from your dream, since the tables have angles that bump into us, the roads have holes where you twist your foot, the sky is covered with clouds of rain when you want to see it blue? "By the way… wouldn't it have been better, perhaps, if Cigogne had been injured?" Alas! he would have found something else to say, I'm afraid, something in the same tone!

He did not finish his speech:

“What do you think, Serval? »

I don't answer anything.

“Listen, old man…”

Same silence. Really Cigogne annoys me after having moved me. I hear him sigh heavily and whisper:

“Serval has fallen asleep. »

He wasted no time in doing the same, without pretense.CHAPTER XVII
From the lavender notebook.

Ah! the brave man! I recognize him: he behaved well, he was courageous, simply, without phrases, without grand gestures, as he should be, as I wanted him to be. I would love him more if I could love him more, but perhaps I could love him better and no longer reproach him with fantasies without importance or gravity. Again, I was unfair to Roger.

And in what a charming way he announces his Croix de Guerre to me! It seems he's afraid of giving me too much emotion, so discreetly does he talk about it, as if something quite natural, on which it is not appropriate to insist. "My dear husband!" I only blame him for having forgotten to tell me, from the first line, that he had no injury. Was a letter ever read so quickly? I was so afraid to learn that my joy could not be complete! but no… nothing! “I hope I'll do better someday,” he says on the last line. Better?… how then? "What a fine character that of a brave man who is also a brave man!"

Really, they have very strange manias at the front. Not content with speaking a very special language, of which I can sometimes get an idea by listening to certain wounded people I treat, they still enjoy, it seems, dressing up their comrades, and also, but more discreetly, their leaders. , weird nicknames. Bizarre, indeed, and quite stupid, the one given to Roger: Cigogne!

Stork! it's inane! But Roger is not angry: he has too good a character.

Our poor Mahoudiaux was wounded in the right arm, rather seriously, it seems. The letter (dictated) that I receive from him is very nice. He is in a lot of pain, but the fever has been gone for three days. It will be nothing, I think. He talks to me about Roger's admirable citation, which he had just received through my care, and says very friendly things to me about it.

They are all the same! Maurice learned from Roger this ridiculous nickname of Cigogne. He finds it funny! I hope he will have the good taste not to write to me: "Your dear Stork... my friend Stork..." I would end up putting him in his place. From my next letter, I intend to call Maurice: "Monsieur Mahoudiaux." »

Roger must have been in trouble: his note this morning is a little sad. The dear boy, already so tried! What's happening to him ?

Some of my friends came to congratulate me on Roger's Croix de Guerre and his beautiful citation. Only the little Cartesque (she seems to have a taste for blood!) had the insolence to tell me, without saying it quite, that a slight injury… The poor girl! she is above all very stupid… Woodcock!

Maurice is definitely very lucky. We may give him a long leave. His arm stiffens. I'm sorry to know he's in so much pain.

CHAPTER XVIIIThe weather has changed; it's cold ; heavy squalls have blown during the last few weeks, then a snowfall has covered the country with this very clean coat that the vans, the teams, have persisted in, since then, in dirtying; but the meadows in the morning are really pretty. We lead a pretty tough life and the 307 rating is not my dream rating.

Yesterday evening we made the acquaintance of a new comrade, Jacques Doris, sent to us by the depot. A proud fellow, powerful, square-shouldered, Rousseau, but without excess, his face attractive and serious, at the same time, illuminated by astonishing lively green eyes. His mouth, somewhat ironic, gave a certain refinement to this face.

“Here,” I said to Cigogne, when I saw him, “look at that one; talk with him, take advantage of his wisdom, for he is surely a wise man. He must see clearly with his little clear eyes; he must feel finely, subtly, perhaps, but on the true plane of things.

"So you know him?" he replied, no doubt alluding to a reproach about his too hasty judgments.

I just laughed.

Doris was an electrical worker and, as soon as he arrived, asked the captain to take a tour of the installations which he could supervise, which he was granted. We set out today, at the crack of dawn, but soon, shells having begun to fall, Doris had to stay in our ordinary trench, in case of an accident at the lines.

"Marshal des logis," he told me, "I'm going to shine from the first hour!" A splinter will blow the device in my hands, I'll fix it in less time than it takes to say, you'll see that! and I shall have covered myself with glory!

- Doris, I replied (is it Doris that your name is?), first shake your coat covered with snow ... for glory, we'll see later.

'It's wrong to deprive me of a fine hope, margis!

— Doris, said the lieutenant, you think big!

'We're always like that, my lieutenant, for his debut. Later, we become modest. »

Then, addressing me:

“Margis, show me the map of what's in the little hole over there. It will be a real service that you will render me. Explain to me how it is built, this country on which we shoot and how we can recognize ourselves in it. »

I didn't ask for better. Except for the time to swallow our soup, we chatted without stopping, until noon, glasses in our fingers. I was delighted to have under my command a boy of such lucid intelligence and capable of sustained attention.

"And that gray spot on the hillside?"

“I think they're piles of sand, Doris.

“You know, margis, you'll have to give me more lessons in map reading and direct fire.

“Of course, Doris. »

About one o'clock we had a visit from Leroy, who had come to bring I don't know what note to the lieutenant. At this moment a few shells fell and I was still delighted to see how much Doris was following with interest the fire we fired in response.

“Oh! for sure, there is more pleasure here than at the depot, he said. We feel alive!

"Is this your baptism by fire, Doris?"

- Yes, margis! ... Vlan! one more!... We must quickly get used to it?... One more! They are not thrifty, the Boches! it hurts your head at first… but it seems to warm you up, turning your blood a little, and that's no luxury today!

"You," Leroy told him, "are already a good artilleryman." »

He looked at him in astonishment.

"I don't like war, but...

- You want to understand what you see, I say, laughing.

- Barely !"Understanding what you see," Stork added at the same time...it's often not easy! »

We talked like this intermittently; short rest after which Cigogne transmitted the firing orders again, Doris repaired an apparatus, the lieutenant studied the map while lecturing me in turn, and Leroy tried to increase the dull activity of the tiny stove to which we presented our feet and our hands from time to time.

“Here, my lieutenant, said Doris, it's settled, the batteries were bad. »

He did not move, looking at the map on the lieutenant's lap, then, in a hesitant voice, he asked:

"Why don't we shoot more to the right, Lieutenant?" The quartermaster told me just now that...

"It's because there's a recess behind the road where the shells get lost and you can't see from here." Look, my boy, bend over, follow the tip of my pencil... And you know, Doris, when Serval isn't there to give you information, above all, don't be shy: it's my job, it's my duty… But I think their shot is getting closer. »

Indeed, the last burst covered the horn of the little wood of Bahnholz.

An hour later, new rest. Stork was yawning. I stuffed his ribs.

“Do you mind the war?

- It does not amuse me, and then I feel that I have nothing to do, that I do not participate. It takes so much simplicity of soul to say to yourself: “Stork, my friend, the least of your gestures, the most humble, has worldwide repercussions! » and even if we would have said it to ourselves, how can we believe it? »

Our lieutenant had heard his last words. I was not surprised that he picked them up, for he often chats with us.

“Maxence, listen to me. Doing philosophy after the events can be used to compose books, doing it before is useful for prophesying, but, at the same time, it is enough to open your eyes and your heart. The war, admit it, Maxence, is not made for you alone, consequently, all that you can think or say about it will be incomplete, will be false, but enjoy it quickly while it is there! keep it from escaping you! »

Lieutenant Bernaut is twenty-three years old; all his feelings bear the mark of that youth whose sincere warmth and intelligent enthusiasm are immediately apparent.

He was silent for a moment, then added:

“I believe that, when peace is signed, you will suffer a great deal, Maxence, for having reasoned about the war instead of living it! »

Cigogne had tears in his eyes.

"And you, Doris," said the lieutenant again, "come here: I'm going to explain the last shot to you." »

Then the accident happened.

It was one thirty-two (my stopped watch later provided me with this precision). A shell, which was the penultimate of the day, tore through the roof of our observatory and destroyed the southwest corner. It burst, making an incredible mess that I cannot describe or paint; at most I could say the few brutal memories I have of it. First a great noise and the impression that, lifted from the ground, I suddenly fall back on my head, then, in the opaque shadow, a monotonous and thin cry (where does it come from?) like the distant cry, at night, at sea, from a ship's siren. Before my eyes, red and yellow fireworks swirl. I feel my shoulders taken and my legs free, very alive, but breathing badly, my face, throat, chest aching. I hear a second burst, thicker. The weight that suffocates me receives an overload. My legs are still free and I move them furiously; the siren cries mournfully, then, suddenly, silence... and I sink, without difficulty, into deep water, very low, very low, very slowly, my gaze hallucinated by these yellow and red wheels of light, but my ears deaf ; then nothing.

A few minutes ; maybe half an hour...

“He was lucky to have received this mattress on the face! said Stork's voice.

- Hopefully it is not too damaged! replies the lieutenant.

"He would move his legs less," said Cigogne.

— Yes, the phone is working. »

This is Leroy speaking.
