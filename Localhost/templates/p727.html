- No, my old man, I admire! Ah! Maurice, this library really completes the campaign in a very rare way! The more I see La Cassolette, the more I like it; we would spend our lives there!

"I intend to spend mine there," said Mahoudiaux. Do not remain standing, my children; do not forget that it is I who have been injured in the arm; you, it's to the leg… Sit down! »

Stork suddenly turned pale. I am watching him. Yes, he turned pale.

“Wounded in the leg! Oh ! Mauritius! so little hurt! And then, it's at the foot… It doesn't matter… we'll manage better another time! »

And he sits down.

Mahoudiaux is unhappy.

“When I make a mistake, my dear Roger, you should be so kind as not to report it. You know perfectly well that, loving you as I love you, it was not to be disagreeable to you that I said that stupid phrase. So, don't immediately look poisoned… And, by the way, let's talk a bit about your accident; I care about it ; yes, yes, I want it...

- I do not know what you can find new, Maurice, but if it amuses you, do not bother! cause! »

It's at times like these that we would kick him!

Mahoudiaux does not allow himself to be dismantled. He talks while strolling in front of the shelves of books, dusting this little in-12, wiping the morocco of this precious Lamartine.

“It amuses me indeed, as you like to say. Listen… and you too, my dear Serval, listen! you have seen our friend Roger a lot lately; you will let me know if I say too much nonsense about him. "Roger, you lack courage!" You had prepared for war; at the depot, you repeated to yourself every day: "During this war, such and such a thing or another may happen to me, and I feel that, in all these circumstances, I will behave well, without difficulty." When you left, you thus formed for yourself a very clear image of the war, neither romantic nor naturalistic, but composed with the precision of a little treatise of puerile and honest civility. At a ceremonial dinner, when you're in a suit, you don't put your fingers in your nose; in a trench, when you're in uniform, you don't run away at the first shell, etc I am convinced that, in each of the roles you had planned, you would have behaved very well...

'You can say,' I interrupted, 'he behaved very well, because I've seen Cigogne in some of these various roles, often difficult to play, and he was perfect. He knew how to win the affection of his comrades and the esteem of his leaders, he knew how to show coolness when necessary, to make a decision when asked to do so, to show cheerfulness, finally, when he was helpful and very brave to laugh.

'None of that surprises me,' said Mahoudiaux, 'because Roger has a naturally valiant soul; he's been faltering since his accident, and yet he was taken by surprise. "Come now, my little Roger, will you never be able to accept in life the unexpected which is almost all its joy and pain, this unexpected which gives us the keenest pleasure and the hardest sorrows?" So you will always have to imagine what you are going to live in order to live it with honor, to taste it? It is a too ridiculous pride to refuse the gifts of chance, it is a rather base weakness to let yourself be beaten, immediately and for good, under a forehand whose wouldn't have learned the parade...

"Your sentence seems to me very well balanced… It is, moreover, of high moral significance," replies Cigogne, who is staring fixedly at the ceiling.

Mahoudiaux lets out a brief word that is unnecessary to quote, then he adds:

" Shut your mouth. »

And resumes:

“Of course, you couldn't imagine that you would be hit in such a cruel way! Ah! If a shrapnel had demolished your face or mown your leg, you would have put on a good face, I have no doubt about it! But because a wheel crushes your foot and cripples you, perhaps for long months, you revolt, you become unjust, you torture yourself and you harm others.

"And," replied Cigogne, "my dearest friends take advantage of this to hurt me." »

He got up and walked out slowly, leaving us both heartbroken; Mahoudiaux's eyes were full of tears, nevertheless he affected the gruffest tone to say, behind Cigogne's back:

“Now he's going to martyr his wife a bit!… Ah! Serval, fortunately, there are books to console us for men: we find there all their madness, but this madness is fixed, we know its direction. »

At first I didn't answer, dissatisfied with myself and with him, with him who had been too brutal with Cigogne, with me who hadn't known how to say anything to stop him. Cigogne wrote to me last week: “Be charitable! Have I been, today, letting Mahoudiaux gallop and rush at ease?

“So you believe, my dear Maurice, that frequenting books is better than frequenting men? For my part, I wouldn't dare recommend it to an imaginative person… Is it less dangerous to live in the past than in dreams of the future, as our friend Roger does?

- Oh that ! what's gotten into you, Serval? Do you philosophize? I want to see only one thing in this affair: this poor fellow, whom I pity with all my heart and whom I love tenderly, tortures the people who cherish him, tortures his wife by sudden fantasies of feeling and thought which are renewed every day, which change according to the hour and the weather, and perhaps the digestion of their author. He's always been that way, but the surprises of war have thrown him completely out of whack. Formerly, when he lived his little life as a quiet bourgeois who took care of chemistry, his dreams were modest, he fulfilled his dreams, he worked there, every day, like a good employee whose work interests him, and often, my faith ! those wise dreams were coming to fruition. The taste he already had for seeing himself other than he was, moreover, gave excellent results, prevented him from getting bogged down in the bourgeois swamp, interested him in a thousand different subjects: art, music and literature. , without at all disturbing his work as a chemist, on the contrary, but, since August 2, 1914, ah! my dear, what a painful series of abortions! You didn't read his letters, did you? I saw some of them at his wife. Crazy! crazy, I tell you! wicked and even, on occasion, skilfully wicked! Our poor Lucienne wept all her tears. And now it starts again! Ah! no ! Finally, if you think I've gone too far, what's the point of telling me now? You had to cut me off, as I begged you, Serval, before the damage was done. » prevented him from sinking into the bourgeois swamp, interested him in a thousand different subjects: art, music and literature, without at all disturbing his work as a chemist, on the contrary, but, since August 2, 1914, ah! my dear, what a painful series of abortions!

And I am close to believing that the wise Mahoudiaux was once again right. I didn't know how to answer him much, I told him a few pleasant anecdotes of which Cigogne was the modest hero, he told me many others from Roger's civilian life, and just as charming. Mahoudiaux knew thoroughly the merits as well as the failings of our friend.

“To put an end to it,” he concluded, “I grant you, Serval, that I acted like a brute, which happens to me more often than I would like. Roger is suffering, that's the important point; receiving him at home, what right do I have to yell at him like that? Thanks for letting me feel it. We must now comfort the unfortunate Stork as best we can. »

We found him on the terrace, in the company of Lucienne, playing with Domino, the little black and white cat. All three seemed happy. Lucienne's eyes had their sweetest gaze, Cigogne was laughing out loud and Domino was doing, like any little beast of his kind from whom you show and remove a ball of paper: he beat the air with his paws. barely armed.

"My old Maurice," said Cigogne with the most cheerful air, "bring me some cigarettes, I don't have any left: you'll find a packet on the sideboard in the dining room." Thank you… "

But, before making the errand, Mahoudiaux took Roger's head in his strong hands and kissed him on the forehead.

CHAPTER XLIV
On the terrace, at dusk… Lucienne and Roger are alone; Mahoudiaux lists in his library an abundant collection of pamphlets; suffering from neuralgia, I lay down on the sofa in my room.

“Lucienne,” said Roger, “come and sit down beside me; I would like to speak to you, my child. »Immediately Lucienne's eyes light up; she settles down in an armchair near Roger's chaise longue, lights his cigarette for him, changes the arrangement of the cushions on which he leans, strokes his hand tenderly...

“Lucienne, I have to tell you some things.

"Which ones, darling?" »

I don't think Cigogne really knows, because he is silent, the question asked being perhaps too precise. He finally says:

"Lucienne, first of all, I must ask your forgiveness, very humbly...

- But of what ? good Lord ! We are reunited, Roger; soon we will return to our home, our old ways, far from all those dreadful miseries we are afraid to think about. Already, we taste this happiness so sweet to be together, in a country which charms us, one and the other… What would you beg my pardon for, since we are happy?

- No, my child, listen ... I made you suffer too much, without knowing it, oh! certainly without knowing it… but you suffered none the less. I was an imbecile instead of a criminal, that's all! Let me speak, please!

"Roger!"

"My letters must have seemed horrible to you!" these letters, why did I write them? and you didn't let me guess anything about your pain, you answered with tender words… Admit that when you opened my envelopes you foresaw a new anguish each time; admit that you were gritting your teeth!

"My little Roger!" calm down ! what madness!

“I was mean, I was cruel. I seemed to be inventing new ways to hurt you, and you weren't saying anything!

— No, Roger, you were neither mean nor cruel, but a letter, you see, is written quickly, reads slowly, and so… sometimes…

- I must explain ... I believe, Lucienne, my love, I believe in all sincerity that I did not want any of this. This war… well… oh! yes, I thought she was beautiful, although, all things considered, I didn't see much of her! I asked nothing better than to play my role there, gloriously, but I was exalted empty, I blew myself as one blows a soap bubble… Sometimes it bursts! I never managed to do what I wanted to do, because I had chance against me, this terrible chance, this unexpected which gives us the best and the worst in life... So, you understand , I was constantly nervous, irascible, unfair. I dreamed of nonsense, and these nonsense, I wrote them to you, all raw, on a blank page, without adding the thousand little nothings that could have softened them, made them reasonable,

- Roger, you can not guess the joy you give me! I listen to your words, they are sweet to me, so sweet! Ah! my friend ! If I have sometimes been worried (unjust, me too, and more than you!) here I am well consoled, consoled forever. You have seen so clearly what, in your letters, troubled me! And I guessed you were so unhappy! and it was so hard! Roger, from that moment, our life resumes its normal course, its beautiful quiet course. This happiness, I no longer hoped for. »

They chatted thus, for some time, they told each other their tenderness; they shook hands, they took advantage of the fact that they were alone to embrace each other; then they talked again and Cigogne told his wife how he wanted to make good use of the end of their stay at La Cassolette.

“I'm going to start reading again, my dear; the memory of those odious days that I lived through terrifies me; their very memory disturbs me. Ah! this noisy, thundering and full of passion, cruel and jerky life, of which one does not feel the rhythm! I will find peace in books… Life is different in the books you reread! There, I will recognize old faithful friends, not forgotten, but whom I have not seen for long days. We will talk together. I know their pains and their joys, I will not be surprised. They can laugh, cry, deceively adore each other, drag themselves through the mud, beat the air with their wings without rising from the ground, be sick, agonize, die, die, rot, resuscitate if need be, without I am surprised. It was I who folded their diapers, their nightgowns and their shrouds,

"But, my little Roger…" said Lucienne in a timid voice.

She would have liked to stop him. He took no notice.“Luciana! Lucian! he said, I will find them all! I will accompany Julien Sorel to M. de la Môle, and Rastignac to Father Goriot, I will roll around in the garden of the Abbé Mouret, at the risk of crushing his flowers, I will return to Paris, with Colonel Chabert, knowing in advance all his misfortunes, but not telling him anything about them, and Adolphe will tell me the way in which he torments Eléonore; the personages of Saint-Simon will drag me to court, I will paint Celimene's cheek with my hands and I will draw the green ribbons of Alceste; with Valmont I will make Cécile Volange's tears flow and I will listen to Madame de Tourvel moaning; with Dominique I will bend over Madeleine's shawl and it is into my arms that Madeleine will fall!…”

But Cigogne was interrupted by Mahoudiaux, who, from the window of his library, cried gruffly:

“Let go of your husband, my good Lucienne, and come and join me! I want to show you my latest find: a marvelous sketch by Degas. Emilie had hidden it from me, out of spite, the nag! »

Immediately we heard Emilie respond in indignant accents to her master:

— That's not true, Monsieur Maurice. I put this image at the bottom of the drawer because it is not suitable. A little naked lady in her bath… You can see her behind. God forgive me! How can you show that! »

The rustic Emilie is less accustomed than my old Josephine to the audacity of art.

And here is the talk that took place on the terrace of La Cassolette, one Saturday, at dusk, before a sky the color of pearl and amber, a violet sea and darkened woods, such as I could reconstitute according to what Mrs. Maxence told me , six months later.

CHAPTER XLV
From the lavender notebook.

How well I did to persuade my dear Roger to accept this invitation from Mahoudiaux! We live here unparalleled days: the weather is magnificent, the country attractive, the heat very moderate, finally I would still use many other qualifiers, if I wanted to say how much this stay charms me... and I would not be able to do it ! - I am happy ! These three simple little words explain everything!

The afternoons, the evenings spent on the terrace of the Cassolette will give us very beautiful memories. Mahoudiaux, always the same, delights me with a pleasant and rough tone which does not fail to be affectionate, when necessary; our friend Serval (I no longer call him Monsieur Serval) is a very gallant man with whom I enjoy talking, and Roger… ah! it cannot be described and I am afraid that my lavender notebook will become indiscreet for myself, if I confess what is going on in my heart. — I find Roger as he once was, before the war: attentive, tender and gentle, so intelligent! so comprehensive! It's him ! “No, I won't say more; some days i'm afraid i'm too happy.

He assures me that he will get back to work, or rather (I want to be fair), he told me that he intends to get back to reading. It's a first step and Mahoudiaux has a magnificent library here. Little by little, Roger will forget the bad dreams that had troubled him so much, he will resume his studies in chemistry, he will once again become the dear Roger of yesteryear, he will think of the present day before imagining the tomorrow that does not exist. not yet, he won't be sick anymore, he won't suffer anymore… he'll be limping very badly… yes, the poor boy! like so many others. What does it matter! it seems that one must pay dearly for the duty one cheerfully accomplishes and all the pleasures one has had. But the war was for him a pleasure as much as a duty… therefore! In everyone's opinion, my Roger behaved like a brave man; Serval has told me that a hundred times.

However, it would not require too many readings. I fear the books will have a bad influence on him in the long run. I thought I understood that he wanted to read novels, especially novels, lots of novels… In short, he needs to distract himself; why shouldn't he read novels? Foolishly, perhaps, I was worried. I worry about the smallest thing!

This stay in the countryside forces me to resume my duties as mistress of the house. Mahoudiaux only cares about his books. Me, on the other hand, I get on very well with Emilie, a peasant girl who knew Maurice when she was a child. The villa is large, but Emilie does the cooking and her two nieces, two strong daughters, do the rest of the work. So everything works for the best. The fish is first rate; Roger, Serval and Maurice make feasts of molluscs which terrify me. I take a more modest part in it. It's very good. — Only one criticism: Emilie insists on putting garlic and oil in everything!... Of course, the butter in this beautiful country is mediocre.CHAPTER XLVI
For the past two days, my leg, less painful, has allowed me, if not long walks, at least short strolls around La Cassolette. The real voyages of discovery will be for later, but already these modest explorations delight me. I walk along the edge of the sea, I go wandering on the road, I follow the detours of a path in the woods, lined with brushwood. About every hundred steps, I stop, I sit down on a bench, on a rock, on a milestone, and I get to know the landscape. I fill my eyes with light, I let myself be penetrated by this everywhere-spread warmth, I breathe, I taste a fresher breeze, a little salty, I look at the finely colored shadows, the green shadows of the plane trees, the shadows strewn with yellow discs of the pine wood, the red, russet and brown shadows of the sea rocks, the shadows with a thousand reflections that run over the sea when the sun veils itself with a fleeting cloud… so many others. — I don't know much about this nature and by it I allow myself to be seduced to the point of forgetting that there are grassy meadows that I once loved, where the water meanders under the apple trees. In a while, I will start painting again; I'm starting to feel like it, but what results will I get?... I'm afraid of being brutal, of only transcribing the violent color of this hot, dry earth, struck by the day, and of not not see the subtlety, the delicacy of its colors. where the water meanders under the apple trees. In a while, I will start painting again; I'm starting to feel like it, but what results will I get?...

“We did 500 meters well, my friend?

"From the Cassolette gate, just 520," said Mahoudiaux; and now, if you believe me, Serval, we will stop. Here is a bench, erected for the purpose, it seems. In addition, this stopover will give me the opportunity to have a chat with Ms. Michel. »

We found ourselves in front of a discreet gray house, charming in appearance. A kitchen garden bordered it, bordered by a very thin parish garden, shining with those flowers that I take very seriously and that you don't cut to put them in elegant vases: they do better in the ground. A few steps from the door, there was a well; to the right, to the left, two old fig trees; further on, a curtain of yews with dark foliage. Petticoats and sheets, hung in front of the stable, were drying in the sun on a line.
