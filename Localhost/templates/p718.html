We were already in the observatory shelter and I was relaying the lieutenant's orders by telephone to the battery.

CHAPTER III
“If one could, at least, get hurt a little cleanly!…”

Here he is dreaming.

"And if," he murmured again, "this ridiculous nickname you gave me served some purpose, brought me glory... But I search in vain... Stork, Stork, it's always the grotesque bird to bent paw that we perch sentimentally on a roof in Alsace.

"Don't write a novel!"

- I would like ... I would like! »

And Stork blushed.

Some days, you see, he exasperates me. His absences are becoming too frequent. Our comrades then say that he is jumping in the moon, that he is going on leave. I would rather believe that he returns to himself or, more exactly, that, without changing places, he finds his true home. We compared him to a wading bird, now he presents me with the retractile image of a snail. Whatever he does, Cigogne is abroad among us. His home is within. When he leaves us in this way, don't insist: you will only get cold, even hurtful words from this scrupulously courteous boy, ripostes. He would even be rude on occasion.

The dog lying in front of a stove will growl if you disturb him. Stork warms to his heart. He has his little quirks. I have fun, on Sundays, fishing for gudgeons in the holes of La Largue! Why wouldn't Stork have fun in his own way?

“And then, leave me alone! you annoy me ! »

Saying this, he looks into the distance, so far that, to answer, one is taken aback.

CHAPTER IV
I have a lot of affection for Cigogne. To tell the truth, if I count the days, it is not very old, but these days were lived so completely, so powerfully, sometimes, that it seems to me that I have known Cigogne since childhood.

I saw him for the first time in the courtyard of the depot, at the very beginning of the war. Curry comb in hand, I scraped my mare's buttocks as he passed the stables.

" Pay attention ! he told me, Ranavalo is ticklish. »

I turned around and, seeing him, I burst out laughing.

“My friend,” he continued, “I tell you this without any bad intention. I still have a little sensitive left thigh in memory of a kick from Ranavalo… Besides, she has qualities, but, I repeat to you, she is ticklish and, sometimes, she shoots the fox. »

Our conversation ended with my thanking him. Shortly after, we found ourselves in front of a table in the canteen.

“Why,” he asked, “did you twist when you saw me?

- I do not know! sorry ! but, all the same, you know, you have an unusual head!

- You are probably talking about my face?

- Barely.

“Not ordinary, indeed; I have often been told so; you will get used to it. »

And since then we have talked every day, daily chance and military authority having constantly brought us together.

He was able to see, from the very beginning, see and understand, the boredom from which I suffered cruelly. Life on the front has its charm, a charm that I savored, noble, mysterious, magical and strong, which transports life out of the ordinary, very high, very far, and nevertheless holds firmly on this land populated by men, but life in a depot is, more often than not, intolerable. The hours seemed very heavy to me.

"Serval, you're a kid!" said my new comrade to me a few days later; you dream of the flavor of a beautiful fruit that you cannot eat. It's all bristling with prickles. Do you even know how to pick it? Its core is very hard; you would break your teeth there. We do not throw ourselves on a fruit because we find, from afar, a sumptuous color. This is the doing of a child. Serval, my boy, war is a beautiful bloody fruit… Believe me, if you bit into it today, it would make you vomit… Wait a bit. »

What were these new accents? We get used very well to brutalities, to repeated scatologies, they are not surprising, we expected them, and obscene phrases quickly become common use, but this way of saying...

He spoke thus in a muffled, very low voice, sometimes with strange little bird-like cries. Suddenly, we found ourselves elsewhere, in a distant forest, near a great heavy river on which curlews whirled. Exotic power of the voice! Certain perfumes have a similar magic and one feels transported to the other side of the earth for having inhaled a flower.

While I was making these journeys, Cigogne gazed at me with a vague air, not with that gaze habitual to dreamers and which is said to be celestial because it detaches itself from the things of this world, but with a mobile and never posed. The smoke thickened around us, the conversations became louder, laughter broke out, we even sang... On the wine-stained table, my comrade's long arms were stretched out like two useless things, with their glued to the wood.

Since this encounter, I was no longer bored. The little incidents of the day had not changed in appearance, but they shocked me less. I found less annoyance in seeing the sergeant Lieutard gesticulate, always howling, never appeased, and I paid little attention to the dangerous mood and the fake smiles of a Corsican sergeant whose name I forget and who seemed hold his character in an antimilitarist novel.

One of his compatriots told me that he was, in times of peace, an herbalist in Bastia and that in the midst of his aromatic plants, his herbs, his roots, he lived peacefully, impregnated with thyme and lavender, munching licorice from the dawn to deceive himself and not smoke tobacco in his dear shop. Moreover, the best man in the world and the sweetest. War made him a sly, malevolent, boastful, always servile, always ready to punish, impossible trade. This Corsican herbalist in uniform had made me very excited for some time. I forgot it thanks to Cigogne who, moreover, judged it without indulgence:

“It's the valet who thrashes the bellhop and the kitchen maid, but who licks the butler's boots. He must enjoy it. »

And Cigogne simulated a distant spit.

I had a friend. In the regiment, that means someone with whom you can talk.

“I have reason to believe that we will see each other often. What do you think, Serval?

- I take place ... similarly. I think like you. »

We looked at each other mockingly.

I said well: we were friends.

The man who was later to be called Stork admitted to me, one evening when I was questioning him about his peacetime occupations, that he was a chemist, but he corrected himself immediately.

"I mean, do you understand? that I do chemistry… a job, in a way, to have one; nevertheless, here it is… I also do something else. I have a bit of fortune, I buy a lot of books, and with my parents' fund: history, travels, classic authors, that makes up a pretty good library for me, so I read, I read... and I write also, yes, it is there, above all, what interests me.

“Have you published a book? I asked.

I didn't think I was saying an inconvenience. He suddenly jumped up and looked troubled.

" Good God ! no ! what are you thinking about ! Publish!… a book!… It's quite enough that I take notes all the time and that, at home, scraps of paper accumulate! Publish! what would my wife say, she who already thinks I'm wasting my time!

- How? 'Or' What ! I exclaimed, are you married? »

He looked at me fearfully.

“I… I forgot to tell you, my old Serval? Ah! what a fool I am! Yes, I've been married here in this town… for five years… And now, good evening, I have leave. I am coming back home. See you tomorrow. »

CHAPTER V
Two days later, strolling in the Place Alsace-Lorraine where a few poor and stringy melodies were spreading around a music kiosk, I decided to rest for a while at the Grand Café while drinking beer.

I entered and sat down at a table discreetly located in relation to those where my bosses frequented. Almost immediately, I saw my friend Cigogne, not far away, and was struck by his expression, both overwhelmed and haggard. He looked like the beast being tracked. He was looking insistently, and his gaze was also avoiding this fat, rather elegant girl named Adeline, I believe, whose hospitable legs were famous in the garrison. A good person, uncomplicated; his vaudeville vulgarity, his astonishing appetite, his truly joyful voice could please. In addition, she looked clean and her healthy skin kept a peasant youth. Nothing in her inspired terror. Now, it was she whom Cigogne was looking at with such horror.I told you, I was very fond of Cigogne and this fear pained me. What deaf drama was I witnessing? Adeline seemed quite innocent of it. She was busy seducing, with peaceful glances, a newly arrived colonial artillery captain, blond, friendly and mustachioed, whom she wanted to assign to herself as a temporary replacement for another very bald captain, her friend of ten years. years, for she had charmed more than one garrison, and this bald captain lacked jealousy. Suddenly she got up, threw the rose from her bodice at the Colonial, with a comical gesture that was like comic opera and dancehall, and went out. Stork heaved a great sigh of relief, gazed at the door with a dazed air, then took his head in his hands. My beer emptied, I went to join him.

" What are you doing here ? he told me. Sit down. Do you drink beer?

- A beer, gladly. It will be the second.

"Were you at the cafe?"

- Yes, for a moment. »

He stammered a few vague words, looked me straight in the eyes and murmured, without preliminaries, quite simply:

“Serval, my friend, I have just suffered excruciatingly.

- I noticed it! I answered.

"Did you see me?" corn… "

I interrupted him by asking, in a very low voice, but very scandalized:

"You don't have an unhappy love for Adeline, I hope?" »

My question did not seem to reach him at first. He was dreaming, then his gaze changed: he began to think. The grotesqueness of the proposed situation no doubt touched him, little by little, for his mouth relaxed; finally he burst out laughing.

“No, Serval, don't worry. I'm married and I love my wife dearly… Still, I spent a terrible half hour staring at fat Adeline.

"She seems rather pleasing to me to see."

- Eh yes ! but… what do you want…”

His features had lost all gaiety.

“…She came in, she sat down at the corner table. I have known Adeline for a long time. If she didn't say hello to me, it was because she was trying to seduce this captain with the big mustache who is getting up at the moment. Me, I didn't take my eyes off her, amused by her ride, and suddenly a horrible idea occurred to me. I said to myself: yes… but you are going to make fun of me! »

The tone of his voice was pleading: the human cry of a beaten dog.

“Keep talking, Maxence! »

Cigogne was still called Maxence at the time.

He tried to explain himself, a difficult task, because he did not understand himself very well.

“I said to myself: if I were to, for no plausible reason, fall in love with fat Adeline, what would happen? And I imagined the thing, I imagined myself in love with this brave girl, dreaming of her day and night, escaping from my house, on evenings of leave, to join her, lying down beside her blond body whose the skin must be soft to the fingers, lying to my wife, no longer loving my wife, no longer able to suffer my wife, and torn by this misfortune. My wife was crying, my wife had red eyes all the time. Of course, she knew nothing, she guessed nothing, but she suspected a terrible tragedy, she trembled thinking about it, she held out her arms to me, and I, I no longer dared to kiss her, I had... I I was afraid of being disgusted by his lips. I had to go back to Adeline! Against the fresh flesh of Adeline, I lay down with a big sigh of satisfaction, with the bliss of an animal. Ah! do you see that Serval? you see that ? It's sickening! My poor wife will die! »

He was almost talking in my ear.

“But, big fool! I whispered.

- No ! let me finish!... If I meet her, tomorrow, in the street; because tomorrow I'm going for a walk with my wife, I promised her… So, if I meet Adeline… I can see her from afar, holding her pink parasol, can't I? I suggest that my wife sit down on a bench, in the shade; I remain standing in front of her. I look at the ground, as if she had dropped something; she also looks under the bench and immediately I walk away… Adeline is a few steps away. I walk towards her; I offer her my arm… “Come, Adeline! " and…

- And you will shut up! you are crazy ! I interrupted, while Cigogne stammered thickly (one would have thought he was drunk):

"But I love my wife, Serval!" I love it ! »

CHAPTER VI
I admit it: I feel very embarrassed to talk to you about Cigogne. It always seems to me that I depict him badly, that I simply draw the portrait of a madman, and that in a not very honest way, since I underline, to the detriment of the others, the only features in which his madness is revealed.

“Why, you will ask, was he your friend? Why this misplaced, useless affection, especially at a time when minutes are so valuable? It's madness to waste minutes of affection. »

Yes, yes, I hear you! And you say again:

“Pity, in a pinch! but your friendship... As I see it, he hardly deserved it. »

So I make you see it badly. His oddities, admittedly very real, prevented me from highlighting the qualities of this boy whose soul was clouded with dreams and whose will was destroyed by too many illusions… Pity? not ! it was indeed affection that he inspired in me. Cigogne was aware of his weakness, he was ashamed of it, but not every day and never quite…complications where the heart and the mind each play their part. A detail, any detail, suddenly set him on a path that ended nowhere and which he followed anyway; he felt ridiculous, eternally ridiculous, for the innocent granting of a nickname (and this nickname, at the beginning of the war, was not yet heroic: Stork meant nothing; later he would have suffered more from it); gold,

Moreover, in the small jobs of daily life, he was a good regular, devoted soldier; he did his duty, as he should, but I cannot, however, present to you all these happy images of my subject, for you would say, this time:

“A good soldier? Is he the only one? He did his duty! How many others have done it! Why speak specifically of this one? »

If I mention him, isn't it, precisely, because he had more difficulty than another to act, sometimes, in this way which seems so banal to you? No, it's not the life of a hero that I'm telling you about, it's the life of a man hampered by his imagination and who, after all, only hurt himself. same.

And who tells you that he didn't suffer atrociously when he forged a temptation by looking at fat Adeline?... Pity him if you want for this absurd temptation. But who tells you that he didn't fight valiantly trying to overcome her?... So be fair and, because of this fight, give her a little affection. - Me, I'm just telling you what I saw and heard, what I assumed or thought I understood, nothing more ... Finally, if you don't like my friend Stork too much, if he really irritates you, erase his memory.

It seems to me that we left him when he was assuring me of his love for Mme Maxence , his wife. - We proceed.He had met her in Algiers and had quickly fallen in love with her. At that time, he was studying chemistry at a special school. A young woman interviewed came to distract him. A few walks on the Place du Gouvernement, during busy hours and during music, two or three appointments in the surroundings, talks with his family where he had introduced her… a whole little banal and bourgeois novel, without interest, a very mediocre love affair. — He told me the story, the very day after our conversation at the Grand Café, in the room dark with flies, and in snatches, in a painful voice, to such an extent that I had to sew up the fragments myself. 'story.

“And then no! he exclaimed, I must be mistaken! it's not that ! »

Stopped in the middle of a sentence, there was no way to get a word out of him.

This project of union displeased his parents. The person their son wanted to marry belonged to a very honorable family and could not fail to be charming, but how could we forget that a first marriage with a certain sea captain had once caused a stir in the town. Of these shameful gossip, there is always something left. Since her divorce, the outfit of the young woman allowed no criticism and the long-distance captain had gone to die (of the plague, it was said) in some distant country. - Anything ! we talked a lot. My friend's parents remembered it too well.

'But,' they said, 'we admit that she is charming, quite! »

Charming! they only found her charming! — Cigogne couldn't believe it. The red of anger rose to his face recalling this memory. He would then describe it to me and, for a long time, would not stop. 'I came to imagine a small, slender woman, very dark, with large soft eyes, short, curly black hair, a lithe waist. Already I saw in her something disquieting, something too small, evasive, her real charm perhaps, the very thing that had seduced Cigogne from the start.

He touched me with the passionate effort he put into describing his idol. So many superfluous words, so much trouble and application, but also, so much complacency!

“Imagine a little Burmese princess getting off her precious wood junk…”

I couldn't help laughing.

"I'm sorry, my friend! the Burmese princesses have smooth, tightly combed, almost varnished hair; but you said, I believe, that your wife was shaking a curly head with short hair?

- Looped? ... looped? ... yes, perhaps, at that time ... but what can it do you? »

He continued:

“Look at her in her pink veils!… Her first husband knew the Far East… Hey! no, however! at first it seems to me that he was on the South American lines. You confused me with your stupid interruption. Shut your mouth ! She still retained a scent of China, India, Ceylon. She was dancing… oh! I so wanted her to know how to dance! »

It was obviously literature (I don't judge its quality). If my friend had noticed this, I would certainly have interrupted him, but he was talking as if I weren't there. His head, carried by a long neck and plucked, one might say, his hair seemed so little, turned slowly from right to left, while he blinked like a man who wants to bring back to light an image that has become imprecise.

Nevertheless, this romantic flow annoyed me.

'You forgot,' I said, 'a bird of paradise feather which she wears in her hairstyle and which swings, heavy at the end.

“O Serval! he replied, sorry! »

I expected an insult, but that, I no longer understood.

He whispered softly:

"Yes, you're right…the bird of paradise feather…dangling…heavy at the tip…How do you know its color exactly?" »

Now he was dreaming. "Was he placing that decorative feather in the black curls?" No, he drifted off and suddenly:

“Have you seen any jerboas? he cried; we find it here. They are delicious beasts, cute little things with slender legs… and what a look! Ah! my old Serval! I would have liked to give her hothouse flowers, pearls, a tiny, curly dog, a little boy…”

All the same, horses had to be stabled as they were returning from the parade ground, and this went on for some time, but the conversation resumed an hour later, in this same room which was a little less smelly than the canteen.

We were quite satisfied, the detestable Corsican adjutant having been admonished in sharp terms by our captain. I felt very comfortable.

“Hey, old man! did he receive his package… and in the face again! »

He answered absurdly:

“You can imagine it, I'm sure! You could paint it!

- Who is that ?

- My wife… "

The herbalist adjutant no longer interested him. He was leading me with a strong hand towards Algiers, towards palm trees, towards this warm country where he had loved. - I let myself go, at first, but wanted to remind him of tangible realities.

“Do you have children?

"Children?" no ! why children both of us? »

It seemed very forbidden. "So my question was weird?" Then he lit a cigarette and spoke in a calmer, almost quiet voice.

His parents had approved his choice, after a few discussions held in the family, without bitterness. This first marriage, which bothered them so much, with which Algiers had been so busy, owed, to tell the truth, three-quarters of its notoriety to the low quality of the husband. We end up agreeing. The long-distance captain having had the good sense to die far away (and isn't the plague an infamous death, a punishment?) we forgot the regrettable divorce. — Cigogne was happy.

“Oh! how I loved him! he cried.

And, in a completely hoarse and low voice, he added:

“Oh! That I like ! »

Really, I was beginning to know.Shortly after his marriage, his parents having died, Cigogne came to settle in France. As soon as he told me, he stopped short, talking to me only about his very absorbing chemistry work.

"You told me that you were interested in something else, that you were writing...

- Oh ! it is only a pastime for me, for me alone. And then, my wife likes books, certainly, but she prefers order and, what do you want! my notes are dragging. Besides, it still sounds like something I read; so, I'm tearing up.

"Will you show me to your house one of these days, old man?" I asked.

He gave another stupid look, almost scandalized, then, after a silence, he murmured:

" Sure ! yes, Serval, of course… yes! of cours ! »

After which, he began to laugh, without gaiety.

CHAPTER VII
At that time, I did not have the honor of being introduced to Madame Maxence ( I write this name with difficulty: it does not mean anything to me), because we left, three days later, for the front. I was a brigadier, Cigogne had become sergeant. We traveled together and we were happy to find ourselves in Haute-Alsace, definitely placed together in the same battery.

But it is, I believe, on the date of this departure from the depot that I must interrupt my story and open a parenthesis.

I made the acquaintance of Cigogne's wife a long time later, I'll tell you how. Now, during the long months that she spent in this sad provincial town where I had just been bored for a few weeks (the deposit is always placed in a boring and sad town), she noted in large notebooks bound with lavender, his daily impressions. For my part, when I was at the front, I wrote this story in my spare time.

You will see under what circumstances Mrs. Maxence gave me her lavender notebooks… I do not say “lent me” but “gave me”. They were full of household details that would hardly interest you. I only extract from it what has to do with Cigogne's life, since his departure from the depot, and I interpose these pages in their place in the sequence of mine, with, at the top: lavender notebook , so that one immediately remember their author. They will be able to clarify some facts, some feelings, badly seen or badly defined by me. Finally, let the reader not accuse me of indiscretion: I was explicitly authorized to use these notes as I saw fit.

They are, I repeat, simple notes, scribbled down in the evening, while it rained tirelessly in the street, while the wind moaned in an often mournful voice and as the boats faded into the corner of the harbor where they seemed to compose a family reunion. If they follow each other badly enough, it's because I've left a lot of them unemployed. The ones I chose were for the sole purpose of developing my story… And above all, don't try to find literature there! We would perhaps raise it (and rather mediocre), flourishing Stork's speeches, but, in his wife's lavender notebooks, no.

So it's understood, isn't it? that the pages of the lavender notebook are by a different author and in a feminine handwriting.

This being well understood, we will join Cigogne in Haute-Alsace.

CHAPTER VIII
A small village, picturesque and not too dirty, such as I would have imagined in advance for my pleasure. No surprise, in short; pleasant viewpoints all around; a truly rustic atmosphere. Some natives seem to offer a pleasant welcome. Comrades who arrived before us praised Father Dietrich's cellar.
