It has often been stated that no two well-designed sewerage schemes are alike, and although this truism is usually applied to inland towns, it applies with far greater force to schemes for coastal towns and towns situated on the banks of our large rivers where the sewage is discharged into tidal waters. The essence of good designing is that every detail shall be carefully thought out with a view to meeting the special conditions of the case to the best advantage, and at the least possible expense, so that the maximum efficiency is combined with the minimum cost. It will therefore be desirable to consider the main conditions governing the design of schemes for sea-coast towns before describing a few typical cases of sea outfalls. Starting with the postulate that it is essential for the sewage to be effectually and permanently disposed of when it is discharged into tidal waters, we find that this result is largely dependent on the nature of the currents, which in their turn depend upon the rise and fall of the tide, caused chiefly by the attraction of the moon, but also to a less extent by the attraction of the sun. The subject of sewage disposal in tidal waters, therefore, divides itself naturally into two parts: first, the consideration of the tides and currents; and, secondly, the design of the works.

The tidal attraction is primarily due to the natural effect of gravity, whereby the attraction between two bodies is in direct proportion to the product of their respective masses and in inverse proportion to the square of their distance apart; but as the tide-producing effect of the sun and moon is a differential attraction, and not a direct one, their relative effect is inversely as the cube of their distances. The mass of the sun is about 324,000 times as great as that of the earth, and it is about 93 millions of miles away, while the mass of the moon is about 1-80th of that of the earth, but it averages only 240,000 miles away, varying between 220,000 miles when it is said to be in perigee, and 260,000 when in apogee. The resultant effect of each of these bodies is a strong "pull" of the earth towards them, that of the moon being in excess of that of the sun as 1 is to 0.445, because, although its mass is much less than that of the sun, it is considerably nearer to the earth.

About one-third of the surface of the globe is occupied by land, and the remaining two-thirds by water. The latter, being a mobile substance, is affected by this pull, which results in a banking up of the water in the form of the crest of a tidal wave. It has been asserted in recent years that this tidal action also takes place in a similar manner in the crust of the earth, though in a lesser degree, resulting in a heaving up and down amounting to one foot; but we are only concerned with the action of the sea at present. Now, although this pull is felt in all seas, it is only in the Southern Ocean that a sufficient expanse of water exists for the tidal action to be fully developed. This ocean has an average width of 1,500 miles, and completely encircles the earth on a circumferential line 13,500 miles long; in it the attraction of the sun and moon raises the water nearest to the centre of attraction into a crest which forms high water at that place. At the same time, the water is acted on by the centripetal effect of gravity, which, tending to draw it as near as possible to the centre of the earth, acts in opposition to the attraction of the sun and moon, so that at the sides of the earth 90 degrees away, where the attraction of the sun and moon is less, the centripetal force has more effect, and the water is drawn so as to form the trough of the wave, or low water, at those points. There is also the centrifugal force contained in the revolving globe, which has an equatorial diameter of about 8,000 miles and a circumference of 25,132 miles. As it takes 23 hr. 56 min 4 sec, or, say, twenty-four hours, to make a complete revolution, the surface at the equator travels at a speed of approximately 25,132/24 = 1,047 miles per hour. This centrifugal force is always constant, and tends to throw the water off from the surface of the globe in opposition to the centripetal force, which tends to retain the water in an even layer around the earth. It is asserted, however, as an explanation of the phenomenon which occurs, that the centripetal force acting at any point on the surface of the earth varies inversely as the square of the distance from that point to the moon, so that the centripetal force acting on the water at the side of the earth furthest removed from the moon is less effective than that on the side nearest to the moon, to the extent due to the length of the diameter of the earth. The result of this is that the centrifugal force overbalances the centripetal force, and the water tends to fly off, forming an anti-lunar wave crest at that point approximately equal, and opposite, to the wave crest at the point nearest to the moon. As the earth revolves, the crest of high water of the lunar tide remains opposite the centre of attraction of the sun and moon, so that a point on the surface will be carried from high water towards and past the trough of the wave, or low water, then past the crest of the anti-lunar tide, or high water again, and back to its original position under the moon. But while the earth is revolving the moon has traveled 13 degrees along the elliptical orbit in which she revolves around the earth, from west to east, once in 27 days 7 hr. 43 min, so that the earth has to make a fraction over a complete revolution before the same point is brought under the centre of attraction again This occupies on an average 52 min, so that, although we are taught that the tide regularly ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours, it will be seen that the tidal day averages 24 hr. 52 min, the high water of each tide in the Southern Ocean being at 12 hr. 26 min intervals. As a matter of fact, the tidal day varies from 24 hr. 35 min at new and full moon to 25 hr. 25 min at the quarters. Although the moon revolves around the earth in approximately 27-1/3 days, the earth has moved 27 degrees on its elliptical orbit around the sun, which it completes once in 365± days, so that the period which elapses before the moon again occupies the same relative position to the sun is 29 days 12 hr. 43 min, which is the time occupied by the moon in completing her phases, and is known as a lunar month or a lunation.

Considered from the point of view of a person on the earth, this primary tidal wave constantly travels round the Southern Ocean at a speed of 13,500 miles in 24 hr. 52 min, thus having a velocity of 543 miles per hour, and measuring a length of 13,500/2 = 6,750 miles from crest to crest. If a map of the world be examined it will be noticed that there are three large oceans branching off the Southern Ocean, namely, the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans; and although there is the same tendency for the formation of tides in these oceans, they are too restricted for any very material tidal action to take place. As the crest of the primary tidal wave in its journey round the world passes these oceans, the surface of the water is raised in them, which results in secondary or derivative tidal waves being sent through each ocean to the furthermost parts of the globe; and as the trough of the primary wave passes the same points the surface of the water is lowered, and a reverse action takes place, so that the derivative waves oscillate backwards and forwards in the branch oceans, the complete cycle occupying on the average 12 hr. 26 min Every variation of the tides in the Southern Ocean is accurately reproduced in every sea connected with it.

Wave motion consists only in a vertical movement of the particles of water by which a crest and trough is formed alternately, the crest being as much above the normal horizontal line as the trough is below it; and in the tidal waves this motion extends through the whole depth of the water from the surface to the bottom, but there is no horizontal movement except of form. The late Mr. J. Scott Russell described it as the transference of motion without the transference of matter; of form without the substance; of force without the agent.

The action produced by the sun and moon jointly is practically the resultant of the effects which each would produce separately, and as the net tide-producing effect of the moon is to raise a crest of water 1.4 ft above the trough, and that of the sun is 0.6 ft (being in the proportion of I to 0.445), when the two forces are acting in conjunction a wave 1.4 + 0.6 = 2 ft high is produced in the Southern Ocean, and when acting in opposition a wave 1.4 - 0.6 = 0.8 ft high is formed. As the derivative wave, consisting of the large mass of water set in motion by the comparatively small rise and fall of the primary wave, is propagated through the branch oceans, it is affected by many circumstances, such as the continual variation in width between the opposite shores, the alterations in the depth of the channels, and the irregularity of the coast line. When obstruction occurs, as, for example, in the Bristol Channel, where there is a gradually rising bed with a converging channel, the velocity, and/or the amount of rise and fall of the derivative wave is increased to an enormous extent; in other places where the oceans widen out, the rise and/or velocity is diminished, and similarly where a narrow channel occurs between two pieces of land an increase in the velocity of the wave will take place, forming a race in that locality.

Although the laws governing the production of tides are well understood, the irregularities in the depths of the oceans and the outlines of the coast, the geographical distribution of the water over the face of the globe and the position and declivity of the shores greatly modify the movements of the tides and give rise to so many complications that no general formulae can be used to give the time or height of the tides at any place by calculation alone. The average rate of travel and the course of the flood tide of the derivative waves around the shores of Great Britain are as follows:—150 miles per hour from Land's End to Lundy Island; 90 miles per hour from Lundy to St. David's Head; 22 miles per hour from St. David's Head to Holy head; 45-1/2 miles per hour from Holyhead to Solway Firth; 194 miles per hour from the North of Ireland to the North of Scotland; 52 miles per hour from the North of Scotland to the Wash; 20 miles per hour from the Wash to Yarmouth; 10 miles per hour from Yarmouth to Harwich. Along the south coast from Land's End to Beachy Head the average velocity is 40 miles per hour, the rate reducing as the wave approaches Dover, in the vicinity of which the tidal waves from the two different directions meet, one arriving approximately twelve hours later than the other, thus forming tides which are a result of the amalgamation of the two waves. On the ebb tide the direction of the waves is reversed.

The mobility of the water around the earth causes it to be very sensitive to the varying attraction of the sun and moon, due to the alterations from time to time in the relative positions of the three bodies. Fig. [Footnote: Plate I] shows diagrammatically the condition of the water in the Southern Ocean when the sun and moon are in the positions occupied at the time of new moon. The tide at A is due to the sum of the attractions of the sun and moon less the effect due to the excess of the centripetal force over centrifugal force. The tide at C is due to the excess of the centrifugal force over the centripetal force. These tides are known as "spring" tides. Fig. 2 [Footnote: Plate I] shows the positions occupied at the time of full moon. The tide at A is due to the attraction of the sun plus the effect due to the excess of the centrifugal force over the centripetal force. The tide at C is due to the attraction of the moon less the effect due to the excess of the centripetal force over centrifugal force. These tides are also known as "spring" tides. Fig. 3 [Footnote: Plate I] shows the positions occupied when the moon is in the first quarter; the position at the third quarter being similar, except that the moon would then be on the side of the earth nearest to B, The tide at A is compounded of high water of the solar tide superimposed upon low water of the lunar tide, so that the sea is at a higher level than in the case of the low water of spring tides. The tide at D is due to the attraction of the moon less the excess of centripetal force over centrifugal force, and the tide at B is due to the excess of centrifugal force over centripetal force. These are known as "neap" tides, and, as the sun is acting in opposition to the moon, the height of high water is considerably less than at the time of spring tides. The tides are continually varying between these extremes according to the alterations in the attracting forces, but the joint high tide lies nearer to the crest of the lunar than of the solar tide. It is obvious that, if the attracting force of the sun and moon were equal, the height of spring tides would be double that due to each body separately, and that there would be no variation in the height of the sea at the time of neap tides.

It will now be of interest to consider the minor movements of the sun and moon, as they also affect the tides by reason of the alterations they cause in the attractive force. During the revolution of the earth round the sun the successive positions of the point on the earth which is nearest to the sun will form a diagonal line across the equator. At the vernal equinox (March 20) the equator is vertically under the sun, which then declines to the south until the summer solstice (June 21), when it reaches its maximum south declination. It then moves northwards, passing vertically over the equator again at the autumnal equinox (September 21), and reaches its maximum northern declination on the winter solstice (December 21). The declination varies from about 24 degrees above to 24 degrees below the equator. The sun is nearest to the Southern Ocean, where the tides are generated, when it is in its southern declination, and furthest away when in the north, but the sun is actually nearest to the earth on December 31 (perihelion) and furthest away on July I (aphelion), the difference between the maximum and minimum distance being one-thirtieth of the whole.

The moon travels in a similar diagonal direction around the earth, varying between 18-1/2 degrees and 28-1/2 degreed above and below the equator. The change from north to south declination takes place every fourteen days, but these changes do not necessarily take place at the change in the phases of the moon. When the moon is south of the equator, she is nearer to the Southern Ocean, where the tides are generated. The new moon is nearest to the sun, and crosses the meridian at midday, while the full moon crosses it at midnight.

The height of the afternoon tide varies from that of the morning tide; sometimes one is the higher and sometimes the other, according to the declination of the sun and moon. This is called the "diurnal inequality." The average difference between the night and morning tides is about 5 in on the east coast and about 8in on the west coast. When there is a considerable difference in the height of high water of two consecutive tides, the ebb which follows the higher tide is lower than that following the lower high water, and as a general rule the higher the tide rises the lower it will fall. The height of spring tides varies throughout the year, being at a maximum when the sun is over the equator at the equinoxes and at a minimum in June at the summer solstice when the sun is furthest away from the equator. In the Southern Ocean high water of spring tides occurs at mid-day on the meridian of Greenwich and at midnight on the 180° meridian, and is later on the coasts of other seas in proportion to the time taken for the derivative waves to reach them, the tide being about three- fourths of a day later at Land's End and one day and a half later at the mouth of the Thames. The spring tides around the coast of England are four inches higher on the average at the time of new moon than at full moon, the average rise being about 15 ft, while the average rise at neaps is 11 ft 6 in.

The height from high to low water of spring tides is approximately double that of neap tides, while the maximum height to which spring tides rise is about 33 per cent. more than neaps, taking mean low water of spring tides as the datum. Extraordinarily high tides may be expected when the moon is new or full, and in her position nearest to the earth at the same time as her declination is near the equator, and they will be still further augmented if a strong gale has been blowing for some time in the same direction as the flood tide in the open sea, and then changes when the tide starts to rise, so as to blow straight on to the shore. The pressure of the air also affects the height of tides in so far as an increase will tend to depress the water in one place, and a reduction of pressure will facilitate its rising elsewhere, so that if there is a steep gradient in the barometrical pressure falling in the same direction as the flood tide the tides will be higher. As exemplifying the effect of violent gales in the Atlantic on the tides of the Bristol Channel, the following extract from "The Surveyor, Engineer, and Architect" of 1840, dealing with observations taken on Mr. Bunt's self-registering tide gauge at Hotwell House, Clifton, may be of interest.

Date: Times of High Water. Difference in Jan 1840. Tide Gauge. Tide Table. Tide Table. H.M. H.M. 27th, p.m……. 0. 8 ……. 0. 7 ….. 1 min earlier. 28th, a.m……. 0.47 ……. 0.34 ….. 13 min earlier. 28th, p.m……. 11.41 ……. 1. 7 ….. 86 min later. 29th, a.m……. 1.29 ……. 1.47 ….. 18 min later. 29th, p.m……. 2.32 ……. 2.30 ….. 2 min earlier.

Although the times of the tides varied so considerably, their heights were exactly as predicted in the tide-table.

The records during a storm on October 29, 1838, gave an entirely different result, as the time was retarded only ten or twelve minutes, but the height was increased by 8 ft On another occasion the tide at Liverpool was increased 7 ft by a gale. The Bristol Channel holds the record for the greatest tide experienced around the shores of Great Britain, which occurred at Chepstow in 1883, and had a rise of 48 ft 6 in The configuration of the Bristol Channel is, of course, conducive to large tides, but abnormally high tides do not generally occur on our shores more frequently than perhaps once in ten years, the last one occurring in the early part of 1904, although there may foe many extra high ones during this period of ten years from on-shore gales. Where tides approach a place from different directions there may be an interval between the times of arrival, which results in there being two periods of high and low water, as at Southampton, where the tides approach from each side of the Isle of Wight.

The hour at which high water occurs at any place on the coast at the time of new or full moon is known as the establishment of that place, and when this, together with the height to which the tide rises above low water is ascertained by actual observation, it is possible with the aid of the nautical almanack to make calculations which will foretell the time and height of the daily tides at that place for all future time. By means of a tide-predicting machine, invented by Lord Kelvin, the tides for a whole year can be calculated in from three to four hours. This machine is fully described in the Minutes of Proceedings, Inst.C.E., Vol. LXV. The age of the tide at any place is the period of time between new or full moon and the occurrence of spring tides at that place. The range of a tide is the height between high and low water of that tide, and the rise of a tide is the height between high water of that tide and the mean low water level of spring tides. It follows, therefore, that for spring tides the range and rise are synonymous terms, but at neap tides the range is the total height between high and low water, while the rise is the difference between high water of the neap tide and the mean low water level of spring tides. Neither the total time occupied by the flood and ebb tides nor the rate of the rise and fall are equal, except in the open sea, where there are fewer disturbing conditions. In restricted areas of water the ebb lasts longer than the flood.

Although the published tide-tables give much detailed information, it only applies to certain representative ports, and even then it is only correct in calm weather and with a very steady wind, so that in the majority of cases the engineer must take his own observations to obtain the necessary local information to guide him in the design of the works. It is impracticable for these observations to be continued over the lengthy period necessary to obtain the fullest and most accurate results, but, premising a general knowledge of the natural phenomena which affect the tides, as briefly described herein, he will be able to gauge the effect of the various disturbing causes, and interpret the records he obtains so as to arrive at a tolerably accurate estimate of what may be expected under any particular circumstances. Generally about 25 per cent. of the tides in a year are directly affected by the wind, etc., the majority varying from 6 in to 12 in in height and from five to fifteen minutes in time. The effect of a moderately stiff gale is approximately to raise a tide as many inches as it might be expected to rise in feet under normal conditions. The Liverpool tide-tables are based on observations spread over ten years, and even longer periods have been adopted in other places.

Much valuable information on this subject is contained in the following books, among others—and the writer is indebted to the various authors for some of the data contained in this and subsequent chapters—"The Tides," by G. H. Darwin, 1886; Baird's Manual of Tidal Observations, 1886; and "Tides and Waves," by W. H. Wheeler, 1906, together with the articles in the "Encyclopaedia Britannica" and "Chambers's Encyclopaedia."

Chapter II
Observations of the rise and fall of tides.

The first step in the practical design of the sewage works is to ascertain the level of high and low water of ordinary spring and neap tides and of equinoctial tides, as well as the rate of rise and fall of the various tides. This is done by means of a tide recording instrument similar to Fig. 4, which represents one made by Mr. J. H. Steward, of 457, West Strand, London, W.C. It consists of a drum about 5 in diameter and 10 in high, which revolves by clockwork once in twenty-four hours, the same mechanism also driving a small clock. A diagram paper divided with vertical lines into twenty-four primary spaces for the hours is fastened round the drum and a pen or pencil attached to a slide actuated by a rack or toothed wheel is free to work vertically up and down against the drum. A pinion working in this rack or wheel is connected with a pulley over which a flexible copper wire passes through the bottom of the case containing the gauge to a spherical copper float, 8 inches diameter, which rises and falls with the tide, so that every movement of the tide is reproduced moment by moment upon the chart as it revokes. The instrument is enclosed in an ebonized cabinet, having glazed doors in front and at both sides, giving convenient access to all parts. Inasmuch as the height and the time of the tide vary every day, it is practicable to read three days' tides on one chart, instead changing it every day. When the diagrams are taken of, the lines representing the water levels should be traced on to a continuous strip of tracing linen, so that the variations can be seen at a glance extra lines should be drawn, on the tracing showing the time at which the changes of the moon occur.

Fig. 5 is a reproduction to a small scale of actual records taken over a period of eighteen days, which shows true appearance of the diagrams when traced on the continuous strip.

These observations show very little difference between the spring and neap tides, and are interesting as indicating the unreliability of basing general deductions upon data obtained during a limited period only. At the time of the spring tides at the beginning of June the conditions were not favourable to big tides, as although the moon was approaching her perigee, her declination had nearly reached its northern limit and the declination of the sun was 22° IN The first quarter of the moon coincided very closely with the moon's passage over the equator, so that the neaps would be bigger than usual. At the period of the spring: tides, about the middle of June, although the time of full moon corresponded with her southernmost declination, she was approaching her apogee, and the declination of the sun was 23° 16' N., so that the tides would be lower than usual.

In order to ensure accurate observations, the position chosen for the tide gauge should be in deep water in the immediate vicinity of the locus in quo, but so that it is not affected by the waves from passing vessels. Wave motion is most felt where the float is in shallow water. A pier or quay wall will probably be most convenient, but in order to obtain records of the whole range of the tides it is of course necessary that the float should not be left dry at low water. In some instances the float is fixed in a well sunk above high water mark to such a depth that the bottom of it is below the lowest low water level, and a small pipe is then laid under the beach from the well to, and below, low water, so that the water stands continuously in the well at the same level as the sea.

The gauge should be fixed on bearers, about 3 ft 6 in from the floor, in a wooden shed, similar to a watchman's box, but provided with a door, erected on the pier or other site fixed upon for the observations. A hole must be formed in the floor and a galvanized iron or timber tube about 10 in square reaching to below low water level fixed underneath, so that when the float is suspended from the recording instrument it shall hang vertically down the centre of the tube. The shed and tube must of course be fixed securely to withstand wind and waves. The inside of the tube must be free from all projections or floating matter which would interfere with the movements of the float, the bottom should be closed, and about four lin diameter holes should be cleanly formed in the sides near to the bottom for the ingress and egress of the water. With a larger number of holes the wave action will cause the diagram to be very indistinct, and probably lead to incorrectness in determining the actual levels of the tides; and if the tube is considerably larger than the float, the latter will swing laterally and give incorrect readings.

A bench mark at some known height above ordnance datum should be set up in the hut, preferably on the top of the tube. At each visit the observer should pull the float wire down a short distance, and allow it to return slowly, thus making a vertical mark on the diagram, and should then measure the actual level of the surface of the water below the bench mark in the hut, so that the water line on the chart can be referred to ordnance datum. He should also note the correct time from his watch, so as to subsequently rectify any inaccuracy in the rate of revolution of the drum.

The most suitable period for taking these observations is from about the middle of March to near the end of June, as this will include records of the high spring equinoctial tides and the low "bird" tides of June. A chart similar to Fig. 6 should be prepared from the diagrams, showing the rise and fall of the highest spring tides, the average spring tides, the average neap tides, and the lowest neap tides, which will be found extremely useful in considering the levels of, and the discharge from, the sea outfall pipe.

The levels adopted for tide work vary in different ports. Trinity high-water mark is the datum adopted for the Port of London by the Thames Conservancy; it is the level of the lower edge of a stone fixed in the face of the river wall upon the east side of the Hermitage entrance of the London Docks, and is 12 48 ft above Ordnance datum. The Liverpool tide tables give the heights above the Old Dock Sill, which is now non-existent, but the level of it has been carefully preserved near the same position, on a stone built into the western wall of the Canning Half Tide Dock. This level is 40 ft below Ordnance datum. At Bristol the levels are referred to the Old Cumberland Basin (O.C.B.), which is an imaginary line 58 ft below Ordnance datum. It is very desirable that for sewage work all tide levels should be reduced to Ordnance datum.

A critical examination of the charts obtained from the tide- recording instruments will show that the mean level of the sea does not agree with the level of Ordnance datum. Ordnance datum is officially described as the assumed mean water level at Liverpool, which was ascertained from observations made by the Ordnance Survey Department in March, 1844, but subsequent records taken in May and June, 1859, by a self-recording gauge on St. George's Pier, showed that the true mean level of the sea at Liverpool is 0.068 ft below the assumed level. The general mean level of the sea around the coast of England, as determined by elaborate records taken at 29 places during the years 1859-60, was originally said to be, and is still, officially recognised by the Ordnance Survey Department to be 0.65 ft, or 7.8 in, above Ordnance datum, but included in these 29 stations were 8 at which the records were admitted to be imperfectly taken. If these 8 stations are omitted from the calculations, the true general mean level of the sea would be 0.623 ft, or 7.476 in, above Ordnance datum, or 0.691 ft above the true mean level of the sea at Liverpool. The local mean seal level at various stations around the coast varies from 0.982 ft below the general mean sea level at Plymouth, to 1.260 ft above it at Harwich, the places nearest to the mean being Weymouth (.089 ft below) and Hull (.038 ft above).

It may be of interest to mention that Ordnance datum for
Ireland is the level of low water of spring tides in Dublin
Bay, which is 21 ft below a mark on the base of Poolbeg
Lighthouse, and 7.46 ft below English Ordnance datum.
