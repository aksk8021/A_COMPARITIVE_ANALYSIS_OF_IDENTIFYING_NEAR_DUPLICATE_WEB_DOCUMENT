This is the occasion on which this story was told to me by the most honest man in Strasbourg. It was last winter; we were going to make one of those hunts in Baden country from which at least a hundred hares are brought back, on pain of being considered empty-handed. The one who gave us this party and who drove me there in his car was the notary Philippe-Auguste Riess; he died this week after a six-month agony, and the Democratic Old Town mourns him. All who think freely, and there are many in this noble corner of France, sought his advice and followed his example; he exercised in a friendly way over his equals the authority which gives an infallible good sense coupled with an irreproachable virtue. No intelligent work of charity was undertaken without his assistance: he was the soul of the dignified and patriarchal city. We would make a republic more beautiful than Athens and Sparta, if we could unite a million men like him. This citizen of the golden age did not affect to disdain the present; his tolerance extended to works of contemporary art and literature. He went to the theater, he read all our books, gladly extolled what seemed good to him, and noted without bitterness public and private shortcomings.

As the hunting rendezvous was two hours from town, we had time to exchange many ideas and pass many people in review. In his always fair and moderate criticism, only one point seemed to me debatable.

"Your main fault, he said, and I address myself to all the novelists, playwrights and comic authors of today, is to study only exceptions: the theater and the novel do not live on anything else. . Adultery? exception. The crime? exception, Suicide? exception. Le demi-monde , this masterpiece by Dumas fils, les Effrontés , Giboyer , Maître Guérin , le Fils naturel , les Faux Bonshommes, exceptions; all of Balzac is a museum of exceptions, of deformities, of moral monstrosities! Is it then impossible to interest the reader or the spectator more easily? Life is fertile enough in varied combinations for natural events, moderate feelings, daily actions and actors caught in the crowd to produce, with the help of art, the effect of laughter or tears that you buy at too great a cost. ? »

I pointed out to him that in choosing from the crowd those characters who stand out for some enormity we are following the example of the masters. Since Homer, romantic and dramatic art has lived only through exceptions. Ulysse, Agamemnon, Achille, were not chosen at random from among the Lefebbres and the Durands of the Trojan War. The heroes of ancient tragedy, Oedipus, Jocasta, Orestes, Clytemnestra, Eteocles, Polynices, are exceptions; the characters of Shakspeare, Othello, Macbeth, Shylock, exceptions! Ariosto's Roland, exception! Le Cid, Polyeucte, Cinna, Rodogune, Nero, Athalie, Mithridates, exceptions! Don Quixote, exception! Don Juan, exception! Art is subject to a law of optics which condemns it to choose the most salient characters and even to exaggerate them a little. The portrait of any character, taken at random, neither beautiful nor ugly, can interest only himself. The ordinary man, with his half-vices and his half-virtues, his little contentments and his little sorrows, is not worth a penny. With whatever art you please to season his mediocre person, you will not impose it on the attention of contemporaries, and as for posterity, what do you want them to do with it?

"I am a man," replied the old man, "and nothing human is foreign to me." Let me tell you with Terence, who didn't put a single exception on the stage. They would be doing me a real service if they wanted to resuscitate for me the simplest, the most modest, the least exceptional of the men who lived in Strasbourg five hundred years ago. I would so love to compare his ideas and feelings with ours! to see what the average man has gained in this period and what he has lost!

— He has gained many ideas and considerably lost vigor; but that is not the question. This is literature, not moral archaeology. You think that all of us, schoolchildren as well as teachers, are wrong to seek out, cultivate and expose to the eyes of the people this rare plant which is called the exception; I maintain that our art would become contemptible if it brought together those average, uniform, indifferent creations which vegetate in humanity like vegetables in a garden. We write to be read, and the reader would not open our books if he did not hope to find better or worse types in them.

- You think?

- I'm sure.

- Well! allow me to submit the thing to your own experience. Let me tell you an extraordinarily simple story in which all the heroes, I am mistaken, all of the characters are average people, of modest means, of ordinary mind and bourgeois morality. I warn you that they are all interesting to the same degree, because they are all good, sincere and delicate, but that is all; there is neither wild passion nor sublime devotion in their business: no more exceptional than on the hand. Can a painting without shadows and without light attract and retain for a moment the attention of an experienced amateur? This is what we will see; I begin.

Professor Henri Marchal was, at the age of thirty-five, one of the best doctors in our city. I can name him by his name, and the others too, because the affair happened when you were not of this world. Everyone in question has been dead or gone long enough.

He was not an Adonis, Professor Marchal, nor a Quasimodo either. He could have walked for twelve hours in succession under the trees of Broglie without his face being noticed either for good or for ill. His passport said: ordinary nose and the same for everything else. He was neither tall nor short, neither dark nor blond; I seem to remember, however, that the beard was almost red, and the blue eyes, smiling and gentle; the body solid and slightly thick, but without trace or threat of belly.

Education had made him a natural Strasbourgeois; he spoke German without being Alsatian by birth. The father, a captain, had died in the service, leaving two sons without heritage, a big one and a small one, both scholars at our school. The eldest, who had a taste for business, went straight to Paris, joined a stockbroker and made his fortune: at least he became rich enough to pay for the registrations, the diploma and for five or six years all Henry's expenses. The other attacked medicine as a man who wants to earn his own living, and sooner than later. He was not noticeably better gifted than the average martyr, but he had a well-made mind and a strong will: after the doctorate, he pursued the aggregation, and here he was, at thirty-five, professor in a faculty who does is not, thank God, the last in Europe. The clientele had grown with the reputation, as always. Professor Marchal cared for the best families in the city and the surrounding area; he was doctor in title of the factory of Mr. Axtmann in Hagelstadt; there was no good consultation in Alsace without him. As he had order and economy, he soon bought a house on the Quai des Bateliers, and I leave you to imagine whether he was pleased the first time he paid his term to himself. He ordered new furniture, and from then on everyone understood that this young man was thinking of marriage. he was doctor in title of the factory of Mr. Axtmann in Hagelstadt; there was no good consultation in Alsace without him.

He ordered new furniture, and from then on everyone understood that this young man was thinking of marriage.

The general feeling was that he had the right to choose, and that no mother would be misguided enough to deny him her daughter. Besides the position, which was enviable, he enjoyed a good reputation. His conduct had always been, if not exemplary, at least decent and measured. He had enjoyed himself like all young people, but he had never debauched himself. A few pranks without scandal do not damage a young man's reputation or cause him to be ostracized by families. All the curious women of the city, and we are not lacking in Strasbourg, set out to find out to which heiress the professor was going to offer his hand and his name.

She was not long in finding: she was the only daughter of Mr. Kolb, professor at the Protestant seminary and canon of Saint-Thomas. Adda Kolb was then seventeen years and a few months old. Imagine an agreeable blonde, well made, in good health, educated enough, and of a very playful character. Those who find grace more beautiful than beauty would have deemed it perfect; but the detail of his person left something to say, and his intelligence did not exceed the average: good sense, righteousness, and nothing more.

Rightly or wrongly, the world imagined that Marchal was more in love with the frame than with the painting. The fact is that the Kolb family attracted good people by an irresistible affinity. The canon and his wife, married at twenty, seemed almost as young as their daughter. A sister of Mrs.Kolb, who had married Substitute Miller, lived in the canonical house with her husband and four children. Old Papa Kolb and his wife, a fervent pietist, occupied the second floor; their eldest son, Kolb Jacob, a highly regarded tanner, had his establishment in the neighborhood: he too was married, and the father of a fine and numerous posterity. We saw each other, so to speak, at all hours, and the tribe lived in close intimacy like the children of Noah in the ark. A stranger introduced by chance to the canon would have been struck by the collective physiognomy presented by this family. The whole house exuded cleanliness, regularity, dignity, cordiality. The feelings, the ideas, the habits of these characters composed a particularly honest and sympathetic harmony. I' the most usual expression on the faces was a grave, loyal, somewhat proud, and yet hospitable smile. This radiance that cannot be translated in a few words meant: “We are old bourgeois of Strasbourg; we have not a drop of blood in our veins that is not respectable; we don't have a penny in our pockets that isn't earned by hard work. We honor God, we practice the gospel, we love one another, we are fully happy, and we need no one; however, the home and the hearts are open to our neighbour, if he needs us. Arrive, good people, and take your place: we were self-sufficient, but you are not superfluous. » This radiance that cannot be translated in a few words meant: “We are old bourgeois of Strasbourg; we have not a drop of blood in our veins that is not respectable; we don't have a penny in our pockets that isn't earned by hard work.

The men in the best position held it a great honor to be received familiarly in the house. The mothers went there in the evening with their daughters; the young people did not hesitate between the brasserie des Trois-rois and the canon's salon. I can still see myself adjusting the fold of my tie in the antechamber the first evening I was presented there. There were two whist tables in a side room; the large drawing-room, hung with white paper with grayish foliage, was modestly lighted by two lamps. Mrs. Holtz , the widow of the examining magistrate, struggled on an immense piano in the Empire style; Ms. Kolb Jr. _prepared the cafe au lait in the dining room; twenty young girls in high dresses, but beautiful in candor and simplicity, were dancing the waltz in three beats. The first that caught my eye was Adda Kolb, tenderly wrapped in Professor Marchal's arm. Their eyes told me that they loved each other, or at least that sympathy drew them to each other. I conclude with everyone that we would see their marriage before long.

This idea gained so much credit that the friends, patients, colleagues of M. Marchal began to persecute him with their allusions. The finest were content to touch such a delicate thing, the clumsy (there are some everywhere) jumped with both feet into the dish. The professor had started by turning a deaf ear, but when he was directly challenged, he got very angry, affirmed that it was nothing, and asked the indiscreet people to leave him alone. The men took it for granted; as for the women, that was another matter: he did not have such a cheap deal with a sex to which everything is permitted. One said to him: "What are you waiting for?" The Kolbs can't bring their daughter to you. They will be too happy to have you as their son-in-law, but you still have to introduce yourself. Another accused him of dragging things out and hurting a poor girl who loved him. A mischievous woman pulled him aside and whispered in his ear: 'They say you don't dare ask for Adda Kolb because she's too rich. Rest assured ; I have learned from my notary that the dowry and the trousseau do not even add up to twenty thousand crowns. The position you occupy would allow you to find the double.

One evening when the talkative inquisition had annoyed him more than usual, he stopped at the edge of the Ill before opening his door and descended resolutely into himself. He addressed himself, speaking to himself, the questions with which the world had been persecuting him for a month.

" Well! yes, he replied, I want to marry; yes, I understood that it was time to put an end to the hollow life of the bachelor. A few more years and I would be an old bachelor, one of those selfish people who fatally sow selfishness around them. Yes, I still feel young and healthy enough to start a real family. Yes, MissKolb is among all those I have met the one that suits me and pleases me. Do I love her with a passionate love, like in the novels? I don't know, but all my feelings and all my thoughts for the past year have revolved around her. I have the highest esteem and the most pronounced taste for his father, for his parents, for this honored Kolb house: my glory and my happiness would be to be in it; but does Adda love me? Modesty aside, it seems to me that she sees me with pleasure. I don't go into the living room without her face lighting up; it goes to meet me as I run to it, by a sort of drive or instinct. My gaze never seeks his without meeting him at the very moment. In the dances where the woman chooses the man, she always takes me for a date. When we talk about marriage, she does not hesitate to say in front of me that she would like a reasonable and knowledgeable husband. The day I came to announce my appointment to the chair of internal pathology, she had tears in her eyes, I saw her. Last summer, at the Hagelstadt factory, when we danced by the water, what happened? Young Axtmann hung paper lanterns from the low branches of the lime tree; Lieutenant Thirion was carefully adjusting the mouthpiece of his cornet, and the lawyer Pfister was tuning his violin: I saw Adda pulling a little veil of black lace over her face. I asked her if she was cold. "No, she said laughing, it's a precaution that I take so that no one sees me blushing, if you tell me something. "God forbid," I replied, "that one of my words never exposes Mrs.lle Kolb to blush! "I know that, Monsieur Henri, and it was a bad joke. Do you forgive me?" - Mademoiselle, we forgive everything to those we ... respect. » Respect? Yes, I'm sure I didn't use another word. Never has a word, a gesture, a look escaped me that could disturb the peace of his soul. If it is true that she loves me, my conscience does not reproach me for having done anything for it.

"And if I had tried to please him?" If I set about it resolutely tomorrow? If I seized the first opportunity to declare myself to her and say to her: I love you, would you accept me as your husband? By doing so, would I be doing a blameworthy action? May be. It is not to violate the moral law, for my intentions are the purest in the world; but I would sin against French manners, and people would have the right to esteem me less. Morality is universal, mores vary from one country to another. In England, loving Adda, I would first get her heart from her, and then I would go with her to seek her parents' approval. In France, it would be wrong to talk about marriage to a young girl, if her parents had not first authorized you to do so. »

He tossed and turned this idea in all directions; all his reasoning led to the same conclusion. The custom adopted among the French seemed to him brutal and despotic, he saw in it an abuse of paternal authority; it is the heart that should speak before the interests and conveniences of the family; but what to do? The usage is formal, and whether one blames it or approves of it, one must submit to it.

" Well! Either, he exclaimed, I will follow the line. I will go and ask Mr. Kolb for permission to be loved. What have I to fear? Why should these good people, who have always sought me out as a friend, reject me as a son-in-law? I want to be clear about it and tomorrow, because at the point where I am the sooner the better. Let's go to sleep! »He went to bed, but he hardly rested, and the little sleep he tasted was shot through with a thousand dreams. Mr. Kolb gave him his daughter and refused her alternately, according as he fell asleep on the right or on the left. The first rays of morning found him exhausted and all the more determined to get it over with. Students in the hospital would nudge each other and say, “There is something. The boss is more feverish on his own than all the patients in his department. After the visit, he began to roam the town, and made the rounds of his clientele to save the noon hour. Returning home, he dined slowly, contrary to his habit, dressed as slowly as he could, and still took the time to correct the proofs which were not urgent, all to delay the fatal moment, without missing the word that he had given himself. At last, about three o'clock, he plucked up his courage and walked with a determined step to the canon's house; but, at the moment of seizing the hammer, he said to himself that Mr. Kolb would not be alone, that Adda could be at home, which would make the step useless, that besides there was a certain brutality in saying to the father himself, point-blank, unprepared: “Give me your daughter! Wasn't it more proper to take a bias and approach the matter from the side, feeling the deputy Miller, or the elder Mr. Kolb, the fat tanner, or some other relative of the young lady? This course seemed to him the best, because it postponed the difficulty a few steps. While Mr. Marchal was preparing to turn back in the direction of the tannery, the tanner,

“Hey! Professor Marshall! so you are studying architecture now? To your pleasure! This house is the oldest, but also the most solid and the most beautiful of the chapter of Saint-Thomas.

'Monsieur Kolb,' stammered the doctor, 'I couldn't see the house, I was only looking within myself. Yes, I was and still am in great perplexity. You arrive, so much the better, although I don't really know where to start what I'm going to tell you; but I was just thinking of paying you a visit. There is no turning back, I feel that the time has come. Do you have a quarter of an hour to spare, and do you want us to take a walk together? »

The wise and respectable tanner does not say no. However, his brow darkened: "I am at your service," he replied, "and please God that I find an opportunity to serve you!" »

He took M. Marchal's arm and walked with him for some time, smoking his pipe.

“Dear Mr. Kolb, the thing I wanted to talk to you about involves myself and another person you know well: Miss Adda.

"Yes, yes," said the fat man in a tone that meant: That's what I was afraid of.

The doctor continued:

"I hope the family didn't take my attendance at all badly?"

- No ; the house is open to all honest people, and those who resemble you do honor to my brother and to us.

— It's just… I'm desperate… but the gossips of the city have given themselves the word for…

'Let them say it, doctor, and go your own way.

"But Miss Adda is very pretty!"

- No ; there are three or four hundred better than her in the bourgeoisie of Strasbourg.

- I do not know ; but she has so much grace and wit!

"You believe that!" and I, who am her uncle, answer you that she is quite ordinary.

"Well, if I loved her, Mr. Kolb, and if I asked her to marry her parents, do you think they would be offended by such a step?"

"No, Monsieur Marchal, they would be flattered, and I myself am very sensitive to the honest things you say to me, although my niece Adda (listen to me) is not a woman for you." Don't get agitated, and let's talk like two reasonable people. You can well imagine that we are not blind in the Kolb family and that we have guessed your inclination for more than six months. We even know, if we must say everything, that my niece, if she believed herself, would prefer you to many others; but why did my sister-in-law and my sister and my wife always turn a deaf ear when you complained of being single, and said to them in a semi-serious tone: "Find me a wife?" It's because they couldn't give you the answer you expected from them;meMarchal. We know your position, your character and your conduct; we are convinced that you will make a woman happy; but there are two very strong and unanswerable reasons which deny me the honor and the pleasure of ever being your uncle. The first relates to religion: you are Catholic and we are Lutherans, and although my brother has blessed many mixed marriages, he should not, in his situation, set an example of such a compromise. Would he like it, my old mother, may God preserve! and which is for his children like a living law, would formally forbid it to him. You will tell me that you are hardly more Catholic than Protestant; I know it: you practice the universal religion which has the world as its temple and good as its worship. I'm pretty sure that it would be indifferent to you to bring up your children in such or such a confession; but your tolerance does not remove the obstacle, and besides there is another. My niece is seventeen and you are thirty-five; you are therefore twice his age. Pretty much you could be his father, because the canon is only three years older than you. I know that in the eyes of many people this consideration would be futile, that in a world a little less patriarchal than ours your marriage with Adda would seem irreproachably matched. Hey! my God! Fashionable prudence does not want a girl to be granted to a man who has not made up his mind, and, these days, a boy hardly arrives before thirty-five; but we are people of the past: our father is married at twenty-two, the canon at twenty, and I who speak to you at nineteen. It is a tradition, it is not a theory; you can dispute it as a doctor, we must respect it, we who are the old Kolbs of Strasbourg! From all antiquity, in our very modest house, the spouses led their peaceful and well-regulated lives in parallel; we marry youth to youth, ignorance to ignorance, poverty to poverty. Households are hampered at first, life narrow; the layette of the first child is a big problem to solve, fortunately the old grandparents are there watching and arriving on time, with their hands full. Ease comes little by little over the years; we find it all the sweeter in proportion as it has cost more work. We grow old side by side, the woman a little faster than the man; but we don't notice it, because any gradual change is invisible to those who never leave each other. And one has the happiness of bringing up one's own children, of seeing those whom one has brought into the world grow up, of saying to a big fellow bearded like a bear: Hey! kid! It's a beautiful and holy thing come on! that family life thus understood. It has a thousand advantages, one among others that today's Christians do not appreciate enough: I mean the certainty of a past as pure in men as in women. What do you think of the poor young girls of Paris who buy at mad prices a worn-out, withered and perverted old bachelor, the scum of banal alcoves and unhealthy boudoirs? I am not saying this for you, Mr Marchal: once again, we know what a man you are, and if we have attracted you to our home, it is because young and old, men and women, esteem you without restriction; but you are thirty-five years old, there is no science in the world that can take ten years off you. It is therefore impossible for the canon to grant you his daughter's hand, even if you renounce your father's faith, which I do not advise you to do. »
