"I have known Marie Michel for a long time," said Mahoudiaux. We played together, I pulled her hair, she slapped me, I beat her, all out of friendship; I saw her grow up, I served as her witness when she married Victor Michel, the horse dealer's son. They settled here; they have a kid, my godson, who is nice, two or three fields, olive trees, a few vines. They're happy. I love them very much, her and him. »

At this moment, the door of the house opened ajar and a beautiful person, tall, with an even face, crowned with admirable black hair, appeared on the threshold.

“Here, Serval: here is my friend Madame Michel… And when, like her, you have beauty and health, in addition to happiness, what can you complain about? »

To be honest, this woman was beautiful. Her dark, dull complexion, her royal shoulders, her slightly deformed waist, still affirmed that calm, rested majesty, without heaviness, which gave her the appearance of a modern divinity, protector of the fields, the trees and the harvests that the sun Golden. Peasant, to be sure, but goddess, her very first appearance inspired joy.

" Hey ! Mother Michael! shouted Mahoudiaux.

"Mr. Maurice!" At last ! Four days since we last saw him!... I'm coming! »

She descended the few steps that led to the road.

"So you can't come as far as La Cassolette to say hello to me, Mother Michel?" So...we're not friends anymore?

- Oh ! you know very well, Monsieur Maurice, that I am, as you say, a reserved person…

- Because I have people at home! Lets go ! more nonsense! In any case, Mother Michel, allow me to present to you, immediately, the quartermaster André Serval, my friend, with whom Roger Maxence was at the front. »

She acknowledged my greeting with a nod of her head and added with a smile:

"I'm not going to leave you on the side of the road!" you are not bohemians! Come and sit under my fig trees, gentlemen; I will make you drink white wine; in this heat, you will find pleasure there.

" Oh ! that poor sir! she went on, when she saw me standing up… he was hurt too! There won't be a single one left!

"Except Victor," replied Mahoudiaux. He's still doing well!

- Always good, Mr. Maurice, but let's admit he was lucky, the dear man! Around Victor, it's a real massacre; he tells me about it again in his last letter; I had goose bumps. And, all the same, the wretch; it seems to amuse him, like the bullfights when we went to Nîmes. It amuses him, Monsieur Maurice! do you understand ? Would my husband become naughty? It would change him!

'He doesn't become mean, Mother Michel; don't worry: he just continues to be well.

'He would be better off at home, near his wife and son. Oh! she murmured, these men! »

She turned to me to add with a charming smile:

"I complain about men, I often complain about my husband, M. Maurice, my little one, and it's still those three men that, with my poor father, I've loved all my life and everything. my heart ! »

All this, so simply, so nobly said! I esteem this woman more with every word she speaks.

“And the little one, asks Mahoudiaux, why don't we see him?

- The little ! You don't think about it, Monsieur Maurice! Your godchild is at school. Here is one who, like his godfather, will always have his nose buried in books! That doesn't stop him from loving the countryside, working in the fields and fishing. He's already done his part, the brat; looks like a man! Here, between us, we replace the father; Maurice has good will, I'm a jolly person; when Victor comes back, for his leave, everything will be pretty much as if he hadn't left, thank God, our health and brave little Maurice. »

His gaze was delighted.

"Will we see Victor soon?" asked Mahoudiaux.

'In three weeks, I think. When he arrives, he will give himself just enough time to kiss us to run faster to La Cassolette.

"And will we see little Maurice?" I asked.

- You know sir, he comes home quite late. When he leaves school, he takes the tram, of course, but there's still a bit of road he has to walk on his little legs... Yes, I'll send him to La Cassolette to say hello to you all on Thursday next. Don't give him too many chocolates, Monsieur Maurice: he's a sweet tooth, almost as much as his father! and Victor does not willingly leave his portion to others, ah! no ! But, Monsieur Maurice, the little one will seem very shy and unnatural to you if he arrives at your house when there are guests...

'I assure you, Mother Michel, that they are not frightening: the Maxences had never been here, yet I have spoken to you about them very often and for a long time; my friend Lucienne is a good, sensible and kind little woman, her husband, a kind of madman who wouldn't want to hurt a fly (that doesn't prevent anything, does it Serval?) and as for André Serval , well, there it is, look at it! does he look like a bad guy? Moreover, he makes paintings, which softens manners. »

But Madame Michel was still thinking of her son:

"And gentle with that!" she resumed, and wise, and polite!… Always obedient, always calm! Yet he knows how to defend himself when the other kids annoy him, and then he hits hard, I can tell you… Ah! the proud little guy! He was second in his class last Saturday, and the first is much older than him! Besides, he hopes to have prizes at the end of the year…

"You will kiss him for me, Mother Michel." »

We got up to take our leave; Madame Michel detained us at first and did not allow us to leave her until she learned how uneasy I was walking.

"So we'll have to see them all damaged!" she murmured, everyone!

"Goodbye, Mother Michel!" goodbye !

- See you soon ... It is soon said, Mr. Maurice! Soon, for real?

"I promise you, dear friend, and then come to La Cassolette yourself."

'And you, sir,' she said to me, 'when you go for a walk, choose those straw chairs under my fig trees to rest on, that will please me. »

I thanked her again for her white wine which I found very tasty.

“The cellar is full of them; finally you will always find in our small closed a corner of shade to drink, cool.

- Bye Madam.

— Goodbye, Mother Michel. My regards to Victor.

"Without fault, Monsieur Maurice." »Charming hour… The landscape bathed in light, seen from the threshold of this house is captivating, is moving, is good to paint. I'll be back. Yes, I will come back with a canvas and colors.

CHAPTER XLVII
From the lavender notebook.

Daughter of peasants, almost a peasant herself, but (why this stupid “but”?) completely charming. Ah! his conversation is different from that of caillettes, as Maurice used to say, that I saw in the hospital. “Luciana! speak to me of your deplorable abomasums! Me, I was defending them… I had time to waste!

She came to visit us with her son, a delightful child, full of drive, cheerfulness, not shy (perhaps a little shy), clean, discreet, well brought up, well behaved, above all very lively. You can see that he hasn't been deprived of the sun, that one: he hardly resembles a city child. She called him so kindly: "My little man." He found it quite natural; he knew he was a little man, a real little man.

So much seriousness in his ways of speaking, so much conviction! There was no need to treat him like a child; it is singular; one could talk with him; I hear, well: talk. He talked about field work in a way that I really liked. Obviously, he was on his business.

It thrilled Roger, but Maurice quickly took it away from us to take it to his library. This brat is mad about books. So Madame Michel and I went for a walk. What she says is always interesting, what she explains is always clear, what she feels, we feel it too, we feel it with her.

What were we talking about? Oh ! everything: the country, the harvests, the cuts that are made in the woods, the fishing, the studies of little Maurice, of her husband who will be coming before the end of the month on leave and whom I am curious to see.

We couldn't stop chatting, we were confident.

How I would like to have a friend of this kind, so beautiful, so full of health, common sense, charity. No gossip, nothing to whisper or imply; everything could be said clearly. Besides, she couldn't lie: she couldn't. When she speaks of her country, of the beauty of her country, it seems that she wants to sing, we believe that she is going to sing and, if we dared, we would sing with her.

Ms. Michel also told me a lot about her husband whom she adores. He must be a robust and quiet man. They form a happy household. She has confidence in him: what he does is surely well done; what she does is done according to a rule that they have both learned and that dictates their good health, their sense of duty and also that of the pleasure of living… Living like this, how good it must be!

I am moved by this couple more than I can say, the idea of ​​this active and rested life excites me. It seems so natural and yet it is so rare! Since I have known Marie Michel, I believe I understand better the trees, the rocks, the waves of the sea, and I begin to suspect things of which I was completely ignorant.

Marie Michel is intelligent, shrewd, imaginative, but (can I explain this?) within the limits of perfect health. She is often funny and made me laugh heartily, as I hadn't laughed for a long time. I hope to see her often. I'm going to visit her soon and she promised to come back. His friendship for Maurice touches me. They have been linked since childhood. Friendships of this quality are not common.

Roger had a little fever last night. He read very late and didn't turn off his light until three in the morning. Today, what is he dreaming about? He tires of reading; all these books he borrows from Maurice, he goes through them, already knowing them, then, about them, he becomes passionate, he becomes agitated. Fat Emilie was telling the truth when, yesterday, she decreed in that wise and familiar tone that amuses me so much about her: "The sick, you see, madam, they have to stay quieter." The soap operas cloud their brains! »

Roger had a terrible word, perhaps a simple thoughtlessness of no importance, and yet… He had just put a book on his knees (a novel that I haven't read: the Charterhouse of Parma); he was looking up, he was quite absent and I heard him murmur:

"We had fun back then..."

Then, resuming the painful expression which I hate and which I fear, he looked down at me and, surprised that I was so close to him, added, as if I were asking a question:

“What do you want, my little one, I'm bored to death! »

So how does he get bored here?

Evening is falling… Throughout the day, big white clouds have been rolling in the sky; they hid the sun at every moment and cast a great shadow over us. A few seconds later, the landscape was completely golden. We didn't know whether to feel happy or sad. Should we laugh? Should we cry? Cloudy weather is indifferent to me in the North; often he charms me. At La Cassolette, it's something else: I need the sun whenever I don't feel quite happy.

CHAPTER XLVIIII did quite a few portraits. At my beginnings, the landscape especially attracted me, then I wanted to place figures there and it was long after that I attached myself to painting a human expression, but this was, in fact, a serious attachment. It still lasts. Undertaking a portrait is not just a pleasure for me, it's an absorbing duty that I think about all day long, that torments me, that I can't escape from the moment I commit myself to it. Some portraits cost me really painful hours.

I am working on the portrait of Cigogne. The first sketch hardly satisfies me, but I believe that I will overcome the difficulty, which is great when dealing with such a mobile, undulating and diverse face. I don't want to paint him absent; do you understand ? I want it to be there, against the background of trees and sky that I have chosen for it, very present on my canvas. It would certainly be easy to render the appearance of that soft mouth, that slightly wrinkled upper forehead, and those lightless eyes that I still know. I'm looking for something else: a living Stork, lost perhaps in a dream, but in a dream of action.

This project came to me because, last Saturday, I had drawn with three pencils, a small portrait of Mrs. Maxence . Nothing: a fantasy. Started while she was reading to her husband, this portrait was to be, at first, only the rapid indication of a profile that I like for its gravity without anything severe, its finesse without anything sickly and , above all, its reasonable grace… (I can't find another way to describe it), but soon I wanted to go further, because the sketch seemed to me to be carried out according to my desire. The day was very mild, Lucienne posed wonderfully, my pencils didn't give me any unpleasant surprises and I was happy with the paper. Three hours later, I gave Lucienne her finished portrait.

She declared herself very satisfied. The warmth she expressed in thanking me, in shaking my hands, surprised me. She was completely happy, she let it be seen, she expressed it in almost enthusiastic words, very agreeable to my vanity as a painter, but singular to Lucienne. Mahoudiaux also congratulated me: "You have to admit that he draws neatly, the bugger," he declared; this is our friend! Finally, I passed the sheet to Cigogne.

He looked at her without saying anything at first. His eyebrows knit together, his mouth trembled, then he made the following little speech to me, which I reproduced word for word:

“A very pretty thing, certainly, a lovely design, nevertheless… listen, old man, you're not going to get angry, are you, if I allow myself a criticism?… Well, it's Lucienne… without his soul…

- But, for God's sake! I interrupted, I am not a painter of souls! I've already told you a hundred times, Stork!

'Let me explain: it's her and it's not her; it's her when it rains, she's her in gray weather, when she doesn't know what to do and she's bored. It's Lucienne as she would be if she didn't love me, if I no longer loved her.

"Roger!" thank you! she cried.

"It's Lucienne in a herbarium." Yes that's it ! it's Lucienne in a herbarium. You recognize it right away, as if you were reading a label... I don't recognize it. It's not her… "

It was better not to upset him: I could read too much anguish on his face. I apologized, consoled him, made a few jokes, finally promised to try something else.

"Actually, no," I said. Next time I'll try to paint your portrait.

- Oh! how nice ! he muttered with a weak smile.

From the beginning of this piece of eloquence, Mahoudiaux had walked away with a shrug of the shoulders, growling:

“My most sincere compliment, Serval: you have composure! »

But when I looked at Lucienne, I saw that she was crying.

CHAPTER XLIX
The little white wooden table was just as clean, the three glasses full of such tasty wine, the two fig trees just as biblical in appearance, and Madame Michel just as charming. We missed little Maurice once again, because school ends late.

It was a perfect chat. Very much at ease with Mahoudiaux, Ms. Michel laughed, talked about the most serious things, recalled old memories, became passionate about one subject, moved on to another and gave me great pleasure by showing, by her familiar and simple ways , that she took me for someone reliable, a newcomer whom she approved. Mahoudiaux seemed happy with the good camaraderie that reigned between us.

"And now that you've seen them," he asked, "what do you think of Maxence, Mother Michel?" what do you think of his wife? »

She thought for a moment.

“Do you believe, Monsieur Maurice, that people are judged like this? Yes, I saw your two friends, but I only saw them; I don't know them, except perhaps Madame Maxence, who was kind enough to chat with me , so delightfully, so kindly! Ah! here is someone I liked right away, at first sight? His welcome gives confidence. With her, you don't waste time wondering this or that... You know that her heart is good, as if you had put your hand on her chest to feel it beat.

"You are always right, Mother Michel," said Mahoudiaux.

'It's also,' she went on, 'that good hearts are easy to discover, even when they're hiding. Despite themselves, they give warmth, and that feels good.

"And what do you think of her husband?" I asked."I barely saw him, Monsieur Serval: we exchanged twenty words!" I would be sorry to be unjust, so I only want to think of the poor sick man (M. Maurice told me about his accident) who will need to be looked after for a long time, they say. All that I can know of him is through Mme Maxence, and Mme Maxence does not strike me as a happy woman . I'm giving you my impression like that...for what it's worth. You see, happiness is also divined, like kindness, by the warmth of the heart, also by the gaze, and it is even more difficult to hide. We don't even hide it at all. It would be dishonest.

- How do you hear, Madam? I asked.

— It gives pleasure to others who are less happy than you. When a bowl of milk or a glass of wine is offered to this poor man passing by, instead of giving him two sous, the poor man likes that better than the two sous. You invite him a little to your table, it's a way of honoring him by taking away his thirst.

"You are inviting us to your table at this moment, Mother Michel!"

"So, what, Mr. Maurice!...we wouldn't invite his brother and a friend of his brother?"

- Oh! my dear Mary! you have a heart that must be all gold!

'Mr Maurice, you're talking nonsense! … but I'll make no secret of it: I'm happy, very happy. I have a good husband whom I love and who loves me back, a healthy and hard-working little boy, a childhood friend like there aren't many… what more could I ask of the good Lord , since after all I am never sick and we largely earn our living? »

She looked at me smiling.

"Yes, Madame," I replied, "you have the good share."

'I think so, Monsieur Serval, and if Victor comes back from the front not too tired from the last three months of work, I'll be quite certain of getting the good share, as you say.

"When does he arrive?"

— Sunday in eight; more than ten days. Ah! all the same, my heart beats when I think of it, and my little Maurice, this idea drives him mad! "I'm going to see dad again with his second palm!" And he starts running down the road like a goat, to calm himself down; it can no longer stay in place. Besides, his father will be as mad as he is.

"After Victor's job there," said Mahoudiaux, "returning to the country will be a fine return."

— Yes, Monsieur Maurice, when you find your wife, child, friend, it's already a blessed moment, but to find again the country you love!... he will lose his breath when he arrives.

- For a few days you will resume your charming life of yesteryear.

- You can still surprise us, Mr. Maurice, here, both looking at the setting sun ... Ah! look, Victor said to me so amusingly, in one of his letters: “Do you see, my good Marie, in Flanders, the sun does not know how to set! »

- The miserable ! exclaimed Mahoudiaux. Do you hear, Serval?

- Oh! Monsieur Maurice, she went on, don't ask too much of him! be charitable! He doesn't understand those countries where you walk around in the mud all the time. It gives him the blues. So, as he has common sense and reason, he thinks of our country and, little by little, good humor returns… but you won't tell me that the sun in Belgium is as beautiful as in Provence! »

She pointed with a beautiful, quiet gesture to the light on the shore and on the waves, as if to call its brilliance, its splendor to witness, then she continued:

“Yes, under those fig trees we had some lovely evenings, Victor and I. Over there, the red clouds, it was still burning like a furnace, and the night was falling slowly... slowly... Sometimes we stayed like that for hours, and we were very happy. People were driving by; they made noise; we heard them laugh and we also laughed when we thought that our little garden smelled better than their gasoline. Then we also saw vagabonds and I thought of them, and I wondered where they were going with this face they sometimes have: not the faces of beggars, the faces of men happy to live like this, to walk straight ahead of them. , and for a while I wandered off myself and told Victor everything I saw on the road and in that barn by the side of the road, where I was going to sleep… Victor replied that I was crazy: “You're brains are spinning, my dear Marie! But it's so sweet, once the day's work is done, to rest like that, to let yourself be carried away by people passing by, to be those people a bit! You understand, Monsieur Maurice, it wouldn't be allowed if the child was not well slept, the husband's clothes well brushed and sewn up, the linen well washed, the kitchen well in order, but when everything is settled at home , we can go out as we please, we can dream all we want, we can be this person who passes on horseback at a brisk trot or this fisherman who goes out to sea… We can be so many things! so many beautiful things! Ah! Monsieur Serval! you're going to call me crazy, too, but one night when the stars were shining in the absolutely black sky, and we were taking the air here, I really believed, for a moment, that I was one of the shepherds of the olden days, and I was waiting for the star that would lead me to the stable where the baby Jesus would be lying. I assure you ! if there had been in the sky, at that moment, a beautiful luminous star that I did not know, well, that would not have surprised me! »Maurice Mahoudiaux looked at his pipe before cleaning it and said nothing. I wanted to have another explanation from Madame Michel:

"But, Madame," I asked her, "why can one afford such a pleasure only when, according to your own expression, 'everything is settled at home'?"

At first she didn't answer, then, in a voice that was a little shy, a little hesitant:
