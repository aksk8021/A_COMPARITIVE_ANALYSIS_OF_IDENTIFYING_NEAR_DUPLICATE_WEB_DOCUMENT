April 2d, 1865.—Our first Sunday at sea. The weather is delicious, the ship as steady as anything on the water can be, and even the most forlorn of our party have little excuse for sea-sickness. We have had service from Bishop Potter this morning, and since then we have been on deck reading, walking, watching a singular cloud, which the captain says is a cloud of smoke, in the direction of Petersburg. We think it may be the smoke of a great decisive 2engagement going on while we sail peacefully along. What it means, or how the battle ends, if battle it be, we shall not know for two months perhaps.[2] Mr. Agassiz is busy to-day in taking notes, at regular intervals, of the temperature of the water, as we approach the Gulf Stream. To-night we cut it at right angles, and he will remain on deck to continue his observations.

April 3d.—The Professor sat up last night as he intended, and found his watch, which was shared by one or two of his young assistants, very interesting. We crossed the Gulf Stream opposite Cape Hatteras, at a latitude where it is comparatively narrow, some sixty miles only in breadth. Entering it at about six o’clock, we passed out of it a little after midnight. The western boundary of the warm waters stretching along the coast had a temperature of about 57°. Immediately after entering it, the temperature began to rise gradually, the maximum being about 74°, falling occasionally, however, when we passed through a cold streak, to 68°. These cold streaks in the Gulf Stream, which reach to a considerable depth, the warm and cold waters descending together in immediate contact for at least a hundred fathoms, are attributed by Dr. Bache to the fact that the Gulf Stream is not stationary. It sways as a whole sometimes a little toward the shore, sometimes a little away from it, and, in consequence of this, the colder water from the coast creeps in, forming these vertical layers in its midst. The eastern boundary is warmer 3than the western one, for the latter is chilled by the Arctic currents, which form a band of cold water all along the Atlantic shore. Their influence is felt nearly to the latitude of Florida. On coming out of the Gulf Stream the temperature of the water was 68°, and so it continued for an hour longer, after which Mr. Agassiz ceased his observations. To-day some of the gulf-weed was gathered by a sailor, and we found it crowded with life. Hydroids, in numbers, had their home upon it; the delicate branching plumularia and a pretty campanularia, very like some of our New England species; beside these, bryozoa, tiny compound mollusks, crusted its stem, and barnacles were abundant upon it. These are all the wonders that the deep has yielded us to-day, though the pretty Portuguese men-of-war go floating by the vessel, out of reach thus far. Such are the events of our life: we eat and drink and sleep, read, study Portuguese, and write up our journals.

April 4th.—It has occurred to Mr. Agassiz, as a means of preparing the young men who accompany him for the work before them, to give a course of lectures on ship-board. Some preparation of the kind is the more necessary, since much of the work must be done independently of him, as it will be impossible for so large a party to travel together; and the instructions needed will be more easily given in a daily lecture to all, than in separate conversations with each one singly. The idea finds general favor. The large saloon makes an excellent lecture-room; a couple of leaves from the dining-table with a black oil-cloth stretched across them serve as a blackboard. The audience consists, not only of our own company, but includes the few ladies who are on board, Mr. Bradbury, the captain of our steamer, Bishop Potter, some of the ship’s officers, 4and a few additional passengers, all of whom seem to think the lecture a pleasant break in the monotony of a sea voyage. To-day the subject was naturally suggested by the seaweeds of the Gulf Stream, so recently caught and so crowded with life,—“A lecture on the Gulf Stream in the Gulf Stream,” as one of the listeners suggests. It was opened, however, by a few words on the exceptional character of the position of this scientific commission on board the Colorado.

“Fifty years ago, when naturalists carried their investigations to distant lands, either government was obliged to provide an expensive outfit for them, or, if they had no such patronage, scanty opportunities grudgingly given might be granted them on ordinary conveyances. Even if such accommodation were allowed them, their presence was looked upon as a nuisance: no general interest was felt in their objects; it was much if they were permitted, on board some vessel, to have their bucket of specimens in a corner, which any sailor might kick over, unreproved, if it chanced to stand in his way. This ship, and the spirit prevailing in her command, opens to me a vista such as I never dreamed of till I stood upon her deck. Here, in place of the meagre chances I remember in old times, the facilities could hardly be greater if the ship had been built as a scientific laboratory. If any such occasion has ever been known before, if any naturalist has ever been treated with such consideration, and found such intelligent appreciation of his highest aims, on board a merchant-ship fitted up for purposes of trade, I am not aware of it. I hope the first trip of the Colorado will be remembered in the annals of science. I, at least, shall know whom to thank for an opportunity so unique. This voyage, and the circumstances connected with it, are, to me, the signs of a good time coming; when men of different interests 5will help each other; when naturalists will be more liberal and sailors more cultivated, and natural science and navigation will work hand in hand. And now for my lecture,—my first lecture on ship-board.”

The lecture was given, of course, specimen in hand, the various inhabitants of the branch of seaweed giving their evidence in succession of their own structure and way of life. To these living illustrations were added drawings on the blackboard to show the transformations of the animals, their embryological history, &c.[3] Since the lecture, Captain Bradbury has fitted up a large tank as an aquarium, where any specimens taken during the voyage may be preserved and examined. Mr. Agassiz is perfectly happy, enjoying every hour of the voyage, as well he may, surrounded as he is with such considerate kindness.

April 6th.—Though I took notes, as usual, of the lecture yesterday, I had not energy enough to enter them in my journal. The subject was the Gulf Stream,—the stream itself this time, not the animals it carries along with it. Mr. Agassiz’s late observations, though deeply interesting to himself, inasmuch as personal confirmation of facts already known is always satisfactory, have nothing novel now-a-days; yet the history of the facts connected with the discovery of the Gulf Stream, and their gradual development, is always attractive, and especially so to Americans, on account of its direct connection with scientific investigations 6carried on under our government. Mr. Agassiz gave a slight sketch of this in opening his lecture. “It was Franklin who first systematically observed these facts, though they had been noticed long before by navigators. He recorded the temperature of the water as he left the American continent for Europe, and found that it continued cold for a certain distance, then rose suddenly, and after a given time sank again to a lower temperature, though not so low as before. With the comprehensive grasp of mind characteristic of all his scientific results, he went at once beyond his facts. He inferred that the warm current, keeping its way so steadily through the broad Atlantic, and carrying tropical productions to the northern shores of Europe, must take its rise in tropical regions, must be heated by a tropical sun.[4] This was his inference: to work it out, to ascertain the origin and course of the Gulf Stream, has been, in a great degree, the task of the United States Coast Survey, under the direction of his descendant, Dr. Bache.”[5]

7We are now fairly in the tropics. “The trades” blow heavily, and yesterday was a dreary day for those unused to the ocean; the beautiful blue water, of a peculiar metallic tint, as remarkable in color, it seemed to me, as the water of the Lake of Geneva, did not console us for the heavy moral and physical depression of sea-sick mortals. To-day the world looks brighter; there is a good deal of motion, but we are more accustomed to it. This morning the lecture had, for the first time, a direct bearing upon the work of the expedition. The subject was, “How to observe, and what are the objects of scientific explorations in modern times.”

“My companions and myself have come together so suddenly and so unexpectedly on our present errand, that we have had little time to organize our work. The laying out of a general scheme of operations is, therefore, the first and one of the most important points to be discussed between us. The time for great discoveries is passed. No student of nature goes out now expecting to find a new world, or looks in the heavens for any new theory of the solar system. The work of the naturalist, in our day, is to explore worlds the existence of which is already known; to investigate, not to discover. The first explorers, in this modern sense, were Humboldt in the physical world, Cuvier in natural history, Lavoisier in chemistry, La Place in astronomy. They have been the pioneers in the kind of scientific work characteristic of our century. We who have chosen Brazil as our field must seek to make ourselves familiar with its physical features, its mountains and its rivers, its animals and plants. There is a change, however, to be introduced 8in our mode of work, as compared with that of former investigators. When less was known of animals and plants the discovery of new species was the great object. This has been carried too far, and is now almost the lowest kind of scientific work. The discovery of a new species as such does not change a feature in the science of natural history, any more than the discovery of a new asteroid changes the character of the problems to be investigated by astronomers. It is merely adding to the enumeration of objects. We should look rather for the fundamental relations among animals; the number of species we may find is of importance only so far as they explain the distribution and limitation of different genera and families, their relations to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live. Out of such investigations there looms up a deeper question for scientific men, the solution of which is to be the most important result of their work in coming generations. The origin of life is the great question of the day. How did the organic world come to be as it is? It must be our aim to throw some light on this subject by our present journey. How did Brazil come to be inhabited by the animals and plants now living there? Who were its inhabitants in past times? What reason is there to believe that the present condition of things in this country is in any sense derived from the past? The first step in this investigation must be to ascertain the geographical distribution of the present animals and plants. Suppose we first examine the Rio San Francisco. The basin of this river is entirely isolated. Are its inhabitants, like its waters, completely distinct from those of other basins? Are its species peculiar to itself, and not repeated in any other river of the continent? Extraordinary as this result would seem, 9I nevertheless expect to find it so. The next water-basin we shall have to examine will be that of the Amazons, which connects through the Rio Negro with the Orinoco. It has been frequently repeated that the same species of fish exist in the waters of the San Francisco and in those of Guiana and of the Amazons. At all events, our works on fishes constantly indicate Brazil and Guiana as the common home of many species; but this observation has never been made with sufficient accuracy to merit confidence. Fifty years ago the exact locality from which any animal came seemed an unimportant fact in its scientific history, for the bearing of this question on that of origin was not then perceived. To say that any specimen came from South America was quite enough; to specify that it came from Brazil, from the Amazons, the San Francisco, or the La Plata, seemed a marvellous accuracy in the observers. In the museum at Paris, for instance, there are many specimens entered as coming from New York or from Pará; but all that is absolutely known about them is that they were shipped from those sea-ports. Nobody knows exactly where they were collected. So there are specimens entered as coming from the Rio San Francisco, but it is by no means sure that they came exclusively from that water-basin. All this kind of investigation is far too loose for our present object. Our work must be done with much more precision; it must tell something positive of the geographical distribution of animals in Brazil. Therefore, my young friends who come with me on this expedition, let us be careful that every specimen has a label, recording locality and date, so secured that it shall reach Cambridge safely. It would be still better to attach two labels to each specimen, so that, if any mischance happens 10to one, our record may not be lost. We must try not to mix the fishes of different rivers, even though they flow into each other, but to keep our collections perfectly distinct. You will easily see the vast importance of thus ascertaining the limitation of species, and the bearing of the result on the great question of origin.

“Something is already known. It is ascertained that the South American rivers possess some fishes peculiar to them. Were these fishes then created in these separate water-systems as they now exist, or have they been transferred thither from some other water-bed? If not born there, how did they come there? Is there, or has there ever been, any possible connection between these water-systems? Are their characteristic species repeated elsewhere? Thus we narrow the boundaries of the investigation, and bring it, by successive approaches, nearer the ultimate question. But the first inquiry is, How far are species distinct all over the world, and what are their limits? Till this is ascertained, all theories about their origin, their derivation from one another, their successive transformation, their migration from given centres, and so on, are mere beating about the bush. I allude especially to the fresh-water fishes, in connection with this investigation, on account of the precision of their boundaries. Looking at the matter theoretically, without a positive investigation, I do not expect to find a single species of the Lower Amazons above Tabatinga.[6] I base this supposition upon my own observations 11respecting the distribution of species in the European rivers. I have found that, while some species occur simultaneously in the many upper water-courses which combine to form the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Danube, most of them are not found in the lower course of these rivers; that, again, certain species are found in two of these water-basins and do not occur in the third, or inhabit only one and are not to be met in the two others. The brook trout, for instance (Salmo Fario), is common to the upper course and the higher tributaries of all the three river-systems, but does not inhabit the main bed of their lower course. So it is, also, and in a more striking degree, with the Salmling (Salmo Salvelinus). The Huchen (Salmo Hucho) is only found in the Danube. But the distribution of the perch family in these rivers is, perhaps, the most remarkable. The Zingel (Aspro Zingel) and the Schrætzer (Acerina Schrætzer) are only found in the Danube; while Acerina cernua is found in the Danube as well as in the Rhine, but not in the Rhone; and Aspro asper in the Danube as well as in the Rhone, but not in the Rhine. The Sander (Lucioperca Sandra) is found in the Danube and the other large rivers of Eastern Europe, but occurs neither in the Rhine nor in the Rhone. The common perch (Perca fluviatilis), on the contrary, is found both in the Rhine and Rhone, but not in the Danube, which, however, nourishes another species of true Perca, already described by Schaeffer as Perca vulgaris. Again, the pickerel (Esox Lucius) is common to all these rivers, especially in their lower course, and so is also the cusk (Lota vulgaris). The special distribution 12of the carp family would afford many other striking examples, but they are too numerous and too little known to be used as an illustration here.

“This is among the most remarkable instances of what I would call the arbitrary character of geographical distribution. Such facts cannot be explained by any theory of accidental dispersion, for the upper mountain rivulets, in which these great rivers take their rise, have no connection with each other; nor can any local circumstance explain the presence of some species in all the three basins, while others appear only in one, or perhaps in two, and are absent from the third, or the fact that certain species inhabiting the head-waters of these streams are never found in their lower course when the descent would seem so natural and so easy. In the absence of any positive explanation, we are left to assume that the distribution of animal life has primary laws as definite and precise as those which govern anything else in the system of the universe.

“It is for the sake of investigations of this kind that I wish our party to divide, in order that we may cover as wide a ground as possible, and compare a greater number of the water-basins of Brazil. I wish the same to be done, as far as may be, for all the classes of Vertebrates, as well as for Mollusks, Articulates, and Radiates. As we have no special botanist in the party, we must be content to make a methodical collection of the most characteristic families of trees, such as the palms and tree ferns. A collection of the stems of these trees would be especially important as a guide to the identification of fossil woods. Much more is known of the geographical distribution of plants than of animals, however, and there is, therefore, less to be done that is new in that direction.

13“Our next aim, and with the same object, namely, its bearing upon the question of origin, will be the study of the young, the collecting of eggs and embryos. This is the more important, since museums generally show only adult specimens. As far as I know, the Zoölogical Museum at Cambridge is the only one containing large collections of embryological specimens from all the classes of the animal kingdom. One significant fact, however, is already known. In their earliest stages of growth all animals of the same class are much more alike than in their adult condition, and sometimes so nearly alike as hardly to be distinguished. Indeed, there is an early period when the resemblances greatly outweigh the differences. How far the representatives of different classes resemble one another remains to be ascertained with precision. There are two possible interpretations of these facts. One is that animals so nearly identical in the beginning must have been originally derived from one germ, and are but modifications or transmutations, under various physical conditions, of this primitive unit. The other interpretation, founded on the same facts, is, that since, notwithstanding this material identity in the beginning, no germ ever grows to be different from its parent, or diverges from the pattern imposed upon it at its birth, therefore some other cause besides a material one must control its development; and if this be so, we have to seek an explanation of the differences between animals outside of physical influences. Thus far both these views rest chiefly upon personal convictions and opinions. The true solution of the problem must be sought in the study of the development of the animals themselves, and embryology is still in its infancy; for, though a very complete study of the embryology of a few animals has been made, 14yet these investigations include so small a number of representatives from the different classes of the animal kingdom that they do not yet give a basis for broad generalizations. Very little is known of the earlier stages in the formation of hosts of insects whose later metamorphoses, including the change of the already advanced larva, first to the condition of a chrysalis and then to that of a perfect insect, have been carefully traced. It remains to be ascertained to what extent the caterpillars of different kinds of butterflies, for instance, resemble one another during the time of their formation in the egg. An immense field of observation is open in this order alone.

“I have, myself, examined over one hundred species of bird embryos, now put up in the museum of Cambridge, and found that, at a certain age, they all have bills, wings, legs, feet, &c., &c. exactly alike. The young robin and the young crow are web-footed, as well as the duck. It is only later that the fingers of the foot become distinct. How very interesting it will be to continue this investigation among the tropical birds!—to see whether, for instance, the toucan, with its gigantic bill, has, at a certain age, a bill like that of all other birds; whether the spoonbill ibis has, at the same age, nothing characteristic in the shape of its bill. No living naturalist could now tell you one word about all this; neither could he give you any information about corresponding facts in the growth of the fishes, reptiles, or quadrupeds of Brazil, not one of the young of these animals having ever been compared with the adult. In these lectures I only aim at showing you what an extensive and interesting field of investigation opens before us; if we succeed in cultivating even a few corners of it we shall be fortunate.”

15In the evening, which is always the most enjoyable part of our day, we sat on the guards and watched the first tropical sunset we had yet seen. The sun went down in purple and gold, and, after its departure, sent back a glow that crimsoned the clouds almost to the zenith, dying off to paler rose tints on the edges, while heavy masses of gray vapor, just beginning to be silvered by the moon, swept up from the south.

April 7th.—To-day the lecture was upon the physical features of South America, something with reference to the geological and geographical work in which Mr. Agassiz hopes to have efficient aid from his younger assistants. So much of the lecture consisted of explanations given upon geological maps that it is difficult to record it. Its principal object, however, was to show in what direction they should work in order to give greater precision to the general information already secured respecting the formation of the continent. “The basin of the Amazons, for instance, is a level plain. The whole of it is covered with loose materials. We must watch carefully the character of these loose materials, and try to track them to their origin. As there are very characteristic rocks in various parts of this plain, we shall have a clew to the nature of at least some portion of these materials. My own previous studies have given me a special interest in certain questions connected with these facts. What power has ground up these loose materials? Are they the result of disintegration of the rock by ordinary atmospheric agents, or are they caused by the action of water, or by that of glaciers? Was there ever a time when large masses of ice descended far lower than the present snow line of the Andes, and, moving over the low lands, ground these 16materials to powder? We know that such an agency has been at work on the northern half of this hemisphere. We have now to look for its traces on the southern half, where no such investigations have ever been made within its warm latitudes; though to Darwin science is already indebted for much valuable information concerning the glacial phenomena of the temperate and colder portions of the South American continent. We should examine the loose materials in every river we ascend, and see what relation they bear to the dry land above. The color of the water in connection with the nature of the banks will tell us something. The waters of the Rio Branco, for instance, are said to be milky white; those of the Rio Negro, black. In the latter case the color is probably owing to the decomposition of vegetation. I would advise each one of our parties to pass a large amount of water from any river or stream along which they travel through a filter, and to examine the deposit microscopically. They will thus ascertain the character of the detritus, whether from sand, or lime, or granite, or mere river mud formed by the decomposition of organic matter. Even the smaller streams and rivulets will have their peculiar character. The Brazilian table-land rises to a broad ridge running from west to east, and determining the direction of the rivers. It is usually represented as a mountain range, but is in fact nothing but a high flat ridge serving as a water-shed, and cut transversely by deep fissures in which the rivers flow. These fissures are broad in their lower parts, but little is known of their upper range; and whoever will examine their banks carefully will do an important work for science. Indeed, very little is known accurately of the geology of Brazil. On the geological maps almost the whole country is represented as consisting of granite. 17If this be correct, it is very inconsistent with what we know of the geological structure of other continents, where the stratified rocks are in much larger proportions.”

Upon this followed some account of the different kinds of valley formation and of terraces. “Do the old terraces above the rivers of South America correspond to the river terraces on any of our rivers,—those of the Connecticut, for instance,—showing that their waters had formerly a much greater depth and covered a much wider bottom? There must of course have been a cause for this great accumulation of water in ancient periods. I account for it in the northern half of the hemisphere by the melting of vast masses of ice in the glacial period, causing immense freshets. There is no trustworthy account of the river terraces in Brazil. Bates, however, describes flat-topped hills between Santarem and Pará in the narrow part of the valley, near Almeyrim, rising 800 feet above the present level of the Amazons. If this part of the valley were flooded in old times, banks might have been formed of which these hills are a remnant. But because such a theory might account for the facts it does not follow that the theory is true. Our work must be to study the facts, to see, among other things, of what these hills are built, whether of rock or of loose materials. No one has told us anything as yet of their geological constitution.”[7]

To-day we have seen numbers of flying-fish from the deck, and were astonished at the grace and beauty of their motion, which we had supposed to be rather a leap than actual flight. And flight indeed it is not, their pectoral 18fins acting as sails rather than wings, and carrying them along on the wind. They skim over the water in this way to a great distance. Captain Bradbury told us he had followed one with his glass and lost sight of it at a considerable distance, without seeing it dip into the water again. Mr. Agassiz has great delight in watching them.[8] Having never before sailed in tropical seas, he enjoys every day some new pleasure.

April 9th.—Yesterday Mr. Agassiz lectured upon the traces of glaciers as they exist in the northern hemisphere, and the signs of the same kind to be sought for in Brazil. After a sketch of what has been done in glacial investigation in Europe and the United States, showing the great extension of ice over these regions in ancient times, he continued as follows: “When the polar half of both hemispheres was covered by such an ice shroud, the climate of the whole earth must have been different from what it is now. The limits of the ancient glaciers give us some estimate of this difference, though of course only an approximate one. A degree of temperature in the annual average of any given locality corresponds to a degree of latitude; that is, a degree of temperature is lost for every degree of latitude as we travel northward, or gained for every degree of latitude as we travel southward. In our times, the line at which the average annual temperature is 32°, that is, at which glaciers may be formed, is in latitude 60° or thereabouts, the latitude of Greenland; while the height at which they may originate in latitude 45° is about 6,000 feet. If it appear that the ancient southern limit of glaciers is in latitude 36°, we must admit that in those days the present climate of Greenland extended to that line. Such a change of climate with 19reference to latitude must have been attended by a corresponding change of climate with reference to altitude. Three degrees of temperature correspond to about one thousand feet of altitude. If, therefore, it is found that the ancient limit of glacier action descends on the Andes, for instance, to 7,000 feet above the level of the sea under the equator, the present line of perpetual snow being at 15,000, it is safe to infer that in those days the climate was some 24° or thereabouts below its present temperature. That is, the temperature of the present snow line then prevailed at a height of 7,000 feet above the sea level, as the present average temperature of Greenland then prevailed in latitude 36°. I am as confident that we shall find these indications at about the limit I have pointed out as if I had already seen them. I would even venture to prophesy that the first moraines in the valley of the Marañon should be found where it bends eastward above Jaen.”[9]

Although the weather is fine, the motion of the ship continues to be so great that those of us who have not what are popularly called “sea-legs,” have much ado to keep our balance. For my own part, I am beginning to feel a personal animosity to “the trades.” I had imagined them to be soft, genial breezes wafting us gently southward; instead of which they blow dead ahead all the time, and give us no rest night or day. And yet we are very unreasonable to grumble; for never were greater comforts and conveniences 20provided for voyagers on the great deep than are to be found on this magnificent ship. The state-rooms large and commodious, parlor and dining-hall well ventilated, cool, and cheerful, the decks long and broad enough to give a chance for extensive “constitutionals” to everybody who can stand upright for two minutes together, the attendance punctual and admirable in every respect; in short, nothing is left to be desired except a little more stable footing.

April 10th.—A rough sea to-day, notwithstanding which we had our lecture as usual, though I must say, that, owing to the lurching of the ship, the lecturer pitched about more than was consistent with the dignity of science. Mr. Agassiz returned to the subject of embryology, urging upon his assistants the importance of collecting materials for this object as a means of obtaining an insight into the deeper relations between animals.

“Heretofore classification has been arbitrary, inasmuch as it has rested mainly upon the interpretation given to structural differences by various observers, who did not measure the character and value of these differences by any natural standard. I believe that we have a more certain guide in these matters than opinion or the individual estimate of any observer, however keen his insight into structural differences. The true principle of classification exists in Nature herself, and we have only to decipher it. If this conviction be correct, the next question is, How can we make this principle a practical one in our laboratories, an active stimulus in our investigations? Is it susceptible of positive demonstration in material facts? Is there any method to be adopted as a correct guide, if we set aside the idea of originating systems of classification of our own, and seek only to read that already written in 21nature? I answer, Yes. The standard is to be found in the changes animals undergo from their first formation in the egg to their adult condition.

“It would be impossible for me here and now to give you the details of this method of investigation, but I can tell you enough to illustrate my statement. Take a homely and very familiar example, that of the branch of Articulates. Naturalists divide this branch into three classes,—Insects, Crustacea, and Worms; and most of them tell you that Worms are lowest, Crustacea next in rank, and that Insects stand highest, while others have placed the Crustacea at the head of the group. We may well ask why. Why does an insect stand above a crustacean, or, vice versa, why is a grasshopper or a butterfly structurally superior to a lobster or a shrimp? And indeed there must be a difference in opinion as to the respective standing of these groups so long as their classification is allowed to remain a purely arbitrary one, based only upon interpretation of anatomical details. One man thinks the structural features of Insects superior, and places them highest; another thinks the structural features of the Crustacea highest, and places them at the head. In either case it is only a question of individual appreciation of the facts. But when we study the gradual development of the insect, and find that in its earliest stages it is worm-like, in its second, or chrysalis stage, it is crustacean-like, and only in its final completion it assumes the character of a perfect insect, we have a simple natural scale by which to estimate the comparative rank of these animals. Since we cannot suppose that there is a retrograde movement in the development of any animal, we must believe that the insect stands highest, and our classification in this instance is dictated by Nature herself. This is one of the 22most striking examples, but there are others quite as much so, though not as familiar. The frog, for instance, in its successive stages of development, illustrates the comparative standing of the orders composing the class to which it belongs. These orders are differently classified by various naturalists, according to their individual estimate of their structural features. But the growth of the frog, like that of the insects, gives us the true grade of the type.[10] There are not many groups in which this comparison has been carried out so fully as in the insects and frogs; but wherever it has been tried it is found to be a perfectly sure test. Occasional glimpses of these facts, seen disconnectedly, have done much to confirm the development theory, so greatly in vogue at present, though under a somewhat new form. Those who sustain these views have seen that there was a gradation between animals, and have inferred that it was a material connection. But when we follow it in the growth of the animals themselves, and find that, close as it is, no animal ever misses its true development, or grows to be anything but what it was meant to be, we are forced to 23admit that the gradation which unquestionably unites all animals is an intellectual, not a material one. It exists in the Mind which made them. As the works of a human intellect are bound together by mental kinship, so are the thoughts of the Creator spiritually united. I think that considerations like these should be an inducement for us all to collect the young of as many animals as possible on this journey. In so doing we may change the fundamental principles of classification, and confer a lasting benefit on science.

“It is very important to select the right animals for such investigations. I can conceive that a lifetime should be passed in embryological studies, and yet little be learned of the principles of classification. The embryology of the worm, for instance, would not give us the natural classification of the Articulates, because we should see only the first step of the series; we should not reach the sequence of the development. It would be like reading over and over again the first chapter of a story. The embryology of the Insects, on the contrary, would give us the whole succession of a scale on the lowest level of which the Worms remain forever. So the embryology of the frog will give us the classification of the group to which it belongs, but the embryology of the Cecilia, the lowest order in the group, will give us only the initiatory steps. In the same way the naturalist who, in studying the embryology of the reptiles, should begin with their lowest representatives, the serpents, would make a great mistake. But take the alligator, so abundant in the regions to which we are going. An alligator’s egg in the earliest condition of growth has never been opened by a naturalist. The young have been occasionally taken from the egg just before hatching, but absolutely nothing is known 24of their first phases of development. A complete embryology of the alligator would give us not only the natural classification of reptiles as they exist now, but might teach us something of their history from the time of their introduction upon earth to the present day. For embryology shows us not only the relations of existing animals to each other, but their relations to extinct types also. One prominent result of embryological studies has been to show that animals in the earlier stages of their growth resemble ancient representatives of the same type belonging to past geological ages. The first reptiles were introduced in the carboniferous epoch, and they were very different from those now existing. They were not numerous at that period; but later in the world’s history there was a time, justly called the ‘age of reptiles,’ when the gigantic Saurians, Plesiosaurians, and Ichthyosaurians abounded. I believe, and my conviction is drawn from my previous embryological studies, that the changes of the alligator in the egg will give us the clew to the structural relations of the Reptiles from their first creation to the present day,—will give us, in other words, their sequence in time as well as their sequence in growth. In the class of Reptiles, then, the most instructive group we can select with reference to the structural relations of the type as it now exists, and their history in past times, will be the alligator. We must therefore neglect no opportunity of collecting their eggs in as large numbers as possible.

“There are other animals in Brazil, low in their class to be sure, but yet very important to study embryologically, on account of their relation to extinct types. These are the sloths and armadillos,—animals of insignificant size in our days, but anciently represented in gigantic proportions. The Megatherium, the Mylodon, the Megalonyx, were some 25of these immense Mammalia. I believe that the embryonic changes of the sloths and armadillos will explain the structural relations of those huge Edentata and their connection with the present ones. South America teems with the fossil bones of these animals, which indeed penetrated into the northern half of the hemisphere as high up as Georgia and Kentucky, where their remains have been found. The living representatives of the family are also numerous in South America, and we should make it one of our chief objects to get specimens of all ages and examine them from their earliest phases upward. We must, above all, try not to be led away from the more important aims of our study by the diversity of objects. I have known many young naturalists to miss the highest success by trying to cover too much ground,—by becoming collectors rather than investigators. Bitten by the mania for amassing a great number and variety of species, such a man never returns to the general consideration of more comprehensive features. We must try to set before ourselves certain important questions, and give ourselves resolutely to the investigation of these points, even though we should sacrifice less important things more readily reached.

“Another type full of interest, from an embryological point of view, will be the Monkeys. Since some of our scientific colleagues look upon them as our ancestors, it is important that we should collect as many facts as possible concerning their growth. Of course it would be better if we could make the investigation in the land of the Orangs, Gorillas, and Chimpanzees,—the highest monkeys and the nearest to man in their development. Still even the process of growth in the South American monkey will be very instructive. Give a mathematician the initial elements of a series, and 26he will work out the whole; and so I believe when the laws of embryological development are better understood, naturalists will have a key to the limits of these cycles of growth, and be able to appoint them their natural boundaries even from partial data.
