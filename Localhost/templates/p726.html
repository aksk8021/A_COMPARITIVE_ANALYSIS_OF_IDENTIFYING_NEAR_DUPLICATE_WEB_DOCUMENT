What a pitiful voice of a sick child being harassed! I immediately resumed:

" Oh ! my poor old man, we named you that because you were skinny and so often stood perched on one leg, like storks do, so…”

I will say no more: Mme Maxence was laughing.

" Ah yes ! Ah yes ! it's true ; I did not see, I did not understand. I've noticed it more than once at home: one leg bent, the other quite straight, just like storks… You see them on postcards. »

She laughed heartily.

'Excuse me, sir,' she added, 'I forgot about it! »

And changing the subject, she asked me with a friendly and serious air:

“Will you be bedridden for long?

So we talked about me.

CHAPTER XXXIX
I was soon able to get up and drag my aching leg around the room, then go down to the garden and watch, in the large company of the crippled, the sick, the crippled, the impertinent sparrows. Every day, at visiting hours, I found my new friends near Stork's bed, each time with pleasure. A few one-to-one talks enabled me to explain to Madame Maxence the exasperating effect the war had had on her husband's nervous mind, and I realized that she was grateful to me. Despite the scoldings of the wise Mahoudiaux, the poor little girl thought her dear Roger was already mad.

Time passed and they had just discharged me for good, when, returning from a visit to the Cigogne hospital, I was accosted by Mahoudiaux.

“Tell me, Serval! When you get back home, to Paris where I also plan to go, would you mind if I accompanied you one day to your studio?

"All the less so, my dear friend," I replied, "that I could thus show you the engravings of which I spoke to you?"

- Perfect ! You will also take me out of your boxes the caricatures and sketches you have of our friend Cigogne. See! I won't give it another name… But I want to talk to you about another subject, about an idea that I had… (it happens to me!) and which is dear to me. »

He explained it to me all the way through. "Faith! I ended up subscribing to it.

“You don't know the pleasure you give me, Serval! »

Mahoudiaux speaks in a pleasant way, his sentences do not catch: all round, they roll and bounce.

He owns in the South, around Hyères, a countryside which comes from his family and which he calls “La Cassolette”. Before the war, he went there every year, now he wants to take Cigogne and Mme Maxence there , Cigogne needing a rest and his wife respite, after so many days in the hospital, but Mahoudiaux wants me to be part of it.

“I absolutely want it. You too need a long rest, but I promise you, delicious air there, deck chairs on a terrace, with climbing roses along the wall, yes, my dear! a temperature that will please you since you are not afraid of the heat, a sun like we don't see anymore and, in front of your window, a charming landscape: the Pesquiers pond, Giens and the two gulfs, all of this in luminous tones prepared for a painter. La Cassolette was bought by my great-grandparents and still retains its appearance of an old Provençal house. It's a “mas” (does this word mean anything to you?) You will take something to work with; you will clothe the sun, my sun! And... but it's indecent to brag about your wares like that. I am silent. Do not make sentences and come. »

I was about to open my mouth to answer when he resumed:

“No, I am not silent. There are other pleasures for you at La Cassolette, those that crown a good deed. If you don't come to me for pleasure, you will come here for charity. Cigogne needs you: Lucienne, even more. Listen. This big madman, I love him like a brother, but he is of the terrible race of people who sow misfortune around them, without wanting to, who distribute it with both hands, with beautiful broad gestures! Lucienne, the poor kid, lived an abominable life in the absence of her husband, abominable, you hear! with that calm air and that very wise mouth that you saw in him. He wrote letters (I've read a few of them) that would drive anyone in their right mind. Well, I believe you have an excellent influence on Roger. You have proven it. Lucienne was not at first of this opinion, but women, it's nonsense with pleasure. I'm afraid to be alone with him. There is no other way to put it; I'm afraid ! I wouldn't get away with it. He would set off on a new track, at random, as he always did, and then, to catch up with him, the bugger! Sometimes Lucienne no longer recognizes him. He is so changed!... Or perhaps he imagines it, which comes to the same thing... Come and spend a few weeks with me, Serval; you will retain your beneficent mastery over Roger, you will help me find him, for I am losing him too, in short you will take away his wife's nightmare. Come to the Cassolette, Serval! as he has always done, and then, to catch up with him, the bugger! Sometimes Lucienne no longer recognizes him. He is so changed!... Or perhaps he imagines it, which comes to the same thing... Come and spend a few weeks with me, Serval; you will retain your beneficent mastery over Roger, you will help me find him, for I am losing him too, in short you will take away his wife's nightmare. Come to the Cassolette, Serval! as he has always done, and then, to catch up with him, the bugger! Sometimes Lucienne no longer recognizes him. He is so changed!... Or perhaps he imagines it, which comes to the same thing... Come and spend a few weeks with me, Serval; you will retain your beneficent mastery over Roger, you will help me find him, for I am losing him too, in short you will take away his wife's nightmare. Come to the Cassolette, Serval!

- Deal concluded! " I said.

What else could I say?

CHAPTER XL
From the lavender notebook.

The world is better than it seems. This is an almost daily thought for me, since I visit Roger every day. He starts to get up; we walk in the garden of the hospital, with small steps, (he will always limp, the poor boy!) I chat with him, we evoke our old memories, so dear, we talk about the past and this past I think I see it again , I find Roger as he once was.

I was wrong, I have to admit. His absence has made me unfair. These sentences which made me suffer, he would have explained them to me by means of a few other sentences, with that accent so tender as he speaks to me; written, they kept all their bad looks until they seemed wicked and wickedly intended. They were just blunders. If he had been there, he would have said to me: “Lucienne, my darling, it was just a clumsiness! How not to be convinced?... And the painful impression would have disappeared immediately.

This long separation has changed me. I am no longer as I once was… Have I become clumsy too? Still it is necessary that Roger does not notice it, does not suffer from it! For a year, the smallest thing, the most futile served to exalt me. Am I a child! One example among a thousand: this nickname that his comrades had given to Roger: Stork, as I understand it well, today! Cigogne, it's very simple… a perched position that Roger often took… Ah! I remember, in front of the fireplace, at home, so many times! Stork… a quick sketch in the Japanese way… M. Serval could have done it. Besides, I almost said unpleasant things to Mr. Serval because he called my husband Cigogne! I remembered his letter!

Ah! Mr Serval! I really misjudged it! A good boy who even seems to have good taste and who certainly likes us. Her way of talking to Roger is touching. This does not prevent that I was ready to hate him! Mahoudiaux once told me that, when they put their heart into it, most women become nonsense. He was perhaps speaking for me… He was certainly not speaking at random. I am curious to see M. Serval's painting. He told me he did portraits. And then also, he is very modest; he speaks like everyone else.The day before yesterday, we talked about that ridiculous watercolor that Roger loved so much and that he had me photograph. Ridiculous… no, all the same. We were, Mr. Serval and I, of the same opinion: pretty thing, not very original, too sought after, but showing talent. Roger had named her Florimonde. This is the character in the watercolor that Roger had named Florimonde. M. Serval burst out laughing as he told me. And I who thought it was a name that Roger gave me, me! to me ! I was desperate. I probably talk about it in this notebook… Yes, absence is a terrible ordeal that I should have endured better.

A Mahoudiaux project keeps us very busy. This dear Maurice does not know what to invent to amuse and entertain his friends. He wants us all to go to La Cassolette, Roger and I, him and M. Serval. It would be exquisite, it tempts me, especially at this time. It will be warm, we can rest, contemplate the sea, breathe in the shade of the pines, listen to the wind and the birds (because there are nightingales), finally take a walk, in the evening, under the stars.

Before the war, Maurice had already invited us to "la Cassolette" very often, but then the countryside bored Roger. We didn't go there. This time, Roger hesitates, he does not say no. When he asked me my opinion, I replied that I saw no inconvenience and that, for my part, I was very pleased with it.

Oh ! no longer see those sad houses and all those things that are not from my country; all this grey, all these very fine but somewhat dull tones. I remember Algiers dreaming of “la Cassolette”. It was so beautiful! it will be something similar. I'll sleep in the sun, as I used to, under a big white parasol, and Roger, quiet, too, will dream of me. Another day, if Mr. Serval goes to work...

I would be delighted if a good painter painted my portrait against the background of a real landscape, full of light.

CHAPTER XLI
A letter from Stork:

“So we are going to spend a few weeks together, my old Serval! I'm happy, for sure! You don't doubt it, I hope? But, all the same, admit that it's not fun to find yourself like this, and that we could have imagined happier circumstances without going to great lengths. What do you want ! destiny is a cantankerous old maid who plays patience: she meticulously arranges human combinations by putting in them the maximum of bitterness. This game amuses him. It doesn't matter, my friend, we'll talk, we'll dream, we'll tell each other things… Oh! no memories! no, for God's sake, no memories! other things, preferably things that are calm, immobile, things that are completely restful! Memories, you see, it upsets you too much, with that sacred mania that possesses them of changing shape at every moment, of color and expression, depending on whether you look at them from the left or from the right, from the front or from behind. You take one out of the shady corner where it was sleeping, you shake it, you plant it in front of you, you smile at it, in the hope that it will charm you, and then you realize that it has changed its face , that it's not that at all anymore… And the memory makes you sad!

" I say ! shut up, Serval! you're going to tell me that I tell stories… I admit it, I don't argue, but they are true, my stories, and that doesn't make them any more pleasant, especially when they have to be lived.

“Serval, my comrade, what a cut! We lived together; we used to meet every day, and suddenly there were those ellipsis… Now we're going to get back in touch, but, Serval, it's terrible to meet someone you love in a new setting! You're a painter… (you're still a painter, aren't you?) Can a painter not know that paintings change appearance when they change frame? Mistresses, friends, comrades are subject to this law. A former servant to whom one was attached becomes intolerable because one no longer lives in the same street or because, in the same house, one has moved down to the floor below. The apartment is more comfortable, but Martin, that old friend who served your parents, how can you put up with him for a week!

“So I shall see you again before long, no longer in the hospital, no longer in the depot, nor in Alsace, but in this countryside full of rays and perfumes, where, from time to time, Mahoudiaux goes to meditate. You don't know her, neither do I; it will delight us; of that, I am certain: “la Cassolette” is a marvelous place; Mahoudiaux has described it to me a hundred times. Chance of life meant that I never went there, nor Lucienne, but I have this landscape in my eyes. It is at "La Cassolette" that Mahoudiaux has seen the most beautiful sunsets, the most beautiful shimmerings on the sea, the most beautiful reflections; it was in the surrounding pine wood that, on certain summer evenings, he breathed truly unforgettable perfumes, in this wood, where a few nightingales never ceased to sing, finally "la Cassolette" is full of small flowers whose we do not know the name, first, tiny, simple, delicious flowers that we quickly learn to know, to cherish, that we will soon cherish… That's perfect. But we're going to spend a few weeks at “La Cassolette”, my wife, you, Mahoudiaux and me… That's something new, that's something unknown!

“I'm afraid, Serval, I'm afraid that you lack charity towards me! Very often, I confided in you, I told you everything I felt: my anguish, my pleasures... The pain I was suffering, I told you clumsily, no doubt, perhaps all of a sudden. through, but I told you. Keep me in mind. Remember our chats in the barn, the bat that hovered around us, the moonbeam that sometimes visited us. Try to understand me, even if I have changed, and above all, Serval, be charitable!“This last disgrace broke me, morally, physically, in the flesh and in the spirit! I'm just trash. All the same, it's not allowed to have such a bad luck, all to yourself! It looks like it was made in my size; it seems that we have taken the measures in advance, so that this flawless jinx does not make a crease. "Serval, I'm well dressed!"

“In short, I don't have much more to tell you, but I repeat this: don't be too hard, or too severe, or too logical; yes, don't be too logical… well… manage yourself.

“I shake your hands. Devoted tone:

“  Stork.  »

There were a few more lines written across his letter and in a more nervous, more unstable handwriting:

“I signed: Stork! Nicknames stick! I had to make myself a signature because you imposed a nickname on me! I had to change my skin because you saw me other than I was! Now, I sign naturally, effortlessly. Thanks to my comrades, I became Stork, for a long time.

“About the comrades… this brave Merville was killed near Traubach. I found out about it through an agent on leave, through Lieutenant Bernaut's order. The lieutenant is well and thinks he is going to be sent to Salonika. Obviously, he will be killed there at less cost than in Alsace where, for some time now, there has been nothing but a little noise, and still not every day. Over there, in Salonica, he will find good fevers in addition to shells. He's lucky, him! But, before leaving you to your paintings, your drawings, tell me, old man, there, very frankly, tell me what you think of her. You saw her, you talked together; what do you think of Lucienne? It's her, isn't it? Did you recognize her? Her image haunted our chats where I wanted to show her to you as she is, as I love her. Did I succeed?

“To you of heart:

“  Stork.  »

I answered him immediately. I tried to console him a little; I assured him of my affection; I announced to him a peaceful and charming stay at "La Cassolette" where he, Mahoudiaux and I, these three old wrecks would console each other, where his wife would bring all her goodness, all her charm and all her common sense. I tried to write to him kindly, affectionately. The slightest sentence that falls out of line or is misunderstood would lose him in a new labyrinth, but he doesn't need it: he already suffers too much; I feel that he suffers too much!… Charitable? he asks me to be charitable? but that goes without saying! Charitable? I'll do my best.

CHAPTER XLII
There is always, in novels, a certain setting, chosen by the author, in front of which his characters will express themselves more clearly, more frankly, will throw themselves against each other, hurt each other and cry. It is the setting of their battlefield: a bed, a lake, a beautiful setting sun; it suits their anxieties. — If I were a novelist, I would certainly have chosen La Cassolette to intoxicate, to panic my couple in love, to unite them, one evening, with cries, tears, sighs, and then torment them, like it befits.

The question arises in another way and I see, in this retreat, only three poor cripples whom a young woman surrounds with vigilant care. We meet on a terrace overlooking rolling pine woods, dotted with white rocks; other pine woods overhang it. In this greenery, the house of Mahoudiaux is buried, but, from the windows, the view is free, the horizon high. The shaded terrace is more intimate. Go, now, to this balustrade, bend over and you will again see the sparkling sea, cut by a peninsula, two deep blue gulfs, a few villas, alas! monumental and pretentious, but distant, finally a lot of luminous air. — I like the landscape that I discover from my window, it exalts me, it makes me breathe deeply, it intoxicates me a little; the one I enjoy, lying on my chaise-longue, near Mahoudiaux and Cigogne, brings me a very sweet happiness. The sky full of rays, the blue shield of the waters, can be guessed between the black and red trunks of the pines; nearby, a few steps away, the fragrant brushwood is dotted with small mauve and white flowers that should not be picked because they fade too quickly. We slowly raise our eyes and, in the maze of branches where an infinite ivy clings and winds, our gaze is lost.

I put my book on my knees: Dominique's misfortunes no longer interest me; I let myself go to my calm pleasure, I dream… Stork, his big right foot leaning on a chair, smokes cigarettes and, looking absorbed, seriously folds and folds a sheet of paper from which, later, will be born a cocotte, a boat or a policeman's hat; Mahoudiaux smokes his pipe, grunts, gets up abruptly, goes to give a few orders (this installation, understood in this way, isn't it perfect?), comes back, sits down again and smokes like an Olympian, while MadameMaxence prowls around, passes, passes noiselessly, gives Cigogne his "drops", goes to lean against the balustrade, smiles while looking at the sea, reminds me of the time when I have to drink two spoonfuls of a smelly mixture, recommends us , putting an ashtray close at hand, not to set fire to the brushwood, then also lies down, tired, for a moment.

“Luciana! »

I've been calling her Lucienne since yesterday: Cigogne asked me to.

“Luciana! I don't want to take my drug: it smells too bad!

- Will you swallow that right now!

“Then pinch my nose, Lucienne…- Here, my friend, and you will have a candy to remove the taste!

"One would not be ill, Lucienne, one would become so, to be treated by you." »

She laughs, she is lying down, fanning herself with a large paper fan, bought the day before at the town bazaar, and which claims to come from Japan. Terrible, this fan! at the first opportunity, I will offer one of my brush to Lucienne, if indeed I still know how to paint! Today, the colors bother me, I only like to smell the perfumes of the Cassolette, so aptly named.

Mahoudiaux gets up, once more, empties his pipe, scrubs it, growls again, complains about the quality of the tobacco, then:

'My old Serval,' he said, 'I have transformed the large bedroom on the second floor into a workshop for you. It will be hot there, I believe, but the day seems to me excellent. You can work there on your studies taken outdoors. Its good ! It's good ! no sentences! (He always says thank you, the animal!) You will come to see that, after lunch. - Lucienne! Emilie will have to be asked to carry the two chairs from the antechamber to M. Delacroix's new studio! the poor guy wouldn't have anything to sit on...

'I'm going right away, Maurice. No, no, don't move! I announce to you that we will have red mullet this morning. I've just admired them in the kitchen: they're magnificent… And then stuffed tomatoes, chops… The cheese hasn't arrived yet, but Emilie assures me that it won't be long. »

Mahoudiaux laughs and asks if this cheese will come by itself, by the rocky slope or by the road… Mahoudiaux has exquisite jokes.

I stay with my nose in the air looking at the branches. Domino, the little black and white cat, circles around my lounge chair, claws at my pants, decides to pounce on me, stretches while I scratch him carefully under the chin, finally climbs up to my face and gives me a grateful, polite flick of his raspy tongue.

Life thus understood… ah! I want to live it!CHAPTER XLIII
Mahoudiaux, a cloth folded over his right arm (the only good one), a red feather duster in his hand, looks quite dignified.

“There you go…” he said to me; now you will know how to find your way around, I think. If, by any chance, you wish to study geography or history, which seems unlikely to me, you will find all that on the shelves at the top, but you have to use the scale. In this case you would call Emilie who does not blush to show her calves. The ladder is unsafe, your leg even less so: don't risk climbing. And besides, I only grant you, as reading, the novels of these lower shelves. You are here to paint, have fun and relax, not to educate yourself. - Take ! Hello, Roger! »

The Cassolette library is quite remarkable. For an hour, Mahoudiaux has been revealing its riches to me. He knows it thoroughly, he walks there as in a familiar garden. He picks up a book, dusts it, wipes its binding, shows it to me lovingly, talks about it eloquently. This collection is old, but he himself greatly increased it and finally brought it together, two years before the war, in this room, built expressly as an annex to the house. Mahoudiaux adores his books, they move him, nevertheless, I do not discover in him the somewhat ridiculous quirks of the true bibliophile, of the typical bibliophile. His books are alive, he reads them; it is by reading them, he says, that one prevents them from dying.

“Those who bore me and who will never interest me, I get rid of them. »

Stork has just entered, leaning heavily on his rubber-tipped cane. He looks at this numerous people dressed in canvas or leather, tidy.

“You will find, adds Mahoudiaux, quite good prints in the compartment on the left. I recommend the Méryons… Are you looking for a book, Roger?
