   Left with their native strength and human intelligence alone, many a brave hunter would easily become a meal for the "game" he desired to kill.

Beauty Of The Battle: Have you ever been a hunter? If not has anyone told you tales of some brave hunters? Imagine you are a hunter, ready to go for a game. Imagine you plan to go out hunting such a brave beast as a lion, or a mean and man-eating tiger. You would not just go out there with a lone bow and arrow. You would not be in the thick jungle with an inexperienced puppy as your only companion.

Reason will tell you to be prepared. You will surely spend some time learning how a tiger reacts to a threat. You will like to know the best way to surprise the "dangerous" beast with tact and overwhelming surprise. Of course you may even think of trapping on its trails. Thereby saving yourself a heck of convenience.

If you are a rich hunter you would consider to mount a theodolite. Just to survey the deadly beast at a distance. But, should you desire to fight the beast with a gun, you will likely climb a nearby tree to its residence. when the beast is not home. You will surely stay motionless until the animal returns. Then, you will aim either at its head, chest, or abdomen. You will like to shoot to do the beast an irreparable damage. You will do it in such a way that your first shot would either kill it, or knock it so much unconscious that you would easily master its resistance.

Try to imagine becoming a hunter. Push your sense of imagination a little further. Try, you must. Win, you must too. Such are the ways every hunter sees his own world. It is a jungle out there. A hunter who wants to have a mouthful of prize meat must be ready to shoot to kill.

Succeed At All Costs: Of course, being a good hunter, you must never forget that your commitment is a pact between victory and danger. As you think what you will do to the dangerous animal, you will also anticipate what the "dangerous" animal can do you, the intrusive assailant. Therefore, you would resolve, not only to take extra precaution, but also extra defensive mechanism, cunning and extra arms.

You, the good hunter must agree with the hunter in you that you have chosen your weapons carefully. You must choose to succeed.

And when successful, you must handle your success.

Nothing will hold you back from shooting when your target is on target-except you the hunter.

Test Of The Fight: When things get rough, the easiest way to get going is only to turn back and leave the scene. But, does that solve the problem? By all means, no.

'Me cost of such a retreat, as someone will eventually note, is much greater than the move to move the obstacle. No one will go into a battle with intent to be beaten. If he knew he would not win, he would be better off not even waging a war destined to his ultimate defeat.

From some of our "African jungles" or "Canadian jungles" or "Soviet jungles" or "Amazon jungles" or "United States jungles"

Are intense practical lessons those who live near those "jungles"

Must learn.

First, grant me your indulgence, if you will, to begin with lessons obtainable from, and derivable by those who live near "African jungles."

There are people we call "tree cutters" in Africa. These people, their occupation is not only to fell a big tree but also to saw its timbers into planks. A European, or someone from a Western country would call them "lumberjacks" or "lumbermen." Nonetheless, I shall abide with the name I grew up with; which you do now know, and henceforth is advised to know as "tree-cutters."

Now, when a tree cutter goes to a jungle to fell a big tree for economic returns; he will go to the "jungle" tree with his axe, knife, whetting stone, some food and water. If he is the type of person who respects the spirits of our forefathers; he will not fail to sacrifice a newly laid hen's egg at the foot of the tree before he allows the first blow of his axe to rest on the base of the big tree.

He will plead his innocence as he propitiates his intention to devastate the dwelling place of the departed souls. Then he will raise his axe and start to rest it's sharp edge on the base of the tree. He will cut the tree in such a way that it would fall in an opposite direction from him.

Often times a tree cutter would climb a tree he is about to fell; tie a long rope at one of its branches, and extend the cord of the rope away in the opposite direction from the point of cut.

Specialists in tree cutting know that the best way to avoid accident while felling a tree is: To make a deep right-angled cut in the direction the tree cutter would like his tree to fall. Then start cutting in the opposite end of the tree's base. And to have the cutter's companion pull the tree down with the rope, from a distance, in the direction desirable for the tree to fall.

Before the white man brought in his chain saw and motorized tree-cutting machines, some trees could last for two or three days prior to their being felled. And before a tree cutter and his companion would go home in the evening, they would use some rudiments of palm fronds as warning signals to the public that a major danger is loomed ahead. These rudiments would be tied to some nearby tress-as our African custom does stipulate. The Lessons: It is not the first blow of the axe on the tree that fells the tree Neither is it the last strike of the axe that fells the tree. But it is the aggregate of blows of the axe on the tree that does the job. Do you doubt it? Think twice, you will understand.

The tree cutter will be hugely blessed when his expected Financial returns rest in his hands, and in his pockets after he has done his job in a desirable way. This is success. This is the activation of inner feeling of feeling good by a desirable objective so ably accomplished.

There is nothing that gives a person a more sense of happiness than sense of winning in any life's challenge. Success is a challenge. When you win, you are really a success.

One can go on to point out on count to count basis his failures. Or, he may go ahead to enumerate some of his amazing successes. Be it failure or success, often, it takes guts to become a success. Moreover, it is not everyone who will be able to make it.

Naturally, the excuses for failures cannot be numbered. Conversely, though, "a man of action" is that very fellow who tried and failed, but never failed to try again. Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe is a member of this group.

Winston Churchill had this quality, Abraham Lincoln was not an exception.

These have made history.

At one point or the other, they received knocks of temporary defeats. Yet, quit? Never. Zik, I believe has no room for quit-ability in his mind. Neither did Churchill, nor Abraham Lincoln, Political stimulants indelibly chronicled in history; each of these personage, whether alive or gone, is a monumental figure of political success.

A dreamer of success is not a friend of those who are only out to frustrate.

Every person has a winner-like ego which desires to be pampered like something very special. A successful person is the heartthrob in his environment.

He rolls out the punches, and they are accepted with grace.

Hardly can one get control in the midst of frustrating influences. Prudence, and rightfulness of character alone cannot deter retrogressive punches of ugly characters. Many an ugly character would be perpetrating abhorable crimes without the slightest of intentions.

The gap a success-seeker is ready to hold between him and those who have no intent to succeed will go a long way to determine his degree of success.

Success-makers often admonish their emulators "don't go with the crowd" without remembering that their own niche is also a "crowd"

I believe the right counsel to that effect must be "don't go with the wrong crowd." There is nothing wrong with going with the crowd of winners.

Right? Yes, it does not take much horse sense to understand, to outwit impact of failure-minded crowd one must join the band of success.

You can make your life count whether others see it that way or not. Charge your subconscious being with positives necessary to repel evil darts hauled in by those who think negatively about success. Share this pre-eminent idea with those you love.

It is a small price to pay to be an eternal winner. This price transcends every dogma, tenet, or belief system. It does not matter how failures feel about your success. The fact that failures ardently demand companions is a warning signal to avoid their crowd. They know that their station hurts.

And they want to share their hurts.

In view of this call to succeed, there exist some elements of consideration.

When you have come to this groove essential-10 success, it is essential you acquire a thorough seeking mind. Note, and never forget: 1. That you are on this planet, earth to succeed.

2. That your success rests primarily on you, secondarily on your inclinations, and tertiarily on the powers of your association.

3. That you have the power to pay the price of your amazing success.

4. That you will use part of your success to create chains of success.

5. That you will use your success not to human detriment, but for greater human enlightenment.

6. That you will not use your success to deter the success growth of others.

7. That you will constantly gird up your loins in an everlasting alertness in protecting, and in defense of your success.

8. That you will not stop creating more success when the growth of your success has reached it's maximum height.

9. That you will not fail to support those who would come to you.

10.That you will be more of a success maker, and nil of its opposite.

11.That you will do your goal-oriented desires in strideful zeal and with amazing determination.

12.That you will set a specific time for your goal attainment.

13.That you will constantly reflect on your definite tasks, and task yourself till it is accomplished prior to or on the set time.

14.That even now, that you have given the above points both an emotional and enthusiastic approval.

Friend, if your purpose of reading this book is not to be a success; then, this book is not written for you. However, it is not my desire that you drop off right now. Because your conscience may prick you for not accepting life as an opportune challenge.

Friend, how do you view the fourteen points of dynamism? Are you disenchanted?

Disinclined? Or, worst, not interested?

No matter how an individual might see it, things are bound to happen once they are in use. It is these delightful dynamics that would initiate and forward your progress. It is therefore, up to you to use them and succeed.

Hello, you are equally free to disagree with the ideas. But, the fact that they can work for you when you apply them are the thing that make the point.

The burden of this endeavor rests not that one disputes them, but that you apply them to your maximum advantage.

Forget the pessimist's counsel that every endeavor "is a potential danger."

Because he hardly "risks" as such he hardly succeeds.

Cast to a distant memory "the rich and poor shall die" form of philosophy.

For that is the mind-frame of that very individual who has no hope for the Future.

Set your ambition high enough that its fervor will catch fire with the consuming power of your imagination. It is through this degree of imaginative excitement that you win in almost every aspect of your set goal. Keep it in practice, you who want to win in life.

The non-go-getter, this road, to him is inhospitable at best. And a place it is best, no need to try-And when this is untried, his fight against success will be as good as over.

The Van Of Success: A cornucopia of abundance is just about to be delivered to your doorway.

How you will handle such a generous offer will determine your success rates among your equals.

You have the right to doubt it. You also have the right to see the truth as it is. It is the truth that draws a line between the rich and the poor.

Truth does not need an opposition. It is a class by itself. For example, if you want to lead a strong race-horse; you cannot do so by standing fact to face to it, pulling it. And, at the same time expecting it to follow you. Rather, you must turn your back to it, hold its strap as you do, and walk before it.

If indeed you are success-motivated; there is, doubtless, a twofold catch just for you: Creative thought and active involvement. The lower organisms, for example, the aquatic symbionts know the mutual benefits obtainable through this. They work like a couple of riders on a tandem bicycle. Their action or duty and mutual involvement in it is mutually satisfying.

Success is a game of chance. When you play and lose, you learn from it. No one has ever won it all. No one will. However, you've got to roll on with the wind.

In your mind will be incorporated more success-making desires commensurate with your aspirations. And it will be up to your mind to adopt the step by step strategies with aim to addressing your needs.

The Door Of Success: The way to amazing success; for some people, is just to lay obstructions on the ways of those who would dare to succeed. There are however, some people who see it in a different light: They contend that a lasting success is one grounded in mutual assistance to those who would otherwise not make it without some helping hand. Sure as a tide, the latter view is in harmony with the laws of success.

Believe it or not, anyone who dwells in constant jeopardization of others' interests just to boost his own interest-Will sooner or later, be a victim in the gallows which he himself fixed against others. And his agony will be a prolonged jeremiad.

This is a world where many people want to make their lives count. A person who wants to alter his destiny must commence with a change of heart.

"Artists" said Reverend T.R. McKibbens, "are often prophets." It is high time all and sundry did revamp thought-patterns of global future. It is high-time we did appreciate the present, learn from the Past, and welcome the future with intense anticipation.

We long for a new era. It is a new hope which will open up an Amazing vista of what new life should and ought to be. It is the hope which will capture your powers of imageries with a new vision for an amazing future.

Take a look at the suffering humanity. Is suffering alone not a clarion call for an amazing change? In an ideal society; yes, even in a good world, things would not be so.

There is an amazing gulf between those who have got it made, and those who are at the lowest rungs of success quagmire.

The rich are; with no doubt, the fiduciary hope with long gain status. Their viable economic lease of action is a banner that conveys a mark of approval.

Obviously the essence of this treatise is to arouse you the reader with a strong urge: To assimilate in you an indomitable drive that will never ever shy away from every life's tough blow-Which indeed is an amazing success in disguise.

Come, let us have a new vision for the future. Our world needs some repair.

You and I can do it. Let us do it with neither fear nor favor.

Failure Is Not Final: No condition is complete. And there is no success opposite that is total. You can turn your victimization into glorification. You can change your defeats into victories.

You can put your pitfalls as uplift conversions to your higher heights in glory.

There is no misfortune, no reverse of growth no economic tragedy that cannot, be changed for human progressive needs. Excellence of purpose and dream fulfilled are outgrowths of so much frustrations as tests prior to the triumphs.

People who have been through them are evident testimonies to the need to be steadfast even in the midst of rising tides of life's reversals. Sounds incredible? Job of the Scriptures had an amazing crunch of frustration.

Leaders of other worthy causes are no exceptions. Nelson Mandela is an amazing example in our modern time. It is that very type of persevering determination, the dream to endure at a point of perpetual imprisonment, the quest to change things humanly perceived unchangeable, that give laurels at short or long term, to the object of victimization.

People need be reminded over and over again that success does not always mean being born into the house of abundance. The easiest way to succeed is to see a need and fill it. Americans call such a need "an opportunity."

Look Up, Victory Ahead: Are you ready to handle success? Do you really know that success has multiple bombshells? Have you ever seen a bomb explode? Success is that way.

A footstep in the way of success is a small meal that makes a mighty food.

It is the initial answer to one's need .

You will discover, sooner or later, that the greatest success making secret" is just a common-sense idea. It is the "secret" which many people refuse to use due to its simplicity. Many people are looking for complex solutions to a simple problem-Only to have themselves fail all the success-making tests.

The so called "sophisticated" solutions to success-reversals can easily enough be overlooked. They cannot stand the test of time because their "sophistications"

Make simplistic solution something far from their rectification.

But, the common-sense idea had what takes to succeed . It knows how to use it. It can make it. You can call the way of success, if you will. Sounds Simple? Yes because it is the answer. It is the success made easy. The secret gives one the strength to succeed. And an amazing prescience in psychoautonomic.

Appeal. Is that not wonderfully fantasy?

When your success explodes, there will be no telling that people who are nearby will notice.

We are still talking about that "secret" idea that creates success. There are many success-stories; as you would note, world over. It is the same success making secret, or a group of secrets that brought billions of naira annually to Arthur Nzeribe, Chief Abiola, and Alhaji Dantata.

Somewhere within this chain of secrets, one will see the very thing which turned our former Head of State, General Obasanjo from a Statesman to a civilian, from civilian to literary legend, and from literary personage to a successful farmer.

I do recall the first time I shook hands with him in Boston, Massachusetts. I found that great leader a very humble man. I was really amazed.

"Africa has been marginalized" he remarked during a reception party we held in his honor. As I thought about this great man, I found a great reason to be proud of my nationality.

It was not an over-statement when my good friend, Dr. Philip Aquan who; while introducing General Obasanjo, simply stated that the great General's historic contributions are greater than that made by Julius Caesar or, Chaka the King of Zulu.

I recalled the events that made the legend-His military records, statesmanship, literary contribution, plus many others which cannot be numbered.

His contributions alone are amazing chain of success. He made every stride, as he still does, in an amazing way-Thereby turning every station he stepped in to an amazing chain of success. Despite a point of negative publicity when he was the Head of State, the man has shown that a man can succeed in whatever he wants to do. "My Command"

"Not My Will", "Nzeogwu" plus a host of others are clear cases of chains of literary success.

Success is an on-going process. You have to shine brighter before you can be noticed in a galaxy of stars.

The only impediment to human ingenuity is solely attributable to sources of-, within reason, discouragement. Outside that, the sky is the only limit to what a person can achieve.

A Case History During the Civil War in Nigeria, a lone Biafran soldier, Corporal Nwafor saw the need to apply this secret. He did it when the "enemy" had routed his Biafran comrades to a hasty retreating point. Without display of military toughness he ably subdued and captured the very "ferret" armored vehicle that was shooting, shelling and killing his comrades with reckless regard.

Life is that way. People often accomplish the unexpected when confronted with a life-threatening event. It was his prompt response to the demand that made the history. And, it is easy to make it when one knows how.
