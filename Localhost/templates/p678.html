I must also not forget to mention the name of my old friend and fellow forty-niner of California, James Phelan, Esq.,[Pg 39] of San Francisco to whose generosity we are mainly indebted for this splendid entertainment to-night, whose patriotic spirit and warm-hearted nature always come to the front on such occasions. May his shadow never grow less, and that he may never die till I kill him.

As allusion has been made to the war of the rebellion, in which comrade McKay took a most prominent part on the side of the South, and Colonel Hungerford and myself serving in the Union Army. Although South Carolina and New York troops fought side by side in the same brigade under the gallant General Shields in Mexico, we found ourselves, unfortunately, arrayed against each other in later years in our own country, and no man who is a man will from political or personal motives keep alive the passions of the war, or by fanning the embers of sectional hatred for political or partisan effect, subject our people to the charge of vindictive malignity. I trust we have long since forgotten the bitter memories of our Civil War, and that we only remember the gallant acts and deeds of both armies.

I have hoped for years back that the time would come, and it is happily now at hand, when the brave soldiers of the society of the army of Northern Virginia, who fought under the gallant Lee, will meet side by side at the annual reunions with the soldiers of our society of the army of the Potomac, who fought under McClellan, Grant, Meade, and Sheridan, and at other festive meetings of our various army gatherings and organizations of old soldiers, where I have never heard a word said against, but the highest praise accorded to our gallant but misguided southern brothers for their bravery and daring on the battlefield.

Colonel Murphy was called upon to respond to the last sentiment,—in memory of our dead comrades,—which he did, as follows:

I am called on to say a word to the memory of our dear departed comrades. Would that I had command of language to do justice to our dead heroes. Father Time has fearfully thinned our ranks, and few of us can point to the comrade who was his file leader and marched shoulder to shoulder[Pg 40] with us nearly 50 years ago, and the death roll since the Mexican War has been frightful among the distinguished men of that army who have been called to their final account. I mention a few, Scott, Taylor, Pillow, Quitman, Twiggs, Duncan, Pierce, Kearney, Hancock, Shields. The last named general, and the last surviving general of that war, was a welcome guest at my house a few years ago when stricken with a fatal sickness when far away from his Western home and kindred. I well remember the gallant Lieutenant Ralph Bell of the South Carolina Regiment, mentioned by comrade McKay, and who, while wounded, led the forlorn hope at Chapultepec. He accompanied me to California in 1849, and his eyes I closed in death at Sacramento City the following year, and whose placid countenance looks down upon me here to-night. These are sad memories, and the tongue can but feebly express the feelings of the heart at this time; our own bent forms and fast becoming hoary locks admonish us that it will not be long before we too are called to tread the same path, and no matter what our former condition in life, there is no distinction then. The dead, how beautiful is the memory of the dead, what a holy thing it is in the human heart, what a chastening influence it has upon human life, how it subdues all the harshness that grows up within us in the daily intercourse with the world, how it melts our hardness and softens our pride, kindles our deepest love, and waking our brightest aspirations in the camp and by the wayside, in solitude or among our comrades, think sadly and speak lovingly of the dead.

It occurred to the compiler of this pamphlet that it would not be out of place to mention the name of Colonel Murphy’s son, Ignatius, a well-known journalist and editorial writer, who wrote the life of Colonel Hungerford (a book of nearly 400 pages). This gallant soldier recently died in Rome, Italy, at the home of his daughter, the Countess Telfener, at the Villa Ada, attaining the ripe age of seventy-five years. He passed peacefully away, surrounded by his affectionate wife, his daughter, the Countess, and his numerous grandchildren.

Ignatius Ingoldsby Murphy deserves more than a mere honourable mention in connection with the corn propaganda.[Pg 41] When his father commenced his missionary labors, in 1887, he was flooded with correspondence from all parts of Europe. This son, who was a third year naval cadet at Annapolis, resigned, and came over to Europe to assist his father, for which his knowledge of European languages eminently qualified him.

IGNATIUS INGOLDSBY MURPHY

CADET 1st CLASS, UNITED STATES

NAVAL ACADEMY, ANNAPOLIS, MD., U.S.A.

When his father was ordered from Berlin to Russia, by General Rusk, at the request of the Grand Duke Sergius, the uncle of the present Emperor, the Secretary of Agriculture appointed him as special agent and secretary to take his father’s place in Germany, and much of the success of this propaganda is fairly attributable to his valuable assistance, together with that of Colonel Murphy’s wife, who recently died in Brussels. This extraordinary and gifted woman gave the last fifteen of the best years of her life to this work; in fact her whole life, no less than her pen has been devoted to the welfare of others. The two daughters also worked together with the same energy and enthusiasm as their father, for no one man could have accomplished such phenomenal work in so short a time.

The exports of our American corn (maize) was only 24,000,000 bushels of 56 lbs. each in 1888, less than four per cent. of our production. The year after the commencement of this propaganda, which Colonel Murphy undertook on his own initiative and sole expense, unaided by anyone, the exports went up rapidly, and in 1901 were over 213 million bushels, and every acre of land on the corn belt has doubled in value in the last fifteen years. This result proves the value of the work done by this propaganda in showing the people of Europe the value of maize as human food, which was formerly only considered as fit food for animals. This family deserves a place on the roll of grateful remembrance.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
