me Maxence. I do not see her. How to speak to a shadow, to a faceless ghost? how to talk to someone who for me is only a name and a first name (two, with Florimonde!)? Cigogne, who knows his wife, could... By the way, does he know her?... And if I had nothing to say to Lucienne Maxence, isn't it also, isn't it above all, that I don't know Cigogne? Is he a vaudeville, drama or masked entertainment character? What do I know of him? Nothing but small pleasant or sad details that don't recompose the character for me. Is it a man who suffers? who enjoys suffering? a mad person ? a poor devil?

If I didn't know how to write to Mme Maxence, it may be that I don't know her husband. If I tried to paint Stork's portrait, it would indeed be a banality or a caricature, the image of anyone, or of a grotesque bird; I've tried it many times before. "His portrait?... a changing reflection!" - How to paint this?

CHAPTER XXXII
From the lavender notebook.

The milkmaid who has been serving us since we have been here and whose shop is at the corner of the Cours and the rue des Clarisses, is a good woman, very deserving. I often stop, when I get home from the hospital, to chat with her for a while, sometimes I even go to see her on purpose, because she knows the whole neighborhood (I should say the whole city) and gives me valuable information. on so many poor people whom no one takes care of, whose misery remains hidden and whom one can help in a very simple way, with a little discretion. "Why didn't I limit myself to listening to her alone!" But no…

Beside their mother, whose head was covered with an old ragged shawl, these two thin children pained me. I met them, almost every day, in front of the hospital or in one of the neighboring streets. They didn't reach out, they were cold, maybe they were hungry. I spoke to them. The mother told me her sad story: she was ill; her husband, at the front, gave no news… a pitiful story, the one we hear constantly. She received my little offering with such an embarrassed air that I thought: the poor woman isn't used to it yet.

So bent over, so tired, between the two brats she held by the hand, very close, as if she were afraid of losing them, this unfortunate girl represented all misery to me. I had embroidered a little novel about her, I had even softened Maurice (who, however!…), I promised myself to come to her aid in a more lasting and more effective way, when she suddenly disappeared. .

This morning, the milkmaid whom I asked to inquire, exclaimed:

“Oh! my good lady! for sure I will tell you what has become of the daughter Angèle! You should have asked me before! A peasant can put you in his pocket pretending to have a cold. You run right away to get him a handkerchief! Your poor wife, well, she is, with all due respect, Madame, a tramp who, before the war, stopped sailors in the port. For nearly a year, she has rented these two toddlers to a chair re-seater to soften good people like you, Madame. It paid more than his first job. And she speaks well! “My lost husband, my poor little ones who are starving, and I'm not used to begging, and I'm sick! finally all that she has certainly debited to you. But it did not pass in front of my dairy!

My milkmaid had too much to tell. I left. What a horrible adventure!

So, for everyone, it's the same thing! You can't get an idea of ​​someone without being grossly mistaken, or is it me who's always wrong? 'I confessed my blunder to Mahoudiaux, but this time he didn't laugh. He answered me quite friendly:

“My dear Lucienne, one has just the right to say of a donkey that one guesses by the tip of the ear: that could very well be a donkey. — From that to saying: it was the donkey which carried Our Lord on Palm Sunday, a long time ago, had one seen its two ears, its four hooves and its tail. »

And it was me who laughed.

I will remember this first lesson (when I was little, I was warned enough against premature judgments!) but it seems that it was not enough: I needed a second. I received it in the mail this morning.

Mr. Serval answered me… This man, I thought he was intelligent, understanding; I counted on him, since Roger loves him so much; I made an image of him (as for the poor woman with the two brats), and his letter disconcerted me more (ah! certainly yes!) than the milkmaid's little speech.

I wouldn't want to be harsh, but we're not dumber! He didn't understand anything, he appeared blind and deaf, he doesn't know Roger, he didn't guess my pain (I didn't hide it from him, though!), and his smearing of ink is a pie of nonsense. In fact, I don't know where it comes from: from some novelty store, no doubt, or from a village notary's office. He must paint (since he is a painter!) in his spare time. His letter is polite, on the whole, but how we feel that he has no use, that it bothers him to write to a woman! The fool! and, for me, what a lesson! No ! we're not that stupid! (I'm talking about myself, for once). But I will be able to laugh when Roger again praises the taste and sensitivity of his dear Serval… Sensitivity! Ah!

Of course, I won't say anything to Maurice about all this: he really would have the right to laugh.

I am going to burn M. Serval's letter.

CHAPTER XXXIIIIt is dark in the barn, dark night this time. You feel like a child, all alone in your room; we would gladly be afraid. I rediscover impressions of yesteryear, of the time when I was a kid, of lost terrors, finally this pane (you know well: the one through which the moon enters), it now looks like a dark and dirty face . Tomorrow, without fail, I'll give it a wet rag.

I do not want to sleep. I think of the letter that Cigogne's wife wrote me; not to my reply: to her letter to her; my answer was too stupid… Cigogne… Lucienne… I'm thinking of the corner of the harbor that you can see from the windows of their living room, with the sails and the masts; I think of the dream that can be born at this sight; I imagine Stork, sitting in an armchair, smoking cigarettes and looking at this square of landscape bathed in the mauve light of a beautiful twilight; I think of the evocative influence of the slightest glimpse of the sea, I think of the dreams I would have if I were there, in that place, sunk into that armchair, my legs stretched out, my feet crossed on the carpet, while Maurice Mahoudiaux and Lucienne Maxence peacefully discuss the news of the day... But why dream instead of Cigogne? let him dream for himself.

“You who love landscapes, Stork, what landscape do you see from your windows, at home? »

A voice comes out of the night:

" Funny question !

— I thought that this landscape, if it's beautiful, if it's very ugly, if it's sad or if it's smiling, you have to see it again sometimes. The square of nature that we admire from our window accompanies us to the end of the earth.

"How right you are, Serval!" From my bedroom, I can only see the house opposite, gray and dirty, the wall of which is broken by a long oblique crack, but from the living room, which is cut away, I can see a corner of the port, with sails and masts, a corner of the quay, with people passing by, piles of ropes, bags and baskets, a dark corner of the ocean, far away, a corner of the sky, with birds and the wind that blows, because you see the wind when it blows hard, right?

'Yes,' I murmured, 'you can see the wind when it blows hard; it's true… But how beautiful are the boats at anchor! and how one dreams about them!

"And how good it is," said Cigogne, "to watch it without moving, without wanting to see more of it, because the whole world fits into this little frame." »

The night was getting thicker, it seemed. We no longer heard the familiar little noises, those of the straw being crumpled up; those mice who go about their business. We had forgotten them.

And I say again, in a low voice:

"We follow our whim, we go through the window, we escape, we walk along the quays, we get on a boat, then the boat sets sail, the boat leaves, we feel rocked by the first swells, we head out to sea, we're going, we're going all the way!

- You traveled, you! answered Stork; you know that ! but I, who have hardly ever left France except to go to Algiers, do nevertheless happen to dream of the same things. »

I wasn't listening to him. From time to time, but only from time to time, I have the right to let my imagination take me! of adventures that leaf through old memories:

"I approach Burma, Indo-China, China, I find countries that I adore, that I have known in the past for having spent a few hours, a few days, a few weeks there, and that I have never forgotten. I recognize beautiful temples, and this heavy river, and this strange speech... Then a stopover in Japan, when the cherry trees bloom, then, again, the sea and the beloved islands, the coast of Sumatra, solitary walks in a so nice garden ! the sea… Borneo which is quite a temptation! the sea, then the Indies and their delights, and their perfumes, and their colors, and their magnificent history, and the thick shadows of their forests. Then, a rest in France, then, the sea… and I return to the song of the waves, the song of the breezes, the birds, the complaints in the wind; I know the amber tones of a twilight in Shark's Bay,

- Oh ! Stork whispered softly like a distant echo.

I come back to myself: the present moment always ends up taking me back, reminding me, however far I may have gone. And I dismissed Cigogne.

" Good evening ! let me sleep ! »

I was afraid that he would want to answer me.

An hour passed, I think. I was almost asleep, I was completely asleep, perhaps, when a strange noise woke me. Stork stood up. A bit of moonlight let me see it. He was getting dressed; he was looking for something by the light of his flashlight; he put on his shoes with great care; he took his greatcoat although it was hot outside, his watch which he usually hangs on a nail, his revolver which he examined... why his revolver?... then, stealthily, he reached the corner of the barn where the ladder leading to the stable is located. He descended cautiously. I got up immediately and opened the little window that overlooks the courtyard.

Here it is ! He goes, he comes, he takes three steps to the right, three steps to the left. He stops, chin up. Looks like it's taking the wind. He approaches the well, he drinks a few mouthfuls, straight from the bucket. He lights a cigarette. He still walks here and there. Suddenly, he turns around towards the small wooden gate, next to the stable. He pushes her. You can join the road, across fields, passing by there.

So I lean out and shout:

“Stork! »

He turns around, all of a piece.

“Stork! What do you do ? »

First, he remains motionless, then he passes his hand over his eyes, then he comes back without haste, he enters the stable, I hear him going up slowly, slowly, with a little stop at each rung. Here he is in the barn.

“Stork! What do you do ? »

He is very calm.

"I went for a walk.

- At this hour !

- Yes.

- Where ?

- Any ... far!

"And the sentries?"

- Bah !

"What did you need, your revolver, your watch?"

- I was going ... you had said so many things! ... I was going to leave. »

His voice is still very calm.

" To leave ? But for where? For God Sake !

- Leave for anywhere, far, I've already told you. In any case, leave for good.

"Idiot!" you would have been brought back before dawn, and how!

- I wanted to leave, go there where there is what you said, where there are the beautiful things you said.

"You know, old man, in the times we live in, that's not leaving, that's deserting!" »

It took him a long moment of silent reflection before he understood. I wanted to see his face as he regained consciousness, but the moon wasn't bright enough.“Deserting…” he said, without betraying the slightest emotion. To desert… "

And there he is falling into the straw, in his usual place, fully shod, fully armed, without a word.

Now he sleeps.

Lets go ! it is advisable to watch his words when talking with Cigogne!

CHAPTER XXXIV
Cigogne was in a very jovial mood this evening. As far as he saw me, he raised his arms to heaven and exclaimed:

“She is very good, Serval! She is really nice ! »

I asked him the subject of his joy, but he was still laughing.

“She is very good, my old Serval! You will be laughing! »

Finally, I could find out.

“I got another letter from my wife! Imagine that Lucienne has taken it into her head to give me her opinion on all my comrades, according to what I tell her. I often talk about them, you know. And now it starts with you. Ah! it promises for others! — I skip the beginning which deals only with laundry, jams and my friend Mahoudiaux, but listen to the rest:

"Your comrade, the quartermaster André Serval...

" Take ! how does she know your name? I didn't think I knew it myself! I must have written it to him, then forgotten it.

“Your comrade, the quartermaster André Serval is certainly from the provinces, from the small provinces; it is not, moreover, a reproach that I make to him. I suppose he is a notary's clerk or employed in an administration. Well-bred, but a little... clumsy, as Mahoudiaux says, he must never have been in society, he doesn't know how to talk and yet he's not a peasant. You assured me that he paints. She must be ordinary! I see from here his watercolors that are too well washed. That is the idea I have of M. Serval. Am I very wrong? It would amuse me to know if my portrait is similar.

“Then she talks about something else. - You will admit, Serval, it's hilarious! Ah! She is really nice ! I'll laugh about it for eight days!

'If your wife,' I replied, 'draws this sketch from what you told her about me, I'm not flattered, my dear Stork, not by her appreciation, but by the information that motivates her.

- Do not talk nonsense ! How can you think!… No! women have such singular, bizarre imaginations! You would think they were crazy, sometimes… the most sensible! Lucienne wrote at random. By answering, I will tell her that she is a woodcock!

- Oh! no, for example!

"But you will admit, Serval, that it is very good!" »

Unfortunately, the excellence of a joke is judged from very different points of view. This convergence of our opinions on a subject often serves to give relief. - Oh! certainly, the joke, judged in an impartial way, is of a delicious taste!

CHAPTER XXXV
From the lavender notebook.

In the newspapers, no interesting news; the weather is grey, I am ill and they have put me in the hospital pharmacy, the ward department tiring me too much.

Roger's last letters are kind, affectionate… Oh! I sincerely forgive him for all the nasty things he wrote to me! Besides, he had no idea of ​​the pain he caused me. Why think about it myself? It is a beautiful and good nature, with small deviations due to his imagination and which I quickly forget.I receive regular visits from Mahoudiaux. He has an excellent influence on me: he prevents me from worrying. His arm might be a little better. Last night he had fun playing the piano with one hand and one finger. He hopes that in the long run...

Roger is wrong to defend his friend Serval, really indefensible! He persists in telling me that he is a man of excellent education and full of finesse. If he knew! As a joke, he threatened to read him the letter in which I gave my opinion of this gentleman (less harshly than in the pages of this notebook, but in a somewhat dry way). Roger won't dare.

We are bored ; I do little things in the evening, chatting with Maurice, but Maurice, too, despite his usual good humor, is a little melancholy. This gray weather, this constant humidity, this lack of news… We would be sad if not.

Unique ideas come to me. Did I make Roger happy? Have I done everything possible to give him the happiness to which he is entitled? I said above that his last letters were affectionate and kind… But doesn't he force himself to write them to me? It seems that he is worried about me and, however tender his words were, they had the effect on me of those said to a child to lull him to sleep, to a sick person to console him for his illness.

Here is more madness. I've been feeling so nervous for a few days! — Enough about my little person, so important: I hear Maurice hanging up his coat in the antechamber.

Maurice has just left. He interested me very much this evening when he talked to me about Roger. He has a very particular idea of ​​him, a little complicated.

"For ten years that I have known him, he has not changed a line," he said. He is a man who dreams too much of what he would like to do before doing it and who dreams about it until the moment when it is no longer time to do it, and who almost imagines having done it, because that he dreamed it. »

I believe that is the correct sentence.

“And who, he added, would suffer less from the failure of an action undertaken than from the failure of the overly ambitious dream that motivated it. »

He spoke thus for a very long time and ended by saying with a burst of laughter:

" It's frightening ! I become a philosopher! »

Strange judgment! There is something here that I don't understand. However, Maurice is fond of Roger; he followed him a lot in his life. I'll think about it tomorrow.

My God ! how tired I am! I'm going to bed !

CHAPTER XXXVI
I feel embarrassed. What I must relate is very simple, but nevertheless I dare not write it, when I think of the disappointment of my brave Cigogne, and, as I have the most sincere affection for him, to grieve him, even this indirectly and without having wanted to, or even to disappoint him, saddens me. "What will he say of my adventure?" what will he think of my luck?

So I was charged, yesterday, Monday, with a mission rather analogous to that which Cigogne had taken advantage of to dream a little warmly of a young girl whose steps he was directing. It was a matter of carrying a note across the fields, from the same trench to the same village where the colonel was still found, and following the same road.

I didn't meet a peasant woman, but the shells fell hard. I didn't have that quiet joy of which Cigogne spoke to me. It seemed to me that I swallowed my fear with great difficulty, and I could not at all distinguish the heroism of my action, nor the sprig of laurel that I would pick at the end of the race. No, I just had a worried stomach, if I may say so, and I suffered from a rather painful numbness in my calves.As I reached the first houses in the village, suddenly I go down on one knee (oh! without grace, without elegance!) and I realize that I have injured my leg.

By dragging my leg a little, I was able to get there anyway and deliver the envelope to the colonel who, precisely, was in conference with the medical officer, at the ambulance. I was therefore received both as a wounded man and as a liaison officer. While they were dressing me, the colonel congratulated me, spoke to me about the watering, shook my hand and, my faith, after a few moments, I understood that he was going to ask for the Croix de Guerre for me, which I was very satisfied.

As he was still chatting, I thought I could slip in a few tendentious words concerning Cigogne, or rather Roger Maxence; then a little lieutenant who happened to be there burst out laughing:

"Is this the one you all call Stork?" »

And he described it to the colonel in a somewhat inaccurate way, but very funny, I admit.

“It is moreover unbearable! he added.

Insupportable ! Why is that ? This lieutenant did not like Cigogne; he had no other reason to find him unbearable.

Stork's second quote was gone; it might have led to the awarding of the medal.

In conclusion, the colonel decreed:

“The way you accomplished your mission, Serval, puts you first and you can be proud of it. »

I really don't see why, other than that I had the clumsiness to get hurt.

I was about to explain to insist… The colonel smiled… and showed me the door of the ambulance: no doubt he had no time to lose.

So the jinx is attached to Cigogne?

CHAPTER XXXVII
And here is the end of our warlike life; sad, of course, this ending, as almost all endings are, because we hope for much more and better than we have and we regret what we have just lost. Thus man willingly forgets that he is happy, but he remembers having been. The moments we live seem incomplete, even when we enjoy living them, whereas, in memory, the moments lived take on a strange splendor, their boredom fades, their charm, their tragic beauty or picturesque increases, the daily pain, so heavy sometimes, becomes a beautiful past work, the dreadful lassitude of certain evenings turns into good fatigue, the cruel bite of the cold provokes a smile, when one thinks about it, and the overwhelming hours of sunshine when the helmet weighed on the head, when the linen stuck to the body, when one felt without strength and without going, these hours make one say: “Good God! were we warm enough! “One day, I will perhaps joke, seeing myself wading, once, in the mud! Joking about the mud… how impropriety!What do you want ! it's the past, it's quite simply the past, a country where you don't go back and which leaves you with its nostalgia, a country where pain loses something of its bitterness, where joy is haloed, because Yesterday's pleasure has a more radiant face than today's joy. "Wonderful, isn't it, that the herbarium of our memory preserves for us the freshest hues, the sweetest perfumes of flowers that we had neither seen nor smelled well, when these flowers were picked in the garden. ?

In times of peace, shall I think otherwise? what does it matter! On this subject, I believe that we all dream in a similar way: our memories of war will grow, the sonorous voice of the cannon will stifle the complaints, the glorious ensemble will no longer make it possible to distinguish the dismal detail. "Memories of war... they still have to be memories of war!" Ah! I would like my poor Stork, given what is happening to him, to forget a little the ugliness of the grief from which he suffers, from which he suffers, alas! without phrases and reasonably. — Moreover, this story once again gives me the certainty that only adventures happen to each being, however hard he tries; this one that I am going to tell you, seems imagined by Cigogne himself so that he suffers more. One would swear that this man does not know himself. Think again: he knows how to place his wound! Chance struck Cigogne. Chance? Stork couldn't have found better. I pity Cigogne with all my heart. - Listen.
