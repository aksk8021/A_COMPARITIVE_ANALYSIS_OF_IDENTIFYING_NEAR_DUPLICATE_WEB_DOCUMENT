Vivacity of youth, studious curiosity, desire to singularize himself, drew Mr. Unripe to the daring undertaking of traveling to the extreme northern tip of Europe. The North Cape was known for the geographical maps drawn by the Sailors, who had sailed the Ice Sea. Not knowing that others had gone to the ground, I, said Mr. Unripe , I will be the first to say with truth: I have seen the North Cape . The travels of Regnard , of Maupertuis , of Rudbech , of Linnaeus, concerned countries of those distant and cold regions; but they did not understand that famous and most distinct point of our continent. It is therefore no wonder that when Mr. Unripe [6]he published his Journey to the North-Cape in England , it came in a just reputation; and the encounter which his book had with the English, whose travels have so extended geographic science, natural history, and other very important branches of human knowledge, soon caused it to be reproduced in French. The acceptance that this book had afterwards in France was not for Mr. Unripe less honorable than he had had in England.

But who would believe it? In Italy, where every novelty of this kind has been traced for about forty years, no one thought of making this journey of Mr. Unripe , perhaps because he expected him to give an authentic edition himself in our language. Which if he did not do this, this must most probably be attributed to other occupations to which he returned to his homeland, and to that repugnance which the best minds often have at returning to their own [7]things already done, and the mutation that followed in his own circumstances, as well as public ones.

Meanwhile, it was not right that our literature should be cheated of this beautiful and interesting work. Therefore we adorn our Collection with them , confident that our diligence will be commended.

But in doing so, in agreement with the illustrious Author, we have given another form to the work. Many things written by him in his three volumes are no longer for our time, other events having taken place in the countries of which he spoke. Many men flourished then in the places he visited, which deserved particular mention, which are now confused in the mass of history. Travelers subsequent to him have talked copiously more than he does about what concerns various branches of natural history, so that it would be useless to repeat in these days what he had written at that time with all merit. We therefore, by consulting [8]the genius of most, we have removed all the superfluous; but we have religiously preserved all that makes his work truly precious, while remaining free to those who are more particularly interested in certain information concerning plants, birds, insects and such other things, to consult his work of three volumes; and the compendium, which we present in this volume alone, will not make you less grateful; especially that, having seen the various things written by others, contradicting each other around the character, habits and customs of the Laponi, with exact comparisons and with just criticism we were able to be convinced to have Mr. Unripe with full impartiality, with exact truth, and with singular diligence studied and expressed what was presented to him. But that's enough.

TRIP TO THE NORTH-CAPE

CHAPTER ONE.
Departure from Helsinbourg. Gottembourg, and the customs of its inhabitants. Trolhatta canal. Stockholm. Description of this city. Nature, and customs of the Swedes.

Mr. Acerbi , starting the story of his Journey, takes off from Helsinbourg heading to Gottembourg. This is the second largest city in Sweden, very mercantile. It counts 15 thousand souls; and in its interior it closely resembles Dutch cities. It then lies on terribly sterile soil, covered with small rocks similar to basalt. It is said that one lives there more pleasantly than in Stockholm, finding urbanity, hospitality, and no hindrance of formality and etiquette everywhere. Women are beautiful, graceful, lovable, and talkative [10]very pleasant. When a person is invited to lunch in Gottembourg, it is customary for him to stay in that house all evening and enjoy a good dinner. This is practiced throughout Sweden. Another custom is that when one sits down at the table, everyone should pray a prayer in a low voice; and so does another in getting up. In ceremonial lunches, the Swedes spin a large silver cup full of Sciampagna wine, of which everyone tastes while making a toast. This is done with certain ceremonies, of which strangers are previously warned. Whoever accidentally fails to conform to it should drink the whole cup.

50 miles from Gottembourg, on the road to Stockholm, we meet the Trolhatta canal, a superb masterpiece of human daring. It is opened by force of gunpowder in the midst of very hard rocks, to establish communication between the North Sea and Lake Wennern, the largest lake in Sweden, 89 miles long and 49 wide. navigation to the cataracts of the Gotha river; and it is three miles long, 36 feet wide, and in some places more than 50 deep, with 9 locks, and several basins. The view of this canal, and the appearance [11]of the cataracts, which have been avoided by means of it, form a surprising spectacle; and with good reason a great book is kept in Trolhatta, in which strangers are invited to write their names, and a few sentences alluding to the impression that cataracts and other surrounding objects have made on their souls. Among the many inscriptions, that Mr. Acerbi read there, one was this: God bless this good and valiant nation! and Kosciusco was undersigned there .

From Gottembourg to Stockholm the countryside is cultivated, as well as throughout Sweden, with rye, oats, peas, broad beans, and a little barley. In Scania, which is called the paradise of Sweden, a little wheat is also grown. Mr. Acerbi arrived in Stockholm on the evening of the 19th of September 1798.

We must not be silent about the surprise at which he and his traveling companion were struck, when the following morning they went to present some commendatory letters, of which they had been provided. They found that the people to whom they were headed knew all their business, that is, their arrival, the kind of carriage, which they had used, the route they had made, the accommodation they had taken, the names, and the quality of their servants, the dress they wore, [12]and many and many similar peculiarities. The capital of Sweden in this way came to announce itself to them with the gossip of the smallest towns.

But few cities, meanwhile, are situated in Europe as well as Stockholm, both for the occurrences of trade, and for the delight that the variety of objects which its contours offer. It lies on seven or eight islands, all of which are surrounded by fresh waters descending from Lake Malar, as by salty waters flowing from the sea. Almost all of them have their own particular name; and that of Blasiiholmen is famous in history, today attached to the continent, for the horrible event that occurred in 1386 under the reign of Albert. Two atrociously persecuted factions then, that of the Cappelli, and that of the Berrette; and the first made two hundred Swedish patriots burn alive in the second !! - Stockholm's appearance is superb, especially looking from the so-called bridge of the North. All at once an extraordinary mass of bell towers, palaces, cliffs, trees, lakes, canals is presented to the eye, crowned by the castle which dominates the whole city; and the whole city from that bridge reveals how long and wide it is, and the whole facade, however, can be seen minutely of that castle, whose architecture is [13]simple, noble, majestic, without any of those useless ornaments, which disfigure so many great similar factories. The astonished imagination at such a prospect can scarcely sustain such an enchantment; and while she is so keenly struck by the immense picture she has before her, where luxury, arts, commerce, industry seem to have come together to surprise the senses, the crash of the waves rushing through the arches of the aforementioned bridge, gives this spectacle a certain wild character, which takes away any comparison.

In the winter this spectacle changes. The ice makes all the barriers disappear, which in the summer the waters place between the inhabitants. No more islands: a single plain presents itself, without any obstacle, open to sledges, wagons, carriages, carriages of every kind, which run, fly in every direction, and meet, and never cross each other. touch each other; such is the speed with which they avoid each other; and you see them wandering around vessels, and ships of all kinds, motionless in the middle of the ice. On that ice then there is an immense people, which runs gliding with the speed of lightning; that in a moment appears, and escapes. The waters that bathe the King's stables, and those that rush under the arches of the [14]bridge of the North, are the only ones that take away the rigors of winter. They boil, gurgling, and rise in white froth, changing majestically in the atmosphere into vapors, which then condensed into a crystal powder, present to the surprised gaze a real shower of diamonds, which the sun's rays tinge with the brilliant colors of the mouse, of the ruby, and other precious stones. Southern townspeople will find it hard to believe that Stockholm's beauty receives more luster from winter; and may the comforts and delights of winter life increase there. It is difficult to say how many jokes, how many varieties of appearances the ice produces, which everywhere in so many different ways sticks to walls, roofs, trees, wagons, to everything, whether it is immobile or moved.

No less singular is the stay in Stockholm in the summer. In the long days of that season, when the twilights, making the night disappear in a certain way, dispense from consuming oil or wax, the well-to-do go to the countryside, and stay there until autumn. So off all economy; and you live there with more luxury and grandeur than in the city. The homes of the lords in the countryside, as well as the amenity of the site, are embellished by all means [15]of art, and equipped with all the comforts: among which there is no shortage of greenhouses, in which peaches, pineapples, grapes, and other delicate fruits can ripen, in spite of the climate. Wines of every kind, rare liqueurs, and other such highly prized things are lavished on the tables of gentlemen, rich manufacturers and merchants. Neither the ceremonies nor the formolarii that are used in the city take place there. - This beautiful liberty is especially enjoyed in the houses of merchants: the nobles are somewhat more demure; and those very many who stand still in the country, also hold great importance to the vanity of their rank.

Stockholmers still use to make races or by car, or by water or side dishes; mainly at the Royal Park, Moiksdal, Haga, Drottingholm, and Carleberg. Drottingholm, that is, the Queen's Island, is six miles away from Stockholm on Lake Malar: it is a well situated, superbly constructed, magnificent palace, and adorned with vast gardens. It is decorated with various statues of men and animals, and some beautiful vases, most part of the style of the school of Florence, taken away from Prague in the famous war of the Thirty Years. In this palace there is a rich library, a cabinet of natural history, one of medals [16]ancient and modern, and a gallery of original paintings from the Flemish, Dutch and Italian schools. There is another full of paintings representing the battles and victories of the Swedish kings and princes. About the library, among various MSS. curious there is one by the famous Queen Christina, entitled Mélanges de pensées , on a page of which Charles XII wrote by his own hand, while still a child, to win, aut mori .

One would believe that in Stockholm an Italian would die of cold in the winter. I, says Mr. Unripe , I can assure you that although sometimes the thermometer of Celsius, a Swedish naturalist physicist, who accompanied Maupertuis in his trip to Keugis, if he marked the cold at 24 degrees below the freezing point, I suffered less from the severity of the cold, than that which sometimes suffered him in Italy. Ingeniously constructed stoves are placed everywhere, which with very little fuel diffuses as much heat as is needed. There is no economy of clothes, that those used by eight or ten Swedes would fill an antechamber. I have seen Frenchmen, hostile to furs, put on up to three frock coats. Two pairs of gloves, calosce, a cane, are indispensable when you go out on foot.

[17]
In general the Swedes are beautiful; but beautiful in the use of the North: that is, of an expressionless physiognomy. Since the men of the village are not very gallant, they spend the whole day either alone or with other women; and their conversation, whatever their upbringing, is without interest; and taking great care to dress in every way, they do what they do to surpass the others in elegance and panache, rather than out of desire to please, or to make conquests. However, they love homage, and praise; and they put a lot of importance into being called the beauties of the North. Their predominant passion is to obtain distinction, and public regard: and it is by this means that they come to inspire them with feelings of tenderness, friendship, love, of which they are finally as capable as those who live in warmer climates. .However, the reserve observed among high-ranking Swedish women is not found among those of inferior status; and this arises from being these in different circumstances. Not being party women in Stockholm, as one finds in the other great cities of Europe, men have favored, who claim to have a certain rank in society; and it is indeed necessary to sigh, and to court such women for some time to become fond of them. Except in spite of theirs [18]demeanor end up having two or three lovers at a time. And it is not strength of temperament that leads them to this: it is avarice. But together they are extremely jealous of external forms of consideration; and from their friends and favorites they demand attention, of which a stranger rightly marvels. Woe to that lover of theirs who hesitates to greet them in a public place, or to kiss their hand! The ease of having open relations with this lot of women without public morality being offended, means that jealousy is not known in Sweden.

In Sweden the whole day is devoted to business; and in the evening at the game: rarely is it spent with women. The game for the Swedes is a universal and furious passion. Relate the following case. One of the most distinguished gentlemen saw one day the lunch hour passed without any beginning of the usual preparations appearing; and he went down to the kitchen to find out where it came from. He found all his people occupied so strongly in a game of games that no one had noticed that the lunch hour had passed. The house master kept in agreement with the others; and he got in the way, begging him Your Excellency to tolerate a little bit, since the game was about to end. The gentleman surrendered to the instance: but he wanted the master to [19]house went to set the table; and he himself took his place, continuing the game with the others !!

Neighbors of the Swedes call them the Gascons of Scandinavia. This imputation, the effect of jealousy and antipathy, which so many times have disunited peoples, which nature and their interests wanted indeed to be intimately united with each other, means nothing more, except that the Swedes are animated by the desire for glory. , and from that of standing out above the other qualities which generally predominate in the hearts of all valiant, generous, and daring peoples. Sweden is full of scientific and literary establishments; and has had, and has men of distinguished merit. With the exception of Ireland, Scotland and Geneva, there is no country in Europe in which education is generally as widespread among the people as in Sweden. We are taught to read, to write, and to make accounts to everyone, yes in the cities and in the villages, yes in any smaller group of villagers, without exception, or distinction. To this general education the Swedish villagers owe their fine qualities which distinguish them, their frankness, loyalty, cheerful humor, hospitality, good heart, courage, and wit.

Beyond the academies of sciences, of letters and [20]of arts, Sweden also has several universities; and it is a difficult problem to unravel this, if any other nation had ever made so much progress in the sciences, and in the liberal and mechanical arts, when it had, like Sweden, to triumph over soil, climate, domestic strife, and jealousy of proud and powerful neighbors.

[21]

CHAPTER II.
Departure from Stockholm for Grisselhamn. Condition of those who make this trip. Crossing on the sea ice and accidents that occurred. Marine calves. Swedish villager and his arguments. Aland Islands and their inhabitants.

On March 16, 1799, Mr. Acerbi left Stockholm about 7 hours, well wrapped he and his companions in Russian bearskin furs, with his head, hands and legs protected by a hat, gloves and boots lined with skins, to defend themselves from the cold, welcomed by villagers' sledges, the car better suited than any other, and which they were sure of being able to find at any post office as far as Abo. They arrived in the evening in Grisselhamn, a village about 69 miles from Stockholm. They found nothing notable in this race for a ground that was neither mountainous, nor totally flat, except for a quantity of foxes, one stationary, the other quietly moving on the snowy surface, without fear, and without mistrust of fate: only that, while undeterred they watched our sleds at the moment [22]that these passed or stopped, they fled. To make them stop, it was enough to draw a whistle, which then turned back; and fixed their eyes on whoever had whistled.

Anyone traveling from Stockholm to Grisselhamn, says Mr. Unripe , he doesn't have to think about lunch, snack, or sleep. The reason is clear: all along this street there is no shadow of a tavern; and the villagers, whose huts we meet, are poor people, who have no more than bread, milk and cold cuts: things that travelers cannot appreciate much. The bread is in the form of bracciatelle, made of rye and barley, and very insipid: then the apples of earth are rare, as they have not until now learned the easy way to preserve them from frost. Beer and brandy are luxury items for them. Therefore, in addition to that bread and milk, they are content with salted meat, or with salted or smoked fish.

Grisselhamn is a small post town, where both in winter and in summer travelers stop on their way from Sweden to Finland. In winter, the passage by sea is dangerous, if the season is not very mild; and instead you have to go to Tornea by land. Nothing notable is in Grisselhamn; I don't trade, [23]no factories, no house to stay in; and the only house that is made of bricks is that of the postmaster, surrounded by wooden huts.

When a traveler wishes to spend the winter in Finland, crossing the gulf on ice, the villagers oblige him to double the number of horses he had on reaching Grisselhamn. We therefore had to conform to the use, which is otherwise not an anger, but the effect of a prudent precaution. This formidable crossing over an immense plain of ice is 43 miles, 30 of which are done without touching land. Such a voyage over such a vast expanse of frozen sea offers an extraordinary glance to an inhabitant of southern countries; and I confess that before I met him, he had a very false idea of ​​it. He was simply expecting me to have a plain flowing without any limit other than that of the horizon, whose uniform appearance would inspire me with an annoying melancholy, and whose surface would present me no danger. But how and how much my surprise, admiration, mixed with restlessness, and I will say terror, grew as we moved away from the place from which we had started! This frozen sea, at first [24]all smooth as a crystal, it became insensibly uneven, harsh, undulating, as it expressed the waves, which had furrowed its surface. One could see, so to speak, the hand of winter, which, having touched the foaming water, had in an instant stopped it, hardened it, converted it into ice; and the breakers made of ice, which earlier the storm raised furiously: in various sites those breakers piled one on top of the other, presented the appearance of enormous cliffs, whose steep fronts, as if suspended in the air, took on the resemblance of pyramids and of spiers, and threatened to fall below, and to cover everything under their ruins. Therefore, as far as the eye could discern, only colossi of a transparent crystal could be seen, broken and scattered, where covered with very white snow, where shining by the reflected light,Nor were the difficulties, few the efforts that the conductors and the horses had to encounter in order to find the road often lost in the midst of the many turns and diversions, which they were obliged to do to avoid those groups of ice, which here and there they arose to cross our path. In spite of then [25]of all the cares of prudence, and of all the precautions of fear, at every instant our sleds overturned; and the one, now the other, served as a signal to the caravan to stop. But a circumstance impossible to foresee increased our dangers. The sight of our long furs made of wolves or Russian bears, and the odor which exhaled from them, frightened some of the horses so much, that it drew them into a fury. This happened singularly when we overturned the sled and needed to get out of it to straighten it, we came to approach the horses, which because of those furs, confusing us with the animals from which they were drawn, struggled between the poles and the reins, bit the brake, tried in every way to flee to the immense fright of travelers and conductors. At that juncture the villager for fear of losing his horse in the midst of such a desert, chained himself, I will say so, to the bridle; and rather than parting with the horse, at the cost of his life he let himself be dragged along by those pieces of ice, the points of which often opened large wounds on his limbs; and he lasted in that most fatal condition, until the horse tired from him, useless efforts, and discouraged by the growing [26]obstacles, stopped. Then we went back into the sleds, while the conductor, instructed by the experience, finally took the precaution of blindfolding the horse. But one of these animals, the wildest and most fiery of the caravan, escaped frightened; and he touched us to see his poor conductor, who after having allowed himself to be dragged through the ice for a long run, unable to resist the pains that tore him, abandoned his bridle. Free then that horse doubled the speed of the race; for the noise that the sled made by bouncing between the ice, which he drew with it, increasing his fear, seemed to lend him real wings to escape. We followed him for a long time with his eyes, as he went inside himself in the horizon; and we saw it from time to time on the summits of the frozen waves like a black spot, which insensibly dwindled, until at last it disappeared altogether. Then then we knew how prudence wanted us to have a few more horses for such occurrences; and we knew at the same time in the dangers of that crossing how much such a precaution had been neglected. The owner of that horse mounted a spare sled, hoping to find him running in the tracks of [27]it; and we continued our journey to the islands of Aland, taking, as far as we could, the medium of the smoothest steps, but not without being overturned again, and without still being in danger of losing one or the other. another of our horses: which would have put us in extreme embarrassment.

One can hardly imagine the sadness that infuses the loneliness of that immense field of ice. In such a vast space no living being presented itself to our gaze; not man, not quadrupedal, not volatile: there nature was dead. What abandonment! what isolation! what a silence! Sometimes winds in contrast with each other, colliding impetuously on those frozen cliffs, produced a deep whistle, which spread through space, and was extinguished there: sometimes the air condensed in those frozen masses violently opened a road, and broke them with horrible a rumble, which in a moment broke the gloomy silence frighteningly, and in a moment that silence was restored, and became more terrible. To so many causes of melancholy that oppressed the soul, to so many dangers that multiplied at every step, we must add the frequent encounter of deep cracks, which present to the eye the abyss of the waters covered with ice. Desolating [28]it is the appearance of those cracks, especially because you do not wait; and some oblige us to build a bridge of boards to cross them.

We have said that in these horrible solitudes all of nature presents itself as dead. This is not correct. There are living creatures who love their stay; and these are the seals, or rather, the sea calves. In the caves of the ice they lay the fruits of their loves; and they teach their little ones to endure the rigors of the harshest season. The mothers lay them there naked at all, as they were born; and the fathers take care to make sure of some opening, through which they can have prompt communication with the water. When a hunter appears, they run to save themselves, their females, their offspring on that path. Out of that danger, through that opening they go to get food for themselves and for the family; and this food is fish. The way in which the males make that opening is singular. Neither teeth nor legs have any part: they only use their warm breath, which they diligently and with intense perseverance direct on the same point, in order to melt the ice. The villagers of the neighboring islands are the fiercest enemies of these beasts; for when they discover a few, they ambush a [29]some distance, flattened behind a boulder of ice; and armed with a gun and a stick, they wait for the seal seen descending into the water, knowing that it must return upstairs to breathe. That's when they throw at her, and kill her. And as it sometimes happens that the water in the hole freezes as soon as the animal has come out of it, then they run over it with sticks, not giving it time to open the door to the water using its breath. In this assault so dangerous for him, the animal employs all the courage that nature has given it: it bites the attackers' sticks with its teeth, and sometimes attacks the very people themselves. But the hunter laughs at his resistance; much more than the sealshe is too slow in her movements; and the constitution of her limbs renders her unfit to operate on a solid surface.

After much effort, and some less important adventures, we let our horses rest halfway along the way; and finally we boarded the small island called Signilskar. It is entirely naked, and inhabited only by a few villagers and by a telegraph office placed there to correspond with that of Grisselhamn, the first to be established in Sweden. This islet is one of many, [30]scattered in that part of the gulf collectively take the name of Aland. Signilskar is approximately 35 miles straight from Grisselhamn. But the tour we had had to take on our journey had taken us perhaps ten more.

We were about to leave Signilskar when we saw the horse returning, which had fled. That animal was sorry for the miserable state in which after such a tear he found himself. But he was still proud as before, and as before intolerant of the sight and smell of our furs. We had to try to stay away from him so that he wouldn't get worried again.

Crossing the islands of Aland you will find houses, where you can get new horses; and we travel partly on the ice of the sea, and partly on the snow that covers the ground. Between the two posts of Heralsby and Skorpas, the famous fortress of Castelholmen is located on a cliff, all surrounded by water except where a tongue of land attaches it to the island. This fortress occupies several pages of Swedish history.

Between the islands of Vergata and Kumlinge we had as a guide a villager of about 55 years, who surprised us as much by the decency and cheerfulness of his conversation, as by the good [31]sense of his remarks. He, very different from his compatriots, constantly taciturn and unable to give the slightest hint of curiosity to travelers, with a rare civilization for a man of his condition and those climates, he went asking us many questions about our country, about the situation. of it, on the nature of the government, on the climate, on natural productions and above other interesting subjects. The pleasure we felt in hearing him equaled the surprise of his intelligence. And having heard that we were from Italy, he showed some astonishment, adding at the same time that he knew that Italy was then involved in a great war; and that a warrior who frightened everywhere was running victorious. Everyone understands who he was talking about. We asked him how many miles he believed that Italy was far from Aland; and he confessed that he could not tell us; but he believed that Italy was much farther than Denmark. And when we told him that Italy was three hundred good Swedish leagues beyond Denmark, he looked at us with great surprise; and after a short silence he replied that he did not conceive what reasons would lead us to come to his country of him, and to spend so many risdalleri in post office. His speeches were particularly striking and to spend a lot of risdalleri in post office. His speeches were particularly striking and to spend a lot of risdalleri in post office. His speeches were particularly striking [32]on the clergy, whom he took pleasure in ridiculing with that vein of good humor which is the ordinary symptom of good judgment. He was a great admirer of Gustavo III , with whom he told us he had a conversation; and there is no doubt that he did not amuse him. Nor ever losing sight of his favorite subject of his, that is, of satirizing the clergy, did he constantly go back to it on the grounds that he had no digression, which we had the pleasure to listen to. Gustavo III, he said, he was a great man, a great king; and yet he did not expect half the respect and veneration that our clergy demand of us. This clergy preaches humility; but meanwhile he pushes pride beyond what it can ever be believed. Our parish priests enjoy good benefits; live in blissful tranquility; and in order not to have disturbances they take poor priests to the day, to do for them on Sundays what they should do themselves. As for them, they do nothing but lie quietly on their loved ones, and receive the homage of the villagers who pass near them. And know well that their idleness must not be attributed to little capacity and doctrine; for if any question arises about the payment of tithes, dictate that it be [33]they put on the product of our sweat, they quickly make themselves known to the most learned and sensible men of the world. Nor are they just good arithmetic; but they know more about all the laws, all the edicts, and all the statutes of the kingdom.
