Master Alfredo L'Ambert, before receiving the fatal blow that forced him to change his nose, was, without a doubt, the most notable notary in France. At that time he was thirty-two years old; he was tall, and had large, slanted eyes, a clear, Olympian forehead, and his beard and hair were an admirable blond. His nose (the most prominent part of his body), twisted majestically into the shape of an eagle's beak. Believe me or not, his crisp white tie looked great on him. Was this because he had used them from his earliest childhood, or because he stocked up on them at some famous store? I think it was both reasons at the same time.

It is one thing to tie a crooked white pocket handkerchief around your neck, and quite another to form, with art and perfection, a splendid knot of immaculate cambric, whose equal ends, not excessively starched, are directed symmetrically to the right and left. left. A wisely chosen and neatly knotted white tie is not an unattractive adornment; all women will tell you the same as me. But it is not enough to tie it with mastery and delicacy; it is also necessary to know how to wear it; this is a matter of practice. Why do workmen look so clumsy and clumsy on the day they get married? Because they usually wear a white tie for the wedding ceremony without prior preparation.

One immediately gets used to wearing the most exorbitant headdresses: a crown, for example. The soldier Bonaparte picked up one that the King of France had dropped in the Place de Louis XV: he put it on himself, without anyone having given him any lessons, and Europe declared that the headdress did not suit him very badly. Buoyed by success, he soon introduced the fashion of crowns to his family circle and his intimates. Everyone around him pinned it on him, or so they pretended. But this extraordinary man was never more than a mediocre tie holder. The Viscount of C***, author of several prose poems, had studied diplomacy well, that is, the art of putting on a tie successfully.

He attended, in 1815, the review of our last army, a few days before the Waterloo campaign; And do you know what most caught his attention at that heroic party in which the desperate enthusiasm of a great people overflowed? That Napoleon's tie was not properly knotted.

Few men, in this peaceful terrain, could have measured themselves against Master Alfredo L'Ambert. L'Ambert was signed, and not Lambert, by virtue of an agreement of the Council of State. Mr. L'Ambert, his father's successor, worked as a notary by right of inheritance. It had been more than two centuries since this illustrious family passed on, from man to man, the studio on the Rue de Verneuil with the highest clientele in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.

The position had not been quoted, since it had never left the family; but, judging by the profits of the last five years, it was not possible to evaluate it at less than three hundred thousand scudi. That is to say, he produced an annual average of about ninety thousand pounds. For more than two centuries, all the eldest sons of the family had known how to wear a white tie with as much ease as ravens wear their best black feathers, drunks wear their purple noses, or poets wear their shabby clothes. Legitimate heir to a name and a fortune, young Alfredo had sucked elegance and distinction from his mother's breasts, as well as his good principles. He despised as much as they deserve the political innovations introduced in France after the catastrophe of 1879. In his opinion, The French nation was made up of three classes: the clergy, the nobility, and the commonwealth. Respectable opinion and shared today even by a small number of senators. He modestly placed himself in one of the top positions of the common state, not without substantiating certain secret pretensions to form with the nobility. He felt a deep contempt for the bulk of the French nation, that overcrowding of workers and peasants that receives the name of people, or vile plebs. She tried to rub against him as little as possible, out of respect for his kind person, whom he cared for and loved passionately. Healthy, slender and vigorous as a river sow, he was convinced that this rabble was a kind of trash created by Providence expressly to feed the sow lords.

Otherwise, a nice man, like all egoists; esteemed in the Palace, in the circle, in the chamber of notaries, in the conferences of Saint Vincent de Paul and in the hall of arms; good point and tailstock shooter; excellent drinker and generous lover, while he had an interested heart; faithful friend of the men of his rank; good-natured creditor, while he collected interest on his capital; delicate in his tastes, dapper in his dress, clean as a newly minted louis, and assiduous on Sundays at the services of St. Thomas Aquinas, and on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at the Opera: he would have been the most perfect gentlemanof his time, both physically and morally, except for a deplorable myopia that condemned him to wear glasses. Is it necessary to add that her glasses were gold and the finest, lightest and most elegant that ever came out of the workshops of the famous Mateo Luna, from the Plateros wharf?

He didn't always wear them, only putting them on in his office, or at his clients' house, when he had to read some writing. Needless to say, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, when entering the temple of the dance, he was very careful to unmask his beautiful eyes. No biconcave crystal veiled on such occasions, the enchanting brilliance of her pupils. It is very true that she did not see drop, and that she sometimes greeted a figure taking her for a star; but he always marched with the resolute air of an Alexander entering Babylon. That's why the girls from the dance corps, who take pleasure in putting on people, had baptized him with the nickname of Vencedor . A very fat Turk, secretary of the embassy of his country, was known among them by the nickname of quiet ; a councilor of state was called Melancholic ; a general secretary of the ministry of***, very lively and boisterous, was known as M. Turlu , and for this reason Elisita Champagne, also known as Champagne II, received the name of Turlurette when she left the corypheums to rise to the rank of subject.

The preceding paragraph is going to give my provincial readers a lot to think about (if I am lucky enough to get this story past the fortifications of Paris). I am hearing from here the thousands of questions that direct the author mentally. "What is meant by the temple of dance? And by dance body? And for opera stars? And for choruses? And by subjects? And for figures? What general secretaries are those who rub elbows with such people, in exchange for them putting slaps on them? And, finally, by what strange chance would a man of position and solid principles, like Señorito Alfredo L'Ambert, attend the temple of dance three times a week?»

Wow, dear friends! precisely because he was a man of position and solid principles. The temple of dance was, in those days, a large square hall, surrounded by old red velvet banquettes, in which the most distinguished men of Paris met. It was attended not only by bankers, general secretaries and councilors of state, but even dukes and princes, deputies and prefects, and the most supportive senators of the temporal power of the Pope; only the prelates were missing. Married ministers were seen in it, and even the most married of all ministers. By saying that they were seen I do not mean that I have seen them myself; Of course you will understand that the poor journalists did not enter that place as in the mill. A minister held in his hands the keys to that hall of the Hesperides, and no one could enter it without His Excellency's permission. That's why they had to do with rivalries, jealousies and intrigues! How many cabinets have been demolished under the most diverse pretexts, but, deep down, because all the statesmen had the pretense of reigning in the temple of dance! Do not imagine, however, that all these characters came to that place attracted by the bait of illicit pleasures! His intention was limited to promoting an eminently aristocratic and political art. that all these characters came to that place attracted by the bait of illicit pleasures! His intention was limited to promoting an eminently aristocratic and political art. that all these characters came to that place attracted by the bait of illicit pleasures! His intention was limited to promoting an eminently aristocratic and political art.

The passing of the years may have changed all this, because Master L'Ambert's adventures do not date from last week. This does not mean, however, that they go back to any antediluvian epoch; but reasons of high convenience prevent me from specifying the exact date on which this ministerial official changed his aquiline nose for a straight nose. That is why I said in those times , speaking in a vague way like the fabulists. Be content to know that the action takes place at a certain epoch in the annals of the world, between the burning of Troy by the Greeks and that of the summer palace in Peking by the English army: two memorable stages of European civilization.

A contemporary and client of Senorito L'Ambert, the Marquis of Ombremule, said at the Cafe Ingles one evening:

—What distinguishes us from common men is the fanaticism we feel for dancing. The scoundrel goes out of his way for music. She gets tired of applauding when she listens to the operas of Rossini, Donizetti and Auber: it could be said that a million notes, mixed up in a tasty salad, have an I don't know what that flatters the ears of these people. They carry their ridiculousness to the point of singing themselves, with their hoarse, shrill voices, and the police allow them to gather in certain amphitheaters to smash up some arias. Good luck to them! As for me, I never stop to listen to an opera; I am content to look at her; I'm going to see the plastic part, which is the only part that amuses me, and I'll leave later. My respectable grandmother has told me that all the pompadour ladies of her time only went to the Opera attracted by the dance, and they did not shy away from their applause for the dancers. We, in turn, protect the dancers: damn him who thinks wrong!

The Duchess of Biétry, young, pretty and forgotten, had the weakness to reproach her husband for the habits he had learned at the Opera:

"Aren't you ashamed to abandon me in a box, with all your friends, to run to I don't know where?"

"Ma'am," he replied, "when there are well-founded hopes of achieving an embassy, ​​isn't it the most natural thing to study politics?"

-Agreed; but I think there will be better schools in Paris for it.

-None. Learn, my dear, that dance and politics are twin sisters. Constantly trying to please, courting the public, and always keeping an eye on the conductor, and restraining his own countenance, and changing every moment of costume and color, and jumping from left to right and from right to left, and turn quickly, and land again on your feet, and smile, finally, with eyes full of tears, is it not, in a few words, the program of dance and politics?

The duchess smiled, forgave and took a lover.

The great lords, like the Duke of Biétry, the statesmen like the Baron de F..., the great millionaires like the diminutive Mr. St..., and the simple notaries like the hero of this story, rubbed shoulders in the temple dance and behind the scenes of the theater. Given the simplicity and ignorance of these eighty naïve girls who make up the dance corps, they are all the same. They are known by the name of subscribers, they smile freely, they whisper in the corners, their candies, and even their diamonds, are accepted as gallants without consequences and that do not compromise anything to those who receive them. People wrongly imagine that the Opera is a market for pleasures and a school of debauchery. None of that: virtues are found there in greater numbers than in any other theater in Paris. Why? because virtue is more appreciated there than anywhere else.

Isn't it an interesting thing to closely study this small town of young people, almost all of them from very humble origins, and whom talent or beauty can elevate in a moment to the highest spheres of art? Little girls from fourteen to sixteen years of age, most of them fed on dry bread and green apples in a workman's garret or a porter's booth, come to the theater in tartan dresses and old shoes, and his first care is to run to change his suit, without anyone noticing. A quarter of an hour later, they come down to the temple of the dance splendid, radiant, covered in silk, gauze and flowers, all at the expense of the State, and brighter than the angels, fairies and houris of our dreams. The ministers and the princes kiss their hands and stain their irreproachable black suits with the white lead that they carry in their arms. New and old madrigals are recited to their ears that they only sometimes understand. Some tend to have natural talent and are a pleasure to talk to. They don't last there very long.

An indiscreet chime calls the fairies to the theater; the crowd of subscribers accompanies them to the entrance of the stage, retains them and entertains them behind the moving wings. There is a virtuoso of these who defies falling decorations, oil stains, oil lamps and the most diverse miasmas for the pleasure of hearing these charming words murmur in a hoarse little voice:

-Devil! How my feet hurt!

The curtain rises and the eighty ephemeral queens flutter joyfully under the ardent gazes of an enthusiastic audience. Each one of them sees, or thinks she can guess, two, three, ten more or less well-known worshipers. How much they enjoy while the curtain remains up! They consider themselves beautiful, they are richly dressed, they see all the twins fixed on their persons, they feel the admiration they produce and they do not have to fear whistles or criticism.

Finally, twelve o'clock at night strikes and the decoration changes as in fairy tales. Cinderella climbs with her older sister, or with her mother, to the cheap peaks of Batignolles or Montmartre. The poor thing limps a bit! Filthy mud splashes on her gray stockings. The excellent mother of a family who has pinned all her hopes on this dear daughter, does not stop, along the way, instilling in her wise maxims of moderation and morality.

—Always walk straight along the path of life, my daughter—he tells her—be careful not to stumble! But if the implacable fate has that misfortune in store for you, be very careful not to fall on a bed of roses!

These prudent advices are not always listened to. Sometimes the heart is stronger than the head, and dancers have been seen married to dancers. There are cases of young women, beautiful as the Venus of Anadyomene, giving up a hundred thousand francs in jewels to join at the altar with a clerk of two thousand. Others abandon the care of their future to chance and make their families despair. Some wait for April 10 to dispose of their hearts, because they have sworn to themselves to be judicious until they are seventeen years old. Others find a protector of her taste and do not dare to confess it to him: they fear the revenge of a referendum advisor who has sworn to kill her, and commit suicide immediately, if she loves someone other than him. Of course she said it as a joke, as you can understand; but in this special world words are taken seriously. What supine ignorance and simplicity is that of these girls! There are those who have heard two sixteen-year-olds argue about the nobility of their origin and the social category of their respective families.

—Look at the impertinent one!—said the oldest of them;—your mother's earrings are silver and my father's are gold!

Maese Alfredo L'Ambert, after having fluttered from the brunette to the blonde for a long time, had ended up falling in love with a pretty brunette with blue eyes. Miss Victorina Tompam was honest, as one generally is at the Opera, until she stopped being so. She excellently educated, on the other hand, she was incapable of adopting an extreme resolution without first consulting her parents. From about six months here, she was constantly besieged closely by the handsome notary and by Ayvaz-Bey, the corpulent twenty-five-year-old Turkish man, whom we have said was designated with the hint of Tranquilo. Both had given him very reasoned speeches, in which his future played an important role. The respectable Mrs. Tompain had, however, managed to keep her daughter in the middle, hoping that one of her rivals would decide to put the matter in the form of business. The Turk was a good boy, honest, decent and shy. This notwithstanding, he spoke at last, and was heard.

Everyone was immediately informed of this little event, except Monsieur L'Ambert, who had gone to Poitou to attend the funeral of an uncle of his. When she returned to the Opera, Miss Victorina Tompain had a diamond bracelet, some diamond studs, and a heart also made of diamonds, hanging from her neck like a parlor chandelier. We have already said at the beginning that the notary was myopic; so he could see nothing that he must have noticed at once, not even the mischievous smiles with which he was greeted at his entrance. She went round and round, chattering incessantly happily, and dazzling everyone, as always, with her proverbial elegance, impatiently awaiting the completion of the ball and the departure of the girls. Her calculations had been fulfilled:

What is known in Paris by the name of the Opera passage is a network of more or less narrow galleries, more or less lit, on very different levels, linking the boulevard, Lepeletier, Drouot and Rossini streets. A long corridor, mostly uncovered, stretches from Rue Drouot to Rue Lepeletier, usually to the Barometer and Clock galleries. In its lowest part, a few steps from rue Drouot, the false door of the theater opens, the night entrance of the artists. Every two days, around midnight, a wave of three or four hundred people tumultuously passes before the vivacious eyes of worthy Papa Monge, concierge of this paradise. Drivers, troupes, extras, choristers, male and female dancers, tenors and sopranos, authors, composers, administrators and subscribers go out together in the street in a confused whirlwind. Some go down to rue Drouot, others climb the stairs that lead, through an open gallery, to rue Lepeletier.

In the middle of the open passage, at the end of the Barometer gallery, Alfredo L'Ambert was waiting smoking a cigarette. Ten paces further on, a round little man in a scarlet fez inhaled at equal intervals the smoke of a finger-thick Turkish tobacco cigarette. Around them, more than twenty pimps, some walking nervously, others, more calmly, on firm foot, also waited each one by his side. And the singers hummed along, and the sylphs, dragging their feet a little, limped past, and from minute to minute a female shadow, black, brown, or brown, slipped between the few gas-burners, unknown to all but his own. the eyes of love

The couples recognize each other, approach each other and leave without saying goodbye to the others. But what happens? behold a strange noise and an unusual tumult. Two shadows have sped by, two men have run, two cigarette fires have approached each other; two exalted voices have been heard and the din of a quick quarrel. The passers-by have crowded into one spot; but they haven't found anyone. Master Alfredo L'Ambert goes, completely alone, towards his carriage, which awaits him on the boulevard; and by the light of a lantern he reads, shrugging his shoulders, this business card, splattered with blood:

AYVAZ-BEY

SECRETARY OF THE OTTOMAN EMBASSY

Rue de Granelle Saint-Germain, 100.

Listen to what the dapper notary on the Rue de Verneuil was muttering:

"Damn adventure!" The devil take me if I even suspected that I had given rights to this Turkish animal!... because, well, it is!... But, why didn't I put on my glasses?... It seems that I punched him in the nose... Yes, without a doubt: his card is stained with blood, and my hand is too. Here I am facing a Turk for an unforgivable clumsiness; because I have no reason to love that poor boy badly... The girl, on the other hand, is totally indifferent to me... May she keep her in good time! Slitting two decent people's throats for Miss Victorina Tompain!... The damned punch is what can't be fixed...

This he said between his teeth, between his thirty-two teeth whiter and sharper than those of a wolf. He ordered his coachman to retire home, and he walked slowly towards the circle of the Iron Roads. There he met two friends and related his adventure to them. The aged Marquis de Villemaurin, a former captain of the Royal Guard, and the young Henri Steimbourg, a stockbroker, unanimously judged that the punch spoiled everything.
