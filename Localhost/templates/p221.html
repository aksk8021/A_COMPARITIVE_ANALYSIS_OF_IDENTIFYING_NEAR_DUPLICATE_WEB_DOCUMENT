In July 1870, I completed the third year of my studies at the Central School of Arts and Manufactures. It was the moment when the war, which was about to be declared, filled Paris with tumult and noise. In our theatres, a whole people whipped up by the excitement of part of the press, listened standing, covering it with frenzied applause, to the terrible refrain of this Marseillaise which was to lead us to so many disasters. Regiments passed along the boulevards, accompanied by the clamor of thousands of idlers who believed that battles were won with cries. The ritornello of the song of the Girondinsstrolled through the streets, chanted by the voice of the newsboys. This factitious agitation might make an inattentive observer suppose that the great city desired, called for war; the government, which wanted to be deceived, was mistaken.

A decree called into service the mobile guard of the Empire, this same mobile guard which the bad will of the soldiers who composed it, added to the blind and tenacious opposition of the left, seemed to condemn to an eternal rest. In one day she passed from the sleep of boxes to the agitated life of the camps. The Central School hastened to close its doors and to send the diplomas to those of the competitors designated by their serial number. A civil engineer for a few hours, I was a soldier and was part of the Passy battalion bearing number 13.

The mobile guard of the Seine was not yet organized, that it was already easy to recognize the evil spirit which animated it. She pushed the love of indiscipline to absurdity. Who still does not remember those noisy departures which filled the Rue Lafayette with carriages of all kinds leading to the station of the Eastern Railway battalions composed of elements of all kinds? What attitudes! what a fuss! what cries! At the sight of these bands leaving in cabs after drinking, it was easy to foresee what a sad example they would set.

My battalion left on August 6 for the camp of Chalons; they were, until the station of La Villette, where he embarked, the same cries, the same cars, the same songs. Hoarse voices were still singing at Chateau-Thierry. The station masters didn't know what to hear, the crew members were bewildered. At each new halt, there was a stampede. The moblots flew out of the cars and ran to the refreshments, some of them forgot themselves there. Those of us who had kept our composure were given lamentable tales of what had happened the night before and the days before. A certain number of these children of Paris had carried out veritable raids on the sideboards, where everything had disappeared, the dishes after the eatables; the most facetious took away the glasses and plates, which they threw, on the way, through the doors of the carriages; just to make some noise and laugh a little. Impetuous races launched the zealous officers in pursuit of the soldiers who strayed into the neighboring farms, finding it funny "to pick here and there" rabbits and hens. We stood at the windows to see them.

When I arrived at Chalons, the station and the waiting rooms, the courtyards, the sheds, were filled with cripples and wounded lying on the ground, stretched out on benches, leaning against the walls. There were the living remnants of the murderous encounters of the first days: dragoons, zouaves, chasseurs de Vincennes, turcos, soldiers of the line, hussars, lancers, all haggard, silent, gloomy, dragging what was left of their breath. No straw, no ambulance, no doctors. They were waiting for a convoy to take them. Hundreds of wagons crowded the track. It took ten maneuvers for a train to pass. The station staff no longer slept, were on their toes.

Just as we were about to leave Paris, we had had the news of these defeats, soon followed by irreparable disasters. Now I had before my eyes the bloody and mutilated testimony of those terrible shocks in the face of which we had run with such a light heart. My ardor was not diminished by it; but pity seized me by the throat at the sight of these unfortunates, many of whom were still awaiting their first dressing. What! so much misery and so little help!

The railway established for the service of the camp took the mobiles to Petit-Mourmelon, from where a first stage led them to their camp, backpacks. For a boy who, just the day before, had been traveling in Paris by car and had only tired his feet on the asphalt of the boulevard, the transition was abrupt. It was therefore not without a certain feeling of happiness that I saw the tent in which I was to take shelter, me sixteenth. The space was not immense, and a few flowing winds, which, although in the heart of summer, had November chills, passed well through the slits in the canvas and the interstices left at ground level; but there was straw, and, huddled together, using each other as heaters, the mobiles, fatigue helping, slept like soldiers.

At the first light of day, a cannon shot rang out: it was the alarm clock. Like bees coming out of hives, thousands of mobiles escaped from the tents, stretching out. One had a sore arm, the other a numb leg. The chorus of complaints began. The comic element was mingled with it in high doses; some were astonished that they had been woken up so early, others complained that they had no coffee with cream. Among these conscripts of a few days so meticulous on the question of comfort, I had noticed one who, the evening before, had seemed surprised not to find any supper prepared under the tent.

"What are we thinking of?" he exclaimed.

Eyes open, his surprise turned to indignation. Lunch did not arrive.

"If that's how we're treated," he murmured, "what will it be like in the field?"

I had no doubt that it was some son of a family, count or marquis, fallen from the Faubourg Saint-Germain in full democracy. A discreetly questioned comrade told me that the unknown gentleman had tried his hand the day before in the useful art of pulling the cord. This is, moreover, a remark that I had not the only occasion to make. The demands of the mobiles of Paris grew in inverse proportion to the positions they had occupied: all those who had had the crossroads for their residence and the garrets for their domicile uttered loud cries. The soldier's menu seemed insufficient to them; the camp items did not come from the right maker.

The spectacle presented by the camp of Chalons in the morning light lacked neither grandeur nor majesty. As far as the eye could see, the white cones of tents loomed across the plain. Their long lines disappeared in the undulations of the ground to reappear again in the depths of the horizon. A swarm of men animated this moving city which an ancient poet would have said contained the spring of the great city: sad spring which had all the weariness and drought of winter before having given the harvest. of summer! But, if the camp had that imposing grace which emanates from the broad lines, it presented drawbacks which diminished its picturesque charms. Terrible winds scoured its vast expanse and blinded us with whirlwinds of dust; the oppressive heat of the day was followed by the penetrating cold of the nights. A copious and icy dew wet the tents, and if one did not breathe at sunset, one would shiver in the morning.

"The government knows well what it is doing," said the motives; we are republicans, he kills us in detail!

The first cannon shot fired, military life took hold of the camp. The drums were beating, the bugles were sounding, and the officers who had had this fortunate chance of securing muskets for their battalions, endeavored to teach their men the drill which they did not know. We saw a good number of companies where, lacking snuffbox rifles, we practiced with sticks. Mobiles who had only their pay lived on the soldier's ordinary life. As for the sons of the family, they met at the Petit-Mourmelon, where one could find a bit of everything, from pâtés de foie gras and Champagne wine for the gourmets to bowls for the delicate.

I had a visit to Petit-Mourmelon; there reigned the din permanently. Imagine a long street whose aisles offered an endless series of cabarets, guinguettes, furnished hotels, shady shops, blind shops, cafes and restaurants, between which an incessant crowd of caps and tunics, red trousers and gold stripes. All the trade was done there, the trade in watches and the discounting of bills of exchange. Here and there the comedy was played; in other corners, people were dancing. This Petit-Mourmelon, who was like a wart in the camp, contributed not a little to maintaining and developing indiscipline. Lessons in dissipation and drunkenness were taken there. We were still conversing in the shadow of these shady establishments of the insolent reception which the battalions of Paris had given to a Marshal of France. Souls of newsboys made it a subject of glory. Perhaps an iron hand would have had to bend these characters which had been brought up in the cult of insubordination; people were wrong to believe that indulgence would bear better fruit.

A somewhat well-placed heart on which weighed the blood spilled at Reichshoffen would soon be disgusted with this platitude and this shouting. Among the young people I had known in Paris, and who, like me, were learning the profession of arms, many did not hesitate to show their feelings of indignation and suffered from their uselessness. The uniform I wore was becoming heavy on my shoulders. In the meantime, I heard talk of the 3rd Zouaves, the remnants of which were rallying the camp of Chalons. The colonel, M. Alfred Bocher, was among the wrecks of the bravest of regiments. I had known him in my childhood, my decision was taken on the spot. It was only a question of discovering the 3rd Zouaves and its colonel.

Anyone who has not seen the plateau of Châlons can believe that the discovery of a regiment is an easy thing; but, to reach it, one must have the patience of a traveler who pursues a tribe in the endless prairies of the Far West . It was at the moment when Marshal MacMahon, filled with immeasurable sadness, was assembling the army which was to disappear at Sedan after having fought at Beaumont. Everywhere soldiers and tents everywhere: a desert populated by battalions. Already this enormous group of isolated people was forming, which grew ever larger. The defeats of the preceding days widened this wound of the armies in the field. They formed a camp within the camp.

From the tents of a regiment of the line, I passed to the tents of a battalion of chasseurs from Vincennes; I fell from a squadron of cuirassiers into a squadron of hussars; I lost myself between batteries whose guns gleamed in the sun. If I asked for information, I only got vague answers. Finally, after three or four hours of walking in this solitude animated by the sound of bugles, I arrived at the encampment of the 3rd Zouaves. A few hundred men were gathered there wearing yellow drum jackets. When he left Africa, the regiment numbered nearly three thousand men. Colonel Bocher was there, seated on a folding chair, surrounded by three or four officers who were sitting on bales of straw. I named myself, and presented my request.

"Do you know what you are asking me?" he then said; it is a long series of miseries, fatigues, sufferings. All soldiers know them: but in the 3rd Zouaves they are everyday companions. My regiment has a reputation of which it is proud, but which has earned it the dangerous honor of always being the first to fire. If you give in to youthful ardour, take time to reflect.

My resolution was firmly fixed, the colonel yielded. He handed me a card with a few hastily written words authorizing me to join the active companies without going through the delays and troubles of the depot, and dismissed me. A few days later I was in Paris, where all I had to do was enlist and equip myself. It was harder than I thought. Nothing had been changed to make engagements quicker and easier. No tailor in Paris has ever used his scissors and needles to cut and sew Zouave garments. As for the regiment's official tailor, he lived in Mostaganem; finally, all the difficulties overcome, my jacket on my back and my road map in my pocket, on August 28, as a second class zouave in the 3rd regiment, I left for Rethel with a ticket which only guaranteed me a trip as far as Reims. Besides, I had neither rifle nor cartridges. All my luggage consisted of a tartan which contained two flannel shirts, three or four pairs of woolen socks and a few handkerchiefs. My fortune was hidden in a belt, where, if you looked carefully, you would have found a fair number of gold pieces.

In the compartment in which I had climbed, there was a woman wrapped in a coat who was crying under her veil and an engineer who was taking notes. My neighbor told me between two sobs that she had a son and a brother in the army. She had not heard from him for a fortnight. The engineer traveled for the destruction of works of art, such as viaducts, bridges and tunnels. He had a hundred to blow up. It was a mission of trust. His pencil fluttered on the notebook and he sometimes honored his neighbor with a modestly proud smile.

The war and its consequences, the war and its probabilities were all the talk. We had nothing to learn and we were still talking. Each traveler who ascended brought his contingent of news. Most were based on chance information. They lied no less than the despatches. Blame had a greater part in the conversation than praise. One attacked the general staff, another the intendancy. Magnificent campaign plans were improvised which had no other fault than being impracticable. Their authors returned to their business here and there; this one in his castle, this one in his shop.

At the station of Reims, where King William was not yet expected, all my traveling companions alighted. An artillery officer, who seemed to have traveled a hundred leagues across the fields, climbed up, stretched his muddy legs on the cushions, sighed, turned round, and began to snore like a battery. Around two o'clock in the morning, the convoy stopped at Rethel. It was now only a question of discovering the 3rd Zouaves. It was raining heavily, and the town was still terrified from a visit it had received the day before. Four Uhlans had taken Rethel; but, too few to guard this sub-prefecture, they left as they had arrived, slowly, in step. While discussing the chances of the return of the four uhlans with the innkeeper who had granted me the hospitality of a room and a bed, I learned that the 3rd Zouaves had been gone for three days. No one knew where he had gone. I wanted both intelligence and a gun. The morning passed in vain searches. No weapons to provide me, no information either. Sure at last that the railway was no longer working, and determined to rejoin my regiment, I obtained from a renter a car with which he undertook to take me to Mézières.

II
We had not gone half a kilometer on the road to Mézières when we already encountered groups of peasants walking with a frightened air. Some turned their heads as they hurried on. Their number increased as the car advanced. Soon the road was almost obstructed by the unfortunates who pushed their cattle in front of them, and fled, escorting long files of carts on which they had piled up utensils, some provisions and their most precious furniture. Women and children, sitting on straw and hay, wept and lamented. I thought then of the songs which had greeted the news of the declaration of war, of the nervous enthusiasm of Paris, of this fever of the first days. I was no longer at the Opera, but in the midst of desolate countryside abandoned by its inhabitants. Ruin and fire swept them away like a herd. One of these fugitives, whom I questioned on the way, replied that the Prussians were arriving in large numbers: they had cut off the road between Mézières and Rethel, and advised me to turn back. That said, he resumed his run.

Dull and distant detonations lent a more serious eloquence to the peasant's speech: it was the deep voice of the cannon which thundered in the direction of Vouziers. I had never heard it except in Paris during the festivities of the official holidays. She borrowed from the silence of the countryside and from the spectacle of this road where a disorderly crowd was fleeing, a formidable accent which sent a shiver through my veins. Later I had to familiarize myself with this noise. A farmhouse was burning nearby, and all one had to do was stand up a little to see behind the hedges the French and Prussian runners exchanging gunshots.At six o'clock in the evening the carriage reached the gates of Mézières. My first care was to go to the place where I wanted, as at Rethel, to obtain both a rifle and information on the 3rd Zouaves; but the disorder and disturbance which I had already noticed at Rethel were no less at Mézières. An employee near whom I succeeded in slipping in after long efforts, swore to me, on his files, that no one in the administration knew where the regiment I was looking for could camp at that moment. All that remained was to settle the question of the gun. My insistence seemed to greatly astonish the honest bureaucrat. Then taking on a gentle air:

"I understand your eagerness to serve your country," he went on, "that is why I urge you to leave for Lille."

"For Lille!" for Lille in Flanders?

“Yes, sir, Lille, department of the North, where a regiment is being formed which will be composed of various very well chosen elements. You will be admitted there straight away, and there you will certainly find at last that rifle which we could not procure for you either at Rethel or at Mézières. Besides, there are orders.

The interview was over; the voice of authority had just made itself heard. For a volunteer who had dreamed of finding himself face to face with the Prussians a few hours after his departure from Paris, it was neither sweet nor consoling. Instead of battle, deposit! With downcast ears, I pushed ahead sadly through the streets. Soldiers wearing all the uniforms encumbered them, coming and going, leaving the cabaret to enter the wine merchants. There was a sense of disenchantment in the air.

At nightfall, a passer-by showed me the street to which my lodging ticket pointed, and I wasted no time in knocking on the modest door of the house where I was to spend the night. A servant, her candle in her hand, led me into a kind of attic where an old, unbalanced bed took up the entire floor. This was not the time to reflect. Fatigue, moreover, had the floor, and no longer delicacy. Five minutes later I was asleep fully dressed.

Around two o'clock in the morning, however, a storm of marching bands broke out. I jumped to my feet and ran to the landing. A servant who was looking through a skylight turned around. The trumpets sounded everywhere the saddle-bottle for a departure that was to have no return. Horsemen galloped down the street; the squadrons lined up in marching order; a clanking of weapons arose mingled with the distant rolling of a car, then everything died out: the heir to an empire was heading towards the abyss!

The train which was to leave at six o'clock from Charleville station had not yet formed when I arrived. The station was filled with feverish and exhausted soldiers, among whom there were no less stragglers than sick people, and whom the beleaguered administration poured into the depots of the North and the various hospitals which still had a few beds available. The wagons were not full until nine o'clock. The remains of twenty regiments were piled up there. At half-past nine the locomotive started off heavily. Here and there clusters of madder trousers could be seen on the platforms and running boards, these standing, those lying down. From time to time, convoys loaded with soldiers, cannons and horses saluted the passing convoy as it left Mézières. It was General Vinoy's army, who was going to support Marshal MacMahon's army, and who was almost immediately to beat a retreat and shut himself up in Paris. One of these trains stopped at Harrison station about two o'clock at the same time as the one on which I had boarded. They chatted from wagon to wagon between cavalry and infantry; it was thus that I learned that a detachment of the 3rd Zouaves had just taken its place in an uphill train, and was to pass soon. I resolved to await the arrival of my unknown comrades. This is how I learned that a detachment of the 3rd Zouaves had just taken their place in an uphill train, and was to pass soon. I resolved to await the arrival of my unknown comrades. This is how I learned that a detachment of the 3rd Zouaves had just taken their place in an uphill train, and was to pass soon. I resolved to await the arrival of my unknown comrades.

At the end of four hours, the detachment of the 3rd Zouaves finally appeared.
With a bound I rushed to the lieutenant who commanded it.
-Sir? I said.

"They call me my lieutenant," replied the officer dryly; then looking at me with an already frowned eyebrow:

-What do you want? and above all be brief.

I explained my request to him in clear and precise terms.

—Come up! said the lieutenant.I suddenly sat down in a wagon where fifteen Zouaves were stretching out their gaiters. Curious glances were directed towards the newcomer, who suddenly mingled his young goatee with the fierce gathering of those red and black mustaches. The moment was critical: there was a pitfall to overcome. A magnificent pipe which I drew and which I offered to each one in turn won the hearts of my traveling companions. As a sign of adoption, they spoke to me spontaneously. About ten o'clock in the evening, the train stopped at Charleville: the detachment of the Zouaves left the wagons, and came to encamp on a promenade above the station. The influence of the pipe, the amber stem of which came out of my pocket, allowed me to enter a tent where the most cordial hospitality welcomed me on a patch of grass. my tartan, which I had not left since my departure from Paris, served me as a mattress and blanket, and I fell asleep among my comrades. When by chance I half-opened my eyes, and in the pale light of a few embers burning here and there I saw this pell-mell of legs buried in immense breeches, and heads half hidden under the red fez, silent laughter seized me. I was awakened by the dew that pierced my clothes and froze me. The Zouaves, who, in various attitudes, were snoring under the tent, shook their ears like dogs who have just received a shower, and, whistling bizarre tunes mingled with absurd couplets, set about folding up the tents and making the bags to be ready to leave at the first signal. I worked with them as best I could. Coming and going, I discovered a superb, brand new cloth hood lying on the grass and looking like an orphan. I lifted the cap, examined it, and could not deny it the praise it deserved from the double point of view of solidity and preservation.

"Whose hood?" I exclaimed, holding it suspended at the end of my arm.

"Your turn, parbleu!" exclaimed an old Zouave, seasoned to the shoulder.

I looked at him a little surprised.

"Don't you understand then?" he resumed; it is nevertheless very clear. You are entitled to a hood and you don't, which is the government's fault; however, here is one dangling between your fingers. Does anyone claim it? no; my conclusion is that it belongs to you.

And still speaking he put it on my hair. A bugle call sounded.

“It's the assembly ringing,” he added, “on the way now. The lieutenant doesn't like being kept waiting.

At half-past seven a train picked up the detachment, and the locomotive ran along the track which ended at Sedan. Here the verb to run must be taken in the most modest sense. The convoy was walking, sometimes even dragging. With one hand, the mechanic, standing on his machine, applied the brake; with his gaze he scanned the horizon. We did not know exactly where the Prussians were, and at any moment we feared to find the way cut off. Right next to the rails, below, was a road along which peasant families hurried past driven by fear and despair. Crying women were carrying little children. These unfortunates urged the escape of some cattle. We could hear the creaking of carts loaded with what they had been able to salvage. Explosions rolled through the countryside. One could see here and there, above the hedges, plumes of white smoke; all heads were at the doors. The convoy was going ahead of the battle. A mixture of anguish and impatience agitated me. At this moment a Zouave appeared on the step, and warned his comrades, on behalf of the lieutenant, that they must be ready to fire. In the blink of an eye, all the Chassepots were loaded and armed. The carriage bristled, and the locomotive took on a faster pace. In the distance, only a few black groups could be seen undulating in the plain. Sharp eyes thought they recognized the spiked helmet of the Prussians. Suddenly a shell, fired from an invisible point, sank into the embankment of the railway; another, who was following him, scratched the corner of a carriage. The convoy got off with the shock. The Zouaves responded to this aggression with a few shots fired in the direction of the black masses that could be seen in the distance. An hour later, the convoy was in sight of Sedan, and soon stopped at the station, which is situated about a kilometer from the main square. Already the Prussian battalions crowned certain neighboring heights. The walks which had tired me out at Mézières and Rethel awaited me at Sedan. I had scarcely taken a few steps into the town when a Zouave quartermaster urged me, as well as several of my comrades, to return to the station, where cases of guns had arrived, he said. I went there running. At the station, there were no boxes and no guns, but heaps of bread and heaps of bags full of biscuits.

“You don't understand a thing about it, do you? he said to me, laughing: didn't I need men of goodwill to carry off these provisions? Would you have followed me if I hadn't promised you arms?

There was nothing to reply to this reasoning. Soon bending under the weight of the sack and carrying a loaf under each arm, I took the road to Sedan, where my detachment had orders to wait in the Place Stanislas. An order came, in fact, which made him return to the Porte de Paris, by which he had entered. A dreadful noise filled the city. Aides-de-camp circulated, messengers passed carrying despatches, groups formed at street corners; a man came shouting that we had won a great victory. A few incredulous nodded. A furious cannonade continued to resound in the northeast direction of Sedan. We had the feeling that a great game was being played on that side. All ears were strained, all hearts oppressed. Suddenly a sergeant roused me from my repose, and, calling for the men who were unarmed, led me with some of my comrades to the citadel, where at last they gave us muskets. The commander of the place, who was present at this distribution, made a short speech to the Zouaves to urge them to use it bravely, and at a gymnastic step the sergeant brought us back to the Porte de Paris, where we were preparing to receive a attack. Stunned bourgeois came and went. There were long silences interrupted by dull detonations. A procession passed carrying a half-dead uhlan lying on two guns. Of these stupid and vile beings, such as are found in all crowds, rushed around the stretcher, shouting and vociferating. The wounded man's pale face did not stir; maybe do he no longer heard these insults. On his bleeding chest, which his half-open shirt showed, hung a leather plate, the sight of which intrigued me greatly. Was it, as some supposed, a kind of cuirass intended to protect the soldiers of King William against the balls of the French guns? Was it more simply a kind of solid label on which were inscribed the service number of the combatant, with those of the regiment, the battalion and the company, and who was to have it recognized in the event of death? a kind of cuirass intended to protect the soldiers of King William against the bullets of French rifles? Was it more simply a kind of solid label on which were inscribed the service number of the combatant, with those of the regiment, the battalion and the company, and who was to have it recognized in the event of death? a kind of cuirass intended to protect the soldiers of King William against the bullets of French rifles? Was it more simply a kind of solid label on which were inscribed the service number of the combatant, with those of the regiment, the battalion and the company, and who was to have it recognized in the event of death?
