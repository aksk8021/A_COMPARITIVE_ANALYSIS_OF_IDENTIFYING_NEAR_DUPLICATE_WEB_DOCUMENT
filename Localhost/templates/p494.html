1. There are two definitions of psychology, which predominate in the history of this science. According to one, psychology is "the science of the soul": psychic processes are considered as phenomena from which one must conclude the existence of a metaphysical substance, the soul. According to the other definition, psychology is "the science of internal experience", and yet psychic processes are part of a special order of experience, which is certainly distinguished by the fact that its objects belong to the " introspection ‚Äùor, as it is also said in contrast to the cognition obtained through the external senses, pertains to the internal sense.

Neither of these definitions responds to the present state of science. The first, the metaphysical definition, corresponds to a state, which for psychology lasted longer than for the other fields of knowledge. But even psychology has finally overcome it, since it has developed into an empirical discipline, which works with its own methods, and since the "sciences of the spirit" [1] are recognized to constitute a great scientific field as opposed to the natural sciences , which wants as its general basis an autonomous psychology, independent of any metaphysical theory.

The second definition, the empirical, which sees psychology as a "science-of internal experience", is insufficient, because it can [2]to give rise to the misunderstanding, that psychology has to deal with objects, which are generally different from those of the so-called external experience. Now it is certain that contents of experience are given, which fall only under psychological research, so that they are not reflected in the objects and processes of that experience, which the science of nature deals with: such are our feelings, emotions. , the resolutions of the will. On the other hand, there is no special natural phenomenon which, from a different point of view, cannot also be the object of psychological research. A stone, a plant, a sound, a ray of light are, like natural phenomena, objects of mineralogy, botany, physics, etc. But inasmuch as these natural phenomena arouse representations in us, they are at the same time objects of psychology, which thus tries to justify the formation of these representations and their relationship with other representations, as processes that do not refer to external objects, that is, to feelings and movements of the will. An "internal sense", which, as an organ of psychic knowledge, can be contrasted with the external senses as organs of knowledge of nature, does not exist at all. With the help of the external senses, representations arise, the properties of which psychology seeks to investigate, as well as those from which the study of nature begins; and the subjective excitations which remain foreign to the natural cognition of things, that is, feelings, emotions and volitional acts, are not given to us by means of special perceptive organs,

2. From what has been said, it appears that the expressions: internal and external experience do not indicate two different things, but only two different points of view , of which we use in the cognition and in the scientific treatment of the unique experience in itself. These different points of view have their origin in the immediate splitting of each experience into two factors: in a content , which is given to us, and in our knowledge of this content. The first of these factors we call the objects of experience ; the second we say knowing subject. Hence two ways take place for the study of experience. One is that of natural science , which considers objectsof experience in their nature, thought independently of the subject; the other is that of psychology ; it investigates the entire content of experience in its relation to the subject and in the qualities which are immediately attributed to it by the subject. Based on this [3]the point of view of natural science, being only possible through the abstraction of the subjective factor contained in every real experience, can also be designated as that of mediated experience while the psychological point of view, which cancels that abstraction and its effects , it can be said of immediate experience .

3. The task which thus derives from psychology as a general empirical science, coordinated and complementary to the science of nature, is confirmed by the meaning of all the sciences of the spirit, to which psychology serves as a foundation. All these sciences, philology, history, politics, sociology have as their content immediate experience, as it is determined by the reciprocal action of the objects and subjects who know and operate. These sciences of the spirit therefore do not make use of the abstractions and hypothetical subsidized concepts of the science of nature; but the objective representations and the subjective motions that accompany them have for them the value of an immediate reality and they try to explain the single constituent parts of this reality through their reciprocal connection.

3 a. Natural science, which investigates the content of experience by abstraction from the knowing subject, is also usually assigned as a task "knowledge of the external world", where the word, external world, indicates the whole complex of objects that we are given to know . In a corresponding way, psychology was sometimes defined as "self-knowledge of the subject". But this definition is insufficient, because the reciprocal relations of the subject with the external world and with other similar subjects also belong to the domain of psychology, in addition to the qualities of each subject. Furthermore, this definition can easily lead one to believe that the subject and the external world are separable parts of experience, or at least can be divided into mutually independent contents of consciousness; while on the contrary the external experience remains linked to the perceptive and cognitive functions of the subject, and the internal experience contains the representations of the external world as an immutable part of it. Hence it necessarily follows that experience is not really a simple juxtaposition of different domains, but a single whole which in each of its parts thus presupposes the subject who learns the contents of the experience, as well as the objects that are given to the subject as contained by the 'experience. And yet even the science of nature cannot entirely abstract from the knowing subject, Hence it necessarily follows that experience is not really a simple juxtaposition of different domains, but a single whole which in each of its parts thus presupposes the subject who learns the contents of the experience, as well as the objects that are given to the subject as contained by the 'experience. And yet even the science of nature cannot entirely abstract from the knowing subject, Hence it necessarily follows that experience is not really a simple juxtaposition of different domains, but a single whole which in each of its parts thus presupposes the subject who learns the contents of the experience, as well as the objects that are given to the subject as contained by the 'experience. And yet even the science of nature cannot entirely abstract from the knowing subject, [4]but only from those qualities of it, which, either as the feelings, vanish as soon as the subject is abstracted, or as the qualities of the sensations, must, on the basis of the researches of physics, be ascribed to the subject. Psychology, on the other hand, has as its object the entire content of consciousness in its immediate constitution.

If now the ultimate reason for the distinction of the natural sciences from psychology and the sciences of the spirit, can only be sought in the fact that every experience contains as factors, a given objective content and a knowing subject; it is certainly understood that that distinction does not need to presuppose a logical determination of the two factors. Indeed, it is evident that such a determination is only possible on the basis of research in the natural sciences and psychology, and yet in no case can it precede this research. The only premise from the beginning in common both to natural science and to psychology, lies rather in the conscience, accompanying every experience, which from this objects are given to a subject; without, however, one being able to speak of a knowledge of the conditions underlying this distinction between subject and object, or of certain characteristics by which one factor is distinguished from another. Even the expressions subject and object must therefore be considered in this relationship only as an anticipation for which distinctions that belong to a logical reflection already completed, are applied to the stage of the original experience.

According to what has been said, the interpretations of experience according to natural science and psychology complement each other, not only because the first considers objects abstracting as much as possible from the subject and the second instead deals with the part that the subject takes in the formation of experience, but also in the sense that both take a different position in front of every single datum of experience. Since the science of nature seeks to discover how objects are constituted without any regard to the subject, the knowledge it offers us is of a mediated or conceptual nature.instead of the immediate objects of experience, the concepts of the objects reached through the abstraction of the subjective elements of the representations are subjected to it. But this abstraction also always requires hypothetical additions to reality. In fact, since the analysis that natural science makes of experience, demonstrates many parts of the experience, eg. the contents of sensation being subjective effects of objective processes, the latter by their nature independent of the subject, cannot be understood in experience. And yet we try to reach it through hypothetical concepts on the objective properties of matter. Instead in psychology that studies the content of consciousness in its full reality,immediate or intuitive ; intuitive in the broadest sense that in modern scientific terminology has taken this concept, as well as it [5]it no longer indicates only the immediate representative contents of the external senses and mainly of the visual sense, but all the concrete reality as opposed to abstract and conceptual thought. Psychology can bring to light the connection of the data of experience as it really presents itself to the subject only by absolutely refraining from those abstractions and hypothetical concepts of which the natural sciences use. Therefore, if the science of nature and psychology are both empirical sciences in the sense that both have as their object the interpretation of experience, which they consider only from different points of view, psychology, by the particular nature of its task, is undoubtedly the most strictly empirical science .

¬ß 2. - The general guidelines of psychology.
1. The conception of psychology, as an empirical science [2] which does not have as its object a special content of experience, but the immediate content of every experience, is of modern origin. Against it there are still theories in contemporary science, which in general can be considered as a survival of previous degrees of development and which always struggle with each other according to the place they assign to psychology with respect to philosophy and the other sciences. The two main addresses of psychology, which are distinguished in relation to the two most widespread psychological definitions explained above, are: the metaphysical and the empirical. But both in turn have a good number of special addresses.

Metaphysical psychology generally gives minimal value to empirical analysis, and to the causal connection of psychic processes. Considering psychology part of metaphysical philosophy, its main aim is to arrive at a determination of the "being of the soul", which is in accord with the complex universal conception of the metaphysical system, which includes psychology. Given the metaphysical concept of the soul, one seeks from this to derive the true content of the psychological experience. The character, by which metaphysical psychology differs from empirical psychology, is that it does not derive psychic processes from other psychic processes, but from an entirely different substratum, or from the acts of a special soul substance or from the properties and processes of matter. [6]to two addresses. Spiritualistic psychology considers psychic processes as effects of a special psychic substance, which is believed to be either essentially different from matter ( dualistic system ), or of a similar nature to it ( monistic or monadological system ). The metaphysical tendency that is at the basis of spiritualistic psychology lies in the hypothesis of a supernatural essence of the soul and in the effort to reconcile this hypothesis with the other of immortality, which is sometimes connected to the more extreme hypothesis of a pre-existence. . The materialistic psychologyit leads psychic processes back to the same material substratum that the science of nature hypothetically puts as an explanation of natural phenomena. According to this psychology, psychic processes are, like the physical processes of life, linked to groupings of material elements; groupings that arise during the individual life, and dissolve with the end of it. The metaphysical tendency of this psychology lies in the denial of the supernatural essence of the soul, instead affirmed by spiritualistic psychology. But he identifies with this, as he does not seek the interpretation of psychological experience in itself, but wants to derive it from hypothetical processes of a metaphysical substrate.

2. Empirical psychology was born from the struggle against this last trend. Where it is consequently carried out, it strives to bring psychic processes back to concepts that are directly deduced from the connection of these processes, or to take advantage of well-defined and simple processes to derive from their cooperation with other more complex processes. The bases of such an interpretation can be manifold and however also empirical psychology gives rise to different directions, which can generally be distinguished for two reasons. The first refers to the relationship of internal to external experience and to the position that the two experimental sciences, the science of nature and psychology, take on each other. The second refers to their facts or concepts, from which they start out for the interpretation of the processes.

3. According to this general conception of the nature of psychological experience , those two psychological tendencies are in opposition, which have already been discussed above (¬ß 1) because of their decisive importance for the determination of the task of psychology: the psychology of the internal sense , and psychology as a science of immediate experience . The first treats psychic processes as contents of a special domain of experience, coordinated with natural experience [7]given to us by the external senses, but absolutely different from it. The second does not recognize a real difference between internal and external experience, but sees this distinction only in the diversity of points of view , from which that experience, unique in itself, is considered.

Of these two forms of empirical psychology, the first is the oldest. It arose from the aspiration to affirm independence, of psychological observation against the usurpations of the philosophy of nature. And since for its tendency it wants the science of nature and psychology to be coordinated, it believes to be the equal rights of these two sciences based first of all on the general diversity of their objects and of the forms of perception of these objects. This view has had a double effect on empirical psychology: firstly because it favored the opinion that psychology has rather to make use of empirical methods, but these are, like the data of psychological experience, fundamentally different from those of the science of nature ; in the second place because it endeavored to establish some connection between those domains of experience, already presumed to be different. Under the first respect, the psychology of the internal sense was precisely that which cultivated the method ofpure introspection (¬ß 3, 2). For the second consideration, the opinion of a difference between the physical and psychic data of the experience necessarily led back to metaphysical psychology. In fact, from this point of view, by the very nature of the thing, the relations of internal to external experience or the so-called "relations between body and soul" could only be explained by hypothetical metaphysical principles. Such metaphysical principles could not help but also influence psychological research, so that it was polluted with subsidiary metaphysical hypotheses.

4. From the psychology of the internal sense that conception is essentially distinguished, which defines psychology as the "science of immediate experience". In fact, considering the internal and external experience to be not different parts, but different ways of considering one and the same experience, it cannot recognize a primary difference between the methods of psychology and natural science. This psychological orientation first of all tried to establish the experimental methods which must carry out an exact analysis of psychic processes; an analysis which, taking into account the changed point of view, is analogous to that used by the natural sciences in explaining the phenomena of nature. More this address shows that the individual sciences of the spirit, which have as their object [8]concrete psychic processes or psychic creations are all on the same ground as a scientific consideration of the immediate data of experience and of their relations with the acting subjects. Hence, as a necessary consequence, the psychological analysis of the more general products of the spirit: language, mythological representations, the norms of customs, must be considered as an aid to the intelligence of the most complex psychic processes. This conception is therefore, with regard to method, in closer relationship with other sciences: as experimental psychology with the natural sciences, as social psychology [3] with the more special sciences of the spirit.

Finally, by considering psychology in this way, the question of the relationship of psychic objects to physicists is completely eliminated. Both are not truly different objects, but the same content, which is considered once in the research of natural science through the abstraction of the subject, and the other in psychological research in relation to its immediate constitution and its total relations to the subject. subject. All the metaphysical hypotheses on the interceding relations between psychic and physical objects are, considered from this point of view, solutions to a problem that revolves around a question falsely posed. If psychology must avoid the aid of metaphysical hypotheses in the connection of psychic processes, insofar as these are immediate data of experience, it can nevertheless - since external and internal experience are two points of view which integrate each other of one or the same experience - return, above all where the connection of psychic phenomena presents gaps, to physically consider the same processes, to see if through this new point of view, different from and taken from natural science, we can re-establish that continuity that was believed to be lacking. The same will be true then, but in the opposite sense, also for those gaps that arise in the chain of our physiological knowledge, this being able to be completed with links, provided by a treatment of the experience from a purely psychological point of view. On the basis of such a conception, which places the two forms of knowledge in their proper relationship, it is possible that not only does psychology carry out the purpose of being an experimental science, but that also physiology becomes a true subsidiary science of psychology; on the other hand, psychology is with equal right a subsidiary science of physiology.

[9]5. With regard to the second of the aforementioned (2) fundamental partitions, that is, with regard to the facts or concepts at the basis of psychological research , we can still distinguish two directions of empirical psychology, which are, generally speaking, two successive degrees of development of the interpretation psychological. The first corresponds to a descriptive tendency , the second to an explanatory one . When an attempt was made to distinguish, by describing, the various psychic processes, the need arose for an appropriate classificationof them. Thus the general concepts were formed, under which the different processes came to be ordered, and the need to interpret the single case was satisfied, referring the parts of a complex process to general concepts applicable to them. Such concepts are eg. sensation, knowledge, attention, memory, imagination, intellect, will, etc. They correspond to the general physical concepts born from the immediate knowledge of natural phenomena, such as weight, heat, sound, light, etc. If those, like these, can serve a first ordering of the facts, they do not help at all in giving an explanation. Nevertheless empirical psychology has repeatedly been guilty of this confusion, and precisely in this sense the psychology of facultieshe considered each species as powers or faculties of the psyche, under whose various or common activity it led back all psychic processes.6. An explanatory treatment , which is opposed to the descriptive psychology of the faculties, is forced, when it truly adheres to the empirical side, to place at the basis of its interpretations certain facts, which per se belong to psychic experience. And since these facts may be taken from different orders of psychic processes, the explanatory treatment again presents two directions, corresponding to the two factors that take part in the formation of immediate experience: the object and the subject. When the object of immediate experience is given greater value, intellectualistic psychology is born , which seeks to derive all psychic processes, even subjective feelings, impulses, the first movements of the will from representations ., or, as these too can be said, due to their importance for objective knowledge, by intellectual processes . If, on the other hand, primary value is given to the way in which immediate experience arises in the subject, then a direction is born, which accords subjective motions, which do not refer to external objects, an equally important place than to representations. This psychology can be called voluntary psychology , because of the importance it recognizes to the processes of the will among all the subjective processes.

[10]Among the two directions of empirical psychology (3), which are distinguished by the general conception of internal experience, the psychology of internal sense is the one that also tends towards intellectualism . Indeed, since the internal sense is compared to the external senses, it mainly considers those psychic data of experience, which are offered as objects to the internal sense, in the same way as natural objects to the external senses. On the other hand, it is believed that the nature of objects can be attributed, among all the data of experience, only to representations , and precisely because they are considered precisely as images .objects that, being outside of us, are given to us by the external senses. Therefore the representations are considered the only real objects of the internal sense, while all those processes that cannot be referred to external objects, such as eg. feelings, are indicated either as unclear representations, or as representations that refer to our body, or finally as effects produced by combinations of representations.

While the psychology of internal sense is related to intellectualism, the psychology of immediate experience approaches voluntarism. Since this recognizes the search for the subjective origin of every experience to be a capital task of psychology, it is easy to understand that in the analysis of this origin the attention must be directed above all on those factors of experience, from which the science of nature.

7. In the course of its development, intellectualistic psychology has again given rise to two special empirical directions. Either the logical processes of judging or concluding were considered as the typical fundamental forms of every psychic fact, or certain combinations of successive memory representations, prevailing over the others because of their frequency, the so-called associations of representations , were considered as such . The first trend, logic , is closely related to the vulgar psychological interpretation; it is the most ancient, but nevertheless in part it has been preserved until recently. The theory of associationit arose out of the philosophical empiricism of the last century. These two tendencies are contrary to each other, logical theory wanting to bring the complexities of psychic phenomena back to higher forms of intellectual processes, and associations instead to lower or, as we say today, simple forms. But both of them fail equally due to their one-sidedness; not only because neither one nor the other succeeds with its own principles in explaining the sentimental and volitional processes, but also because these principles cannot even fully interpret the intellectual processes.

[11]8. The union of the psychology of the internal sense with the intellectualistic conception has again led to a particular principle, which many times has been fatal for the way of conceiving psychological facts. It consists in the false intellectualistic substantialization [4] of representations . When we not only admit an analogy between the objects of the so-called internal sense and the objects of the external sense, but we also consider the former as images of the latter; we are induced to carry those properties, which natural science attributes to the objects of the external world, even to the immediate objects of the internal sense, that is, to representations. And therefore it is admitted, that representations, just like the external things to which we refer, are relatively persistent objects, which can vanish from consciousness and then enter it again. Representations must undoubtedly be perceived by us now stronger and clearer, now weaker and confused, according to whether or not the internal sense is strengthened by the external sense, and according to the attention we pay to them;

9. Voluntary psychology is in this whole order of facts in full antithesis with intellectualism. While this is forced to admit an internal sense with special objects of internal perception, that is related to the view, that the internal experience is identified with the immediate experience. And since the content of psychological experience consists according to this conception, not of a sum of objects, which are given to the subject, but of everything that makes up the process of experience, that is, of the acts of the subject himself taken in their immediate property, which it has not been changed by any abstraction and reflection; the content of psychological experience is necessarily regarded as a connection of processes .

This concept of the process excludes the substantial and yet also more or less persistent nature of the psychic data of the experience. Psychic facts are events and not things; they flow like all events in time and are never at a given moment the same as in the preceding moment. In this sense the processes of the will have a typical value , very important for the intelligence of all the other psychic processes. Voluntary psychology does not at all affirm that willing is the only really existing form of the psychic process, but it only affirms that [12]the will, with the feelings and emotions closely connected to it, constitutes a part of the psychic experience, just as necessary as the sensations and the representations; moreover, he affirms that every other psychic process must be interpreted on the analogy of the volitional process; that is, as a fact that always changes over time, and not as a sum of persistent objects, as mostly intellectualism admits, as a consequence of the false reference that it makes of the properties placed by us in external objects, to the representations of the objects themselves . When you recognize the immediate reality of psychological experience, the study of deriving certain parts of the psychic process from others which specifically differ from it, is certainly excluded; likewise the attempts of metaphysical psychology to bring the internal experience back to imaginary processes different from it of a hypothetical metaphysical substratum, are in contradiction with the real real task of psychology. This task, since it refers to immediate experience, is connected from the beginning with the presupposition that every psychic datum of experience contains at the same time objective and subjective factors; these must always be considered as distinct from an arbitrary abstraction and not as really different processes. In fact, observation teaches us that there are no representations,

10. The guiding principles of the fundamental psychological conception, which we must subsequently keep fixed, can be summarized in the following three propositions:

1. Internal or psychological experience is no special domain of experience other than the others, but it is truly immediate experience .

2. This immediate experience is not a quiescent content, but a connection of processes ; it does not consist of objects, but of processes, that is, of general facts that take place in us and of their reciprocal relations established by laws.

3. Each of these processes has on the one hand an objective content and on the other a subjective process, and yet in this way it embodies the general conditions of all knowledge as well as of all practical human activity.

To these three propositions corresponds a triple position of psychology in relation to the other fields of knowledge:

[13]
1. As a science of immediate experience, it - as opposed to natural sciences , which, because of the abstraction they make of the subject, have as their object only the objective and mediated content of experience - it is the empirical science that reintegrates those . Every single fact of experience can be intimately evaluated in its full meaning only when it has withstood the test of natural or psychological analysis. In this sense, physics and physiology are also subsidiary sciences of psychology, as this in turn is an auxiliary discipline for natural research.

2. As a science of the most general forms of immediate human experience and of their connection according to laws, it is the foundation of the sciences of the spirit . In fact, the content of these sciences lies above all in the actions that arise from the immediate facts of human psychic life and in their effects. Psychology, insofar as it has as its task the study of the forms under which these actions occur and of the laws to which they are subject, is the most general, and at the same time, the basis of all the sciences of the spirit: of philology, history, 'political economy, jurisprudence, etc.

3. Since psychology equally considers the two fundamental conditions, which are the basis of theoretical knowledge as well as of practical operation, the subjective and the objective, and seeks to determine them in their reciprocal relationship; among all the empirical disciplines it is the one, the results of which are most closely suited to the study of the problem of knowledge as well as of ethics, the two fundamental questions of philosophy. Psychology, which with respect to natural science is the reintegrating science, with respect to the sciences of the spirit the fundamental, is the empirical science of preparation with respect to philosophy .

10 a. Although in the new psychology it is increasingly recognized that not so much the difference of the objects of experience as that of the point of view of the treatment of experience is what makes psychology different from natural science; yet the clear knowledge of the real particularities of that point of view, which fixes the scientific task for psychology, is still always prejudiced by the reflections of the tendencies of the old metaphysics and naturalistic philosophy. Instead of recognizing that the treatment of experience for the natural sciences is carried out on the basis of the abstraction of those subjective factors which enter into that experience, natural science is still always assigned the task of fixing the content of each experience. Place this, psychology would no longer be a coordinated discipline but subordinated to natural science. It should no longer eliminate that abstraction made by natural science [14]and with this come to a complete understanding of the experience; but it should take advantage of the concept of the "subject" highlighted by natural science to explain the influence of this subject on the data of our consciousness. Instead of recognizing that a sufficient definition of the subject is only possible on the basis of psychological research (¬ß 1, 3¬∫), here suddenly a concept of the subject already well formed and definitively based on natural science is introduced into psychology. Now for this the subject is identical to the bodily individual. Consequently, psychology is defined as the science which has the function of establishing the dependence of the immediate content of the experience on the bodily individual. This point of view, also called "psycho-physical materialism", it is unsustainable on the side of the theory of knowledge and psychologically unsuccessful. Since natural science purposely abstracts from the perceiving subject, even though it is contained in every experience, it is beyond doubt that it is hardly able to give a valid and ultimate determination of the subject. A psychology that starts from such a purely physiological definition no longer hinges on experience but, just like the old materialistic psychology, on a metaphysical premise. Moreover, this point of view is psychologically unsuccessful, because it assigns the causal interpretation of psychic processes to physiology, which can neither now nor ever give such an interpretation because of the different way of treating natural science and psychology. Finally, it is certainly clear that such a psychology,
