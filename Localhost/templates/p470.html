E. Geibel after François Coppee.
BBravo ! Bravo! There capo!

A truly frenetic applause roared and roared through the vast spaces of the opera house to X., almost drowning out the wild, diabolical sounds of the orchestra, which played in a strange, original way.

It was the first performance of the new opera by an unknown and unnamed composer, a fantastic opera called Satanella, the libretto of which introduced the audience to one of those enigmatic "she-devils" of olden times, who had come up from her subterranean realm to invoke through to ensnare a "minne singer" with her beauty and drive her to his death. Picked up by the angry people, she is dragged to the pyre as a witch and tied to the stake. The woodpile is kindled to the sound of a magnificent chorus, and smoke and flames rise up to wipe out the she-devil from the earth. Suddenly the flames parted, Satanella laughingly shakes the chains from her hands, the gray shroud of penance and death falls from her shoulders, and she herself stands in front dressed in the splendor of hell the shocked people. In wild dithyrambs she sings her enchanting magic song, and with the jubilant conclusion: "Farewell, I'll return to you as long as beauty celebrates victories, as long as men's hearts still allow themselves to be beguiled and deceived -" Satanella sinks down into her devouring earth.

The audience cheered at this ending and could not get enough of the powerful, sweet and metallic voice of the foreign singer who had come especially to sing "Satanella" and could not get enough of the wonderfully picturesque final tableau with the burning pyres, the medieval walls of the city with their towers and bay windows, the terrified crowd crowding together and the figure of Satanella on the pile of wood.

And she was marvelously beautiful indeed, that strange prima donna, Señora Dolores Falconieros—a slender, lithe figure, with the lustrous red hair of Titian falling in luxuriant waves on the scarlet silk robe that encircled her. And in the bloodless and yet life-fresh face burned large, radiant, velvet-black eyes, whose brilliance was enhanced by the dark brows closing over the fine Roman nose, by the long, silky eyelashes.

And as she stood there on the stage in the midst of the red-hot fire, in a red robe and red hair, in which a two-pronged diamond diadem flashed and sparkled, with the wonderfully captivating voice singing her devilish song moving in a strange rhythm and to it wielding a flaming sceptre, the shower of fire from which flew down into the stalls, she presented an image that, with easy-to-understand, demonic power, kindled the crowded audience to that frenetic applause that prompted again and again the "Satanella," from the depths of Hell, to climb up the sinkings, and to brandish their charred scepter with a grateful smile in salute.

The fate of the new opera was decided. The famous blond tenor as the "minne singer-hero" and the stranger who was discovered by the artistic director and immediately became famous breathed life into the wonderful music and consecrated it to go out into the whole world.

About an hour later, a small but select circle had gathered in the artistically furnished salon of the director of the Academy of Arts, Professor Balthasar. The master of the house, a brilliant painter in the prime of life who was known beyond the borders of Europe, loved to gather a circle around him after the theater, in which he and his amiable wife did the honors and went out of their way to entertain their guests physically and intellectually best cares.

Around the round table, whose silver tea set was handled silently and skillfully by Frau Balthasar, sat about six to eight people, including the head of the house and the housewife. There was the highly famous, brilliant history painter Richard Keppler, the sensitive poet N., the famous actress Luise R., the Legation Councilor Baron von Falkner. One seat was still empty - he was waiting for a late guest.

"The melody of the devil's song is still buzzing in my head - I can't get rid of it," said Professor Balthasar.

"That's what the demonic influence of this music does - it's a real, genuine work of the devil," exclaimed the actress.

"Yes, but the work of a brilliant devil," replied Keppler.

"That's the right word for it," said the Legation Counselor, a tall, commanding figure with dark eyes and hair and the same full beard, "Satanella is a work that lets a fountain of genius gush out of every bar, but one Brilliance, which I would like to call heartless, because it doesn't touch and stimulate the heart, only the mind. The composer is a genius, there is no doubt about that, but he is not a genius by God's grace, but by Lucifer's.«

"And yet knows how to strike such warm heart tones," Frau Balthasar accepted from the unknown master, "I only remind you of the troubadour's sweet love song in the second act."

"Oh yes, it flatters the ear, but not the heart," replied Falkner coldly, "it charms, but it does not move."

"Well, then I declare myself satisfied with the magic that the love song contains," cried Keppler, "why shouldn't we poor mortals let ourselves be charmed for once? We're only lucky if our hearts don't suffer in the process."

"You may be right, Keppler," said the Legation Counselor calmly, "everyone's individuality is so different. For me, music isn't music if it only dazzles and intoxicates. So I openly declare, at the risk of being taken for a vandal, that for me the majority of ancient statues are nothing but old blocks of marble whose stupid eyes stare at us imitators quite stupidly, and that the most beautiful face from which no heart speaks, leaves me terribly indifferent. Such is the music of ›Satanella‹. I admire the electric current of genius that pulses through her beats, but I don't love her because a warm, human heartbeat doesn't tremble through her.«

While the legation counselor was speaking, one of the portieres had parted and appeared in her pleated frame, noticed only by Frau Balthasar, a dark female figure with red Titian hair - Dolores Falconieros. Smiling, she put her finger to her lips to show that she wanted to remain unnoticed, and she was still standing when Professor Balthasar replied:

"Well, well, but what the music lacks, the performers gave it!"

"How wonderfully beautiful our heroic tenor sang the minstrel, how soulful," cried the actress.

"And how wonderful was the Falconieros in the title role," added Keppler, "it was an incomparable performance."

"Certainly, incomparable in the portrayal of the most cruel heartlessness," said Falkner mockingly, "it was as if this Satanella was playing her very own self - this stranger cannot strike a warm heartbeat, precisely because she cannot, because she too is only quite a genius is. I don't like these heartless women.«

"But the falconieros -" began the poet, who until then had only been listening -

»The Falconieros, as she calls herself with her nom de guerre , could have composed and written the ›Satanella‹,« Falkner completed briefly and coolly.

Frau Marianne Balthasar had been listening to the conversation with growing unease and now quickly pushed the tea set aside.

"Ah - the Señora!" she cried, ending the embarrassing scene and walking towards the singer who was still standing in the doorway. The rest rose and bowed as their names were introduced, and Donna Dolores took the empty chair between the Professor and Keppler - Falkner sat opposite her.

"Above all, excuse me for being so late," she said, with a charming smile that enhanced her beautiful features, "but I had to change clothes first——"

"Take off the Satanella and put on the garb of ordinary mortals," joked the professor.

"As if I could ever get rid of this satanic color!" she replied, stroking it with her slender white hand her now pinned up hair. Her gaze strayed across the table and met that of the Legation Council.

"How can you talk like that, señora," said Keppler, looking at the singer with a delighted artist's gaze, "or shouldn't you really know what precious jewelry you wear on your head?"

"My hair," she laughed. 'Oh, that's an artist's whim. Ordinary mortals call it red.”

"I didn't know that our Germanic blond is also common in Spain," remarked Frau Balthasar.

"Oh, I'm half German," replied Donna Dolores, in her pure yet alien dialect, "and I consider Germany my homeland, though the sun is less scorching here than in Brazil."

"Oh yes, much cooler," said Professor Balthasar, shivering. “We northerners are our own people – we only feel good when the ice rises to our hearts. The southern fire that burns through others repels us when it touches us."

"Yes, if it sprays poison and dagger, vendetta and lava," interjected Falkner.

Again he caught a glimpse of the singer's dark eyes, and again he had to reluctantly admit that offstage those eyes had a very different expression, a free, proud and yet soft expression.

The tea was finished, and the little circle rose to either go to the book-laden tables or leafing through one of those portfolios that stood in large racks against the wall and contained valuable sketches and engravings.

Donna Dolores sat down in an armchair and leafed through one of these portfolios, smiling as she listened to Keppler, who asked for the privilege of painting her as "Satanella."

'Because,' he said, 'I'm dying to solve the problem of color that you, Donna Falconieros, conjured up for us tonight. That wonderful, delicious effect of red on red - I had never dreamed of such boldness. And, most importantly, it was aesthetic.”

"My boldness is completed by your saying," replied Donna Dolores, "for, frankly, I was almost trembling when I put on the scarlet dress in the dressing-room to-night, and let my hair down. And when the red flames were kindled and blazed around me, I thought I had been sentenced to damnation, to being excluded from the artist's guild.«

"It was a magnificent sight, this last scene of 'Satanella,'" cried Keppler, "a scene such as the painter's eye longs to see. Red on red - flames and gold - I can't shake the thought of it just yet and I'm not likely to rest until I have the colors on my palette."

Dolores agreed to give the painter a few sessions, going on to examine the contents of the portfolio scrutinize. Suddenly she uttered a soft cry and paled as she looked at a color sketch, a small landscape with magnificent, dark old oaks and elms, between which protruded an old house built in a square with porticos all around, the four corners flanked by as many tall, oriel-covered, ivy-covered towers. On one of them a green and white checkered flag waved, indicating that this old gray house was not a monastery, as it first appeared.

Donna Dolores stared at this sketch for a long time – her pale cheeks had turned even paler and she seemed afraid to speak. Keppler looked over her shoulder at the paper.

"Ah, this is the Falcon Court," said he. 'It's a picturesque spot, isn't it. And Legation Counselor von Falkner is the happy heir of the same.«

"So-?" said Donna Dolores, with a peculiar expression, looking over at the named, who was engaged in an animated conversation with the professor. His ruthless words about her and her performance on stage, which she overheard earlier, hadn't affected her as deeply as one might have thought, but they had left a small wound. From that moment, however, when she looked across at the heir to the falconry and his gaze flew over her again, cold, almost contemptuous, she knew that this man was her enemy, or had to become it.

"A little Eden, this falconry," said Keppler, pointing to the picture, "and yet again the background for a fight from the time of the iconoclasts. Balthazar created one of his most famous pictures from this sketch, which he took on the spot with the permission of the present gentlemen. It was on this occasion that he made the acquaintance of Falkner.”

"Of the heirs of the Falcon Court," repeated Dolores softly, as if to herself.

"A man of intellect and knowledge," Keppler also added softly, "but sometimes dismissive and cold to the point of being ruthless. Balthasar is pretty much the only artist whose salon he visits—”

"So he's exclusive and arrogant, then," Dolores interrupted the painter.

"One is sometimes tempted to call it that," said the latter, shrugging his shoulders. "Falkner does love art and unreservedly recognizes genius, but he may know little or nothing about artists."

"Haughty, then," interjected Dolores.

“Perhaps, senora. But at least he doesn't avoid artists, while he has an outspoken dislike for—”

Keppler faltered.

"Well?" asked the singer calmly, "why don't you complete it: while he has a pronounced dislike for women artists."

"Señora -" said the painter, half laughing, half embarrassed.

"Why not say what the person in question is sporting?" she said, shrugging slightly, laying the sketch down. But as she did so, a deep breath escaped her chest almost like a sigh.

She rose and took her gloves.

"What, you want to go already, señora?" called the professor and hurried towards her.

"It's late and I'm tired," she replied kindly. “The part of today's opera was exhausting. It's not that easy to play a 'devil'," she added with a smile, almost mischievously.

"O señora, sing us another song, just a little song," asked Mrs. Balthasar and led Dolores to the open grand piano.

Donna Dolores hesitated for a moment, then sat down at the instrument and ran her hands over the keys in a prelude. And she sang a simple little song, short as an interlude.

The rose complained
That her scent will fade away too quickly,
Which Lenz gave her.
So I told her to comfort her
that he may blow through my songs
And have an eternal life there.
And how she sang it! Was that sweet, enchanting soft voice the same one that hailed the she-devil song from the stage before? Word and sound moved through the silent room like a promise.

And the small circle listened breathlessly when Dolores had finished and softly played the epilogue. As she did so, her gaze wandered to where the sketch of the falconry lay on the folder, and there was a wet shimmer in her eyes. In soft minor chords she dissolved the melody of Mirza Schaffy's song and passed into another -

From youth, from youth
A song always sounds to me –
she sang softly as in a dream. Heartbreakingly, the tones of the simple folk song swelled, and through the simple words it sounded like a sob—

O you homeland, o you homeland,
Let to your sacred space
Just me again, just me again
Escape in a dream.
No swallow brings, no swallow brings
give you back what you cry for;
And the swallow sings, and the swallow sings
In the village like before.The sweet voice faded away and the singer dropped her hands from the keys. Opposite her stood Alfred von Falkner, his eyes fixed on the stranger whom he had condemned so harshly earlier. And the song -? It rose in his mind's eye like a blurry memory as the song played. Hadn't this song once been heard in the cloisters of the Falkenhof by a fresh, bright child's voice -? He stroked his high forehead with his hand and thought and thought - and he almost felt as if he had to look for the form of a playmate in the happy days of his youth, in the narrow confines of boyhood - yes, then he felt as if he were listening he a short, bright, mocking laugh –


And the swallow sings, and the swallow sings
In the village like before –
Donna Dolores sang the final words of her song there at the piano - and all at once the pale, forgotten figures were lost - melted into a nothingness from which they arose.

"That's what I call music," Balthasar exclaimed after a pause and approached the singer, "it trembled through the most secret fibers of the soul, because it was sung with the heart!"

Donna Dolores sat up and straightened with a sigh of relief. Then she gave a short, bright, mocking laugh that made Falkner wince, because the laugh sounded so familiar to him - and a dark flash from her beautiful eyes flitted to her opposite.

"With my heart?" she repeated loudly and clearly, "You're wrong, professor. I played my very own self in the 'Satanella' today - I can't strike a warm heart tone, precisely because I have no heart - -"

Falkner frowned as the singer repeated his own words to him like a mockingbird – then he shrugged, contemptuously, haughtily.

Then the black eyes sprayed him with a real devil's look - it almost seemed as if a red fire emanated from this look - again the fine, pale red mouth laughed that strange, mind-confusing laugh.

"You are a good psychologist and physiologist, Herr von Falkner," Donna Dolores called to him - they were the first words she addressed to him, "your fine feeling didn't cheat you - I composed ›Satanella‹ myself!«

There was a general "Ah" of surprise, and Falkner bit his lip—suddenly annoyed at his judgment, annoyed that he was right. Donna Dolores, however, let her hands slide again over the keys of the grand piano, wildly, whirling, the rustling chords sounded with which the people in the "Satanella" ignited the woodpile to burn the witch, who now suddenly turned into the never eternally living evil principle to be exterminated, transformed into the curse that has rested on the world since its beginning. The chords swelled mightily, and the singer's voice began mightily:

Farewell as long as the sun shines
Transfigured woman's eternal power,
As long as passions still glow,
As long as beauty laughs alluringly,
As long as men's hearts break
betrayed by a false woman
So long, so often I return,
I will always remain in your midst!
Kindles the flame red embers,
You won't take me out of this world
For where man's arrogance boasts,
My scepter bears a rich harvest.
I live in every woman's heart
I bend every man's power
I am the snake of paradise
I cause mischief - so watch out!
She closed with a whooshing chord that sounded like the crackling of flames, and then sprang up.

'It's time to rest - good night!' she cried, and was gone before the others knew it.

Downstairs in front of the door stood the singer's light coupe, the horses had been stamping with impatience for a long time, and when Dolores had got on, they carried their light load at a brisk trot to the hotel where the "Brazilian lady" lived, and where her black maid and Duenna in one person, the Herculean old negress who had already prepared everything to rest.

"Tereza," said Dolores in Spanish, when the negress braided her hair for the night, "Tereza, who do you think I saw today? The 'Erben von Falkenhof'.«

'All the saints - the Alfred? Did he recognize you, mistress?”

'Oh no - and I didn't tell him a word about it. He has grown into a handsome, tall man, haughty and dismissively serious.”

"Like all the falcons," grumbled old Tereza. 'Well, let him go. You don't need him, nor the old man with his crutches clattering."

"No, I don't need it," said Donna Dolores, "but," she added, her lips twitching, "but I'd like to see the Falcon Court again."

"So buy the old stone nest from them, mistress!" advised Tereza.

"I can't," said Dolores musingly, "it's a fief -"

"What's this?"

"It's - oh Tereza, I'm tired and I want to sleep."

She sank into the soft pillows and closed her eyes.

"The heir to the Falcon Court!" she murmured as she fell asleep.

***

Professor Balthasar broke up soon after Donna Dolores left.

"I am pleased," Keppler had said after she had gone, "I am pleased that she has just composed Satanella, and that she confessed it, Baron Falkner, in spite of your sharp remarks, which she must have heard."

"That only confirms my words," replied the Counsellor, grasping his hat.

"Well, I don't want to admit that so easily," said Balthasar thoughtfully, "just the fact that she confirmed the harsh sentence she had heard with her confession proves that she has nothing to shy away from."

Falconer shrugged.

'This is where we differ, Professor. The boldness of the falconieros dazzles you as their genius dazzles the crowd. I hate this loud confession of my own heartlessness more than I can express.”

"Stop, don't take too much credit for this little devilry of the Señora," said Keppler, laughing, "you teased her!"

"How could I know she was listening?" Falkner replied coldly. "Besides, it couldn't hurt her to hear the truth."

"That is, your view, Baron," Keppler replied with emphasis. "Or do you want to hold on to your claim that Donna Dolores has no heart, now that we've heard her sing so beautifully poignantly?"

An almost hostile look from Falkner's eyes grazed the painter.

'You are an artist yourself, Herr Keppler,' he said coldly, 'after all you should know how to create an effect. I am sorry if my skepticism does not agree with your views, but I find it impossible to believe in the truth of the beautifully expressed feelings of a professional singer.«

"So that's your catchphrase?" A faint blush spread across the painter's witty face. »A singer by profession! Of course you only think of it as a being who makes as much capital as possible from her voice, and like the cobbler working off his bad luck wire, every evening her singing part? I do not envy you this knowledge, Baron Falkner, and I am glad that I have remained naïve enough to believe in the sanctity of true artistry.«

" Chacun à son gout ," replied Falkner lightly, "I confess that I lack such a strong belief, even if I want to concede that in earlier times there were artists who worked for the sake of art."

"In any case, the basic idea of ​​'Satanella' is a deeply thought-out one," the professor interjected into the conversation.

"To my taste too well thought out for a young lady like this German Brazilian," Falkner interrupted him, not without scorn.

'Well, well - for once she only made the music and not the words, and then I abstract from the person and I would like to give the work the recognition it deserves,” cried Balthasar, becoming more animated.

"And I cannot separate the person from the work, since he is linked to it by his individualism."

"Oh you barbarian," cried Frau Balthasar, laughing as she stepped between the gentlemen whose dialogue she found too pointed, "how can you be so harsh? But we will forgive you if you will admit that Señora Falconieros is an exceptionally gifted, outstanding woman.”

Falconer bowed.

"I'll admit that," he said, "but I lack understanding and taste for such 'unusual and outstanding women' which, thank God, are not common in our circles."

Another bow, and Falkner left the small circle.

"Those are outrageous views," Frau Balthasar burst out. "I don't understand how a man of the Baron's intellectual stature can be so narrow-minded."

"Dear Marianne, it may be very difficult to work your way out of the tightly bound changing pads of certain prejudices , " replied the professor coolly. 'We too may have our prejudices without knowing it, and we too may, out of stubbornness and innate dogmatism, go further than we previously intended in defending the views we hold. Besides, no man can resist his antipathies.”

"Falkner's remarks about Dolores suggest more than mere antipathy."

"That's no reason why the two shouldn't make fabulous love again," Balthasar said humorously.

"Nonsense."

"What do you want? What did Juliet say when she very quickly made the acquaintance of her Romeo?

Such great love burned out of great hate!
I saw too soon I recognized too late.
O marvel! I feel driven
To love the worst enemy most tenderly.”
Mrs. Marianne laughed.

"You only forget, dear man, that neither Baron Falkner has what it takes to be a Romeo, nor will Donna Dolores, our Satanella, turn into a languishing Juliet."

"Why not?" said Keppler, bidding the couple "good night," "nature plays wonderfully, and in the end every woman has as much of a Juliet as every man has of a Romeo."

In the meantime Falkner had reached his apartment, but he still couldn't find peace. He went to the window, opened it and let the cold night air stream into the room, because although winter was drawing to a close and the first heralds of spring were already being sold on the streets in the form of tiny bouquets of violets and snowdrops, winter was still in control not yet broken, and yet he sometimes sensitively showed his power.

Falkner was agitated, and that he was so annoyed him for cause's sake.

"To a singer," he murmured scornfully, and yet he could not get rid of the image of that singer - it jiggled before his eyes and blinded him.

"I hate red hair," he said to himself, his imagination bathing Satanella's masses of golden hair in that fuchsia hue that, together with watery eyes and mottled complexion, is so repulsive.

"You'll look like this in daylight," he said to himself, "and the dark brows and lashes will show the traces of color -"

But the eyes! No, coloring them was an impossibility.

"Beware of those whose hair color contrasts with that of their eyes," he said to himself, and at the same time had to smile at the unearthed nursemaid's wisdom. And in the end, what did the "Brazilian" matter to him, who perhaps went by the rare name Jette Müller or Gustel Schulze in her private life. The thought of it made him laugh.

'Donna Dolores Falconieros,' he said with pathetic mockery, 'I'll avoid you. Luckily I have nothing to do with you and I probably won't. Our paths lead very far apart.«

With this decision, Alfred von Falkner thought the matter was settled. But then he remembered the song:

From youth, from youth
A song always sounds to me –
