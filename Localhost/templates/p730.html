"You destroy them too kindly, Maurice, for me to defend them." »

We continued to talk like this. We talked about Cigogne, his wife, the Michels, their kid, the pines, the olive trees, the waves, the rocks, the great races we could undertake soon, half on foot, half in a cart, then, as if As usual, we began to talk about the future, about the future of each of us, about this little piece of the future that we allow ourselves to be fully unveiled.

“And you, what will you do, Serval? »

I tell him, as far as I could foresee.

“And you, Mahoudiaux?

"I'm thinking of returning to service in six months, but how, I don't know, with this stupid ankylosis...

"And our friends?"

— The Maxences will continue… they will continue: Roger to be mad, to create a world for himself by believing that he touches him, Lucienne to suffer, to hide from it, to love her husband, to pity him. Likewise, the Michels will continue to form a happy couple, except in the event that Victor receives a bullet in the head… but if that happens… ah! Serval, please, let's talk about something else! talk to me about painting!…”

So I described to him this large composition which I had sketched and which I was thinking of resuming, where, on a green meadow, a magician presented a crystal to people squatting around her...

"With a little sketch, I'll put it in place for you, Mahoudiaux. »

But, suddenly… We looked at each other first, before looking up at the first-floor window from which came the horrible, heart-rending, prolonged, high-pitched cry that pierced the air.

"That's Lucienne!" said Mahoudiaux.

There was no end to this woman's cry. One cries like this to save oneself, to escape, when there is no longer any hope, and then a hoarse gasp interrupts him.

Then there were words. It was perhaps less dreadful, because it was more explicit.

" Help ! come ! come ! for God's sake ! he cut his throat! »

He had indeed cut his throat with a razor, rather clumsily. The bed he lay on looked filthy. Dirty laundry is always ugly...

"Serval, telephone No. 8 ," said Mahoudiaux. Doctor Famin must be at home. With his bicycle, he will be here in five minutes: he has only to go down the hill. »

And Maurice did his best to stop the flow of blood. The maid was nursing Lucienne, who had fainted in front of the window.

The Michels arrived a few moments later. The kid was immediately sent to lunch in the kitchen. His parents helped us a great deal by their activity and the example of their coolness.

"Why?... So he was unhappy?" asked Victor Michel simply.

The expected doctor appeared soon after, on his bicycle. The hour that followed remains vague in my memory, full of small, useful, precise gestures, ordered by this good, very knowledgeable man.

“It's not to say, declared Doctor Famin, but I guarantee you, Mr. Maurice, that his hand trembled at just the right moment. He was lucky… Now he's safe. The poor ! he was going with cash, and then he must have thought that life wasn't so bad, all the same… and he slowed down. No, lady, your husband is saved. Don't cry, I assure you: there is no need to make yourself sick! Lets go ! lets go ! a bit of peace! Men are always crazy. Believe me, Madame, he will recover. »

Cigogne had opened his eyes and was staring straight ahead with an air of astonishment.

CHAPTER LIV
From the lavender notebook.

I haven't opened this notebook for a month and a half; I will never open it again. Why do it, since he is no longer mine? The horrible adventure we had just lived upset me so much that I had not written anything down. It was enough for me to cry, thanking Heaven that Roger was still alive. I forgot the existence of this notebook so well that I left it lying around!

Roger recovered fairly quickly; he started talking again, getting up, telling us about his plans. The slight fever from which he suffered each evening, and which gave him bad nights, subsided little by little; Doctor Famin stopped coming to La Cassolette. We were starting to breathe again. M. Serval, who intended to leave, had promised to stay again and I was grateful to him for it: his easy and sensible conversation distracted us from the drama...

And then, the day before yesterday, on returning from a walk by the sea, I find, here, in the small living room, Roger in tears, his head in his hands, and my lavender notebook open in front of him, on the table. ! He had been reading for an hour. He had read it all!

First, I blushed… oh! as if they were undressing me in the street! I was shaking, I think my teeth were chattering, feeling gripped, perhaps for the first time in my life, by what is called real anger. Immediately, Roger gave himself up to a horrible fit of despair and, however, my anger quickly changed into utter indifference. No pity… no, I did say complete indifference. What my husband might express or think, the anguish that plagued his face, his pleading gaze, his gestures, his phrases, all that no longer interested me, I didn't care. At that moment, I remembered an opinion of Mahoudiaux which seemed paradoxical to me, a few days ago... he said:

“You see, Lucienne, a mediocre book can, if need be, be read again. We continue to add our own emotion to it; a mediocre comedy or drama is boring from the second hearing: you no longer allow yourself to be impressed and, sometimes, you get angry. »

I understand a little…

Roger called himself miserable, he begged my forgiveness, but if he apologized with so much passion, it was not for having read my lavender notebook, oh! not at all ! it was for having made me suffer so much. He doesn't know me very well! To suffer through him, I was beginning to get used to it, but this is worse. Often, an insult breaks the heart more than a sentence, and we show less patience… and we are right. Besides, men do not act otherwise: they endure the most frightful miseries without protesting; they revolt for a slap.

My pardon, he got it very quickly. Sincere ? I don't know: as complete as I could give it, and nevertheless, I discover, deep inside me, like an old deposit of resentment... In short, would he have guessed correctly? Isn't it just his nasty action the day before yesterday that troubles me so much? There would remain a residue of past sorrows?… So, him, I would love him less?

Tonight, I must be honest with myself, as one is when confessing... Yes, but one point remains perfectly clear: my lavender notebook has become anyone's notebook, since Roger l 'opened !

When I was a young girl, I wrote a few lines every evening in smaller, pink-lined notebooks. I burned them, before my first marriage, out of a feeling of shame: they contained too much nonsense!

Later I wrote in green notebooks and burned them too, the day before my wedding with Roger, so that he would never know how much I had suffered before meeting him, but soon I resumed this old habit and , in my lavender notebook, I said all my happiness.

I thought, “Someday I'll show him this; he will guess what I cannot explain to him, he will see me as I am, he will feel how I love him. »

Poor Lucienne was still naive!

I did not make Roger read these pages… He read them.

Yesterday, I was planning to burn my notebook, since everything I write seems doomed to the flames, but I made another, more reasonable decision: I keep it, out of caution. I don't want to be taken back, I don't want to suffer anymore. This document, I will read it sometimes. It will save me from making new mistakes, especially the one that consists in allowing myself to be softened by arranged speeches, gestures, facial expressions. It may be that a part of sincerity remains there, but no matter! I don't want to suffer anymore.

I said it: nothing that touches him no longer interests me. When he swore to me that he would immediately resume serious occupations, that he had already had several chemistry books sent to him, that, to distract himself, he would resume his photography work, instead of tiring himself out reading, I wanted to answer, with a friendly and calm air: “Very well, very well; that is very wise! as I would have answered M. Serval or Maurice Mahoudiaux.

No, I don't want to be moved anymore, I don't want to suffer anymore and I'll never write a line in this notebook again.

CHAPTER LV
It is the beginning of autumn: a beautiful evening. We are gathered on the terrace, Lucienne, Mahoudiaux and me; we watch the night come. Not a breath, but the scents of summer are still suspended in the warm air. We breathe them in, we penetrate them.

We'll be here an hour, I think. Cigogne has already gone up to bed. This gives us some peace of mind. I find it hard to bear his shameful invalid talk; however, he is well cured of his razor stroke (clumsy, if you will). I'm going back to Paris the day after tomorrow! At least, allow me to fully enjoy the calm of this end of stay at La Cassolette. Ah! What a beautiful weather this evening!

Our poor friend Lucienne was very shaken by her husband's latest madness (otherwise perhaps I was not expecting it). He passed the mark this time. She seems to realize it, like the child whose foolishness one forgives for a while, but to whom one day one says: "And now, that's enough!" She is, moreover, very kind to Cigogne, eager to take care of him when necessary; she reads to him, she talks to him without the slightest trace of resentment or fatigue, and yet it's not the same thing any more: you can feel it.

This evening, as usual, Maurice is smoking his pipe; me, I breathe… the perfumes of the air are enough for me; Lucienne no longer sees to finish her knitting, she put it on her knees, she breathes too.

We chat or, rather, we exchange sentences.

"You shouldn't be too severe either, Lucienne," said Mahoudiaux.

“Be more clear, my friend.

'You shouldn't be too cruel with this boy: he has excuses.

'I know it, Maurice, but I can't take it anymore! I still have friendship for him, a certain tenderness, a lot of pity… what's missing, what I no longer find in myself, is the stupid generosity that great love gives: he's lied too often!

“Lucienne, you are mistaken. The day before yesterday Roger behaved like a boor, I agree, but not one day he stopped being sincere...

"Come on, Maurice!

- In his way.

- Please, do not joke, Maurice: I suffer! speak seriously… and you, Monsieur Serval, what do you think of Roger, from this point of view?

- Madame, I replied, on second thought, I would rather agree with our friend Maurice. You cannot judge sincerity or lies, because you are naturally truthful. It's not just that way. Some people lie without almost knowing it, without even knowing it at all: they transmit what their slightly crazy imagination presents to them; the pace, the tone, the conviction, the grace are added to it and embellish the speech; their talent, sometimes their genius, imposes us so much that we never cease to be in adoration in front of them. Still others don't have this quality, or lose it, or simply turn to someone in the know who doesn't like them anymore… so it turns out that they lied! No ! I assure you ! They only lied less well, or in front of a bad audience.

"Does that excuse Roger for having made me suffer so much, for having misunderstood me so much?"

'Lucienne,' interrupted Mahoudiaux in an almost harsh voice, 'did you yourself understand that from the first day?

- Oh ! shut up, my friend! I loved him so much!

- To understand, is it a good way?

"I had such great confidence in him!" I waited so impatiently for him to do what he wanted to do, what he could do! and each time he did nothing, he extricated himself from the difficulty with a new lie.

"It's simply, Lucienne, that you imagined a pretty, well-fitted Roger who, however, did not resemble the Roger of that day," said Mahoudiaux.

- I saw him, I added, so many different reflections! I have listened to him in so many roles!…

- Roles! roles! that's it ! I never said anything else. The sincerity of an actor!

- Why not ?

Mahoudiaux had looked up from his pipe to ask this question, which seemed to offend Lucienne." Have fun ! joke again! she said, you will never be anything but men! Me, I was sincere in another way and I'm going to prove it to you… Here… (in fact, I don't mind parting with it now…) You can form an opinion. »

She leaned over her workbox and pulled out a lavender-colored notebook:

'Here,' she went on, 'is what Roger was reading when I surprised him. Read in your turn, Maurice, read, Monsieur Serval… You often speak of the various reflections of your friend; you will find some other, quite singular ones in there. No, no, there is no indiscretion… an indiscretion? how then ! on the contrary, it will give me pleasure and will perhaps be able to distract you for a while.

"Lucienne," Mahoudiaux asked, "why are you so nervous?"

'Nervous? Oh! never mind ! I no longer watch myself… And you will see it there as it was, once upon a time.

- You mean, Lucienne, as it seemed to you once!

'He wasn't acting yet.

- Let's go! he always played it, but you liked his role.

'Madame,' I added, 'I too have liked his parts more than once; in some I even admired him, because he genuinely suffered while playing them.

"Monsieur Serval, do you do literature?"

— I wouldn't know, dear Madame, being a painter. I have often said this to your husband in response to the same reproach. »

She shrugged in exasperation.

“He would no doubt have succeeded as an actor, says Mahoudiaux, but that would have been a downfall. He wanted to reign, to love, to conquer, with his own strength, all alone, but, unable to live by himself, he first sought an example before acting. A quiet and gentle life bored him; he came out immediately; he missed his heroic life, always for the same reasons… He didn't even know how to kill himself, the poor fellow! and yet I bet he unconsciously went to great lengths to achieve his effect!

"It's you who are unjust," said Lucienne. Granted, I was only able to see images of him, but I loved Roger and, when he loved me, he was sincere... It's dreadful to think: would he have... would he have tried to kill himself because that I no longer loved him?

"Women have a truly admirable logic!" said Mahoudiaux.

"Who just closed a shutter up there?" I asked.

— It's the maid, whom I recommended to fold them all down and open the windows… As for my notebook, you will read it, of course. I apologize for my bad handwriting, but not at all for the sentiments I express. Besides, I won't express any more like it, I swear it to you.

"Why, ma'am?" I asked. Sounds like your life is over. Cigogne has just suffered a cruel ordeal and this time I am sure he will benefit from the lesson. He loves you with all his heart and you still love him…yes, yes, whatever you write or say, you still love him.

'Lucienne,' added Mahoudiaux, 'don't frown. You'll love it tomorrow...and life is sweet to live. »

We remained silent for a good quarter of an hour. The shadow surrounded us; a faint murmur could be heard in the distance in the branches; the foliage was shot through with a long sigh: the breeze was rising. My nightingale (the one who frequents the tree in the left corner of the terrace and announces its presence with a little amorous prelude) was not singing yet… We were waiting for its song.

Lucienne went on in a less cold and yet calmer voice:

“Will I love him tomorrow? it is possible, in short, and in any case, I will try. Now that you have scolded me, good evening, my friends; I take a little walk in the garden, then I go home. »

We also returned, Mahoudiaux and I.

In my room, I found a note in Cigogne's handwriting, neatly pinned to the middle of my pillow:

“Come to my house, right now. »

I went there.

A few moments later, leaning over the banister of the stairs, I called Mahoudiaux, between high and low, as calmly as possible:

“Maurice, go up to Cigogne. »CHAPTER LVI
“We will always have to call old Famin, says Mahoudiaux, but not to treat Roger, because Roger is dead. »

Of that, there was no doubt: Roger was indeed dead.

“Maurice… how awful! I exclaimed; What happened ? »

This body lying on the bed, this body so stiff, so truly dead, terrified me, with its pursed lips, its vacant stare, its thin bird profile pointing between the two hands laid flat on its cheeks.

"We'll see," said Mahoudiaux, "and this might tell us something." »

He took a sheet of paper covered in writing from the desk and read the first few lines.

" In effect… "

He also took a bottle, near the inkwell.

“Golden cyanide… Couldn't be better. »

He was saddened, our good Mahoudiaux, despite this affectation of great calm. The features of his face showed it clearly, and his voice, and his eyes. Once more he looked at the body, once more, touching it, he recognized a corpse, then he approached the electric lamp which lit the desk, and together we read the sheet largely scribbled with feverish lines.

“You can hear very well from this window what you are saying at the corner of the terrace. You speak quietly, but just listen. One of your words escapes me from time to time. It doesn't matter: the rest is so clear, with such a limpid meaning! However, I gave up savoring the end of the speech… I closed the shutters at the moment when they declared: “The poor fellow didn't even know how to kill himself! That was nice! totally nice! So I prepared, immediately, the little work that I did not intend to do until later in the night, perhaps at dawn. The photographic products that you will find on this desk (others are in my wardrobe), are intended to ensure the success of my business, of my final scene. (It is appropriate to use a theatrical term since I missed my vocation by not going up on the boards.

" Lets go ! farewell!... I will now take a note to Serval's room; when I get back, I will look, through the corridor window, at the sky and the little piece of sea that we discover, and the tops of the woods...

“Oh! I am back from it ! ah! it was so beautiful! but the nightingales were no longer singing. They did well: I might have lacked courage. They were silent: I did not know the nightingales were so charitable... Immerse myself in life again... ah! no !

"So I'm going to drink my potion: 'Golden Cyanide.' To say that I had to use photographic products to show myself to be completely sincere!… It will be essential to take a strong dose. It is not for nothing that I was once a chemist. Finally, I will go and lie down on my bed; I will wait a few more moments in this world… then I will pass to the other side.

“All in all, I like you, in spite of everything, but it's too late to start again, and besides, my foot is hurting me a lot, tonight. Farewell for good. I am wrong ? It's possible. Too bad… Farewell to all… Farewell.

“RM”

"Our friend should not see this paper," said Mahoudiaux in a faint voice.

He was folding it to put it in his pocket when Lucienne entered.

She guessed everything at first sight. She was livid.

" Dead ? she asked.

And his quick gesture plucked the funeral paper from Mahoudiaux's hand.

“Luciana!

'No, no, Maurice, I'll read it, I have the right to. »

Once again he shrugged.

Some orders were given to Emilie whom I went to wake up; We did what was necessary: ​​very little, then we had only to wait, and we stayed with the dead. The heat being strong enough, I threw open the shutters of the window and then the moon came in, bringing with it its madness, and the sweetness of the night air, and the song of the nightingales (for they had singing), and the scents of the woods, and the distant murmur of the breeze, and all that spoke of love and of quiet happiness and of the charming pleasure of living, while, on the bed, my friend Stork grew cold.
