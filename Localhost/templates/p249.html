FIRST ACT
Studio of Henri van Bergen. Back wall on the right door to staircase, left door to bedroom, in the middle old Dutch cupboard. Clothes hanger, etc. on the right wall, door to kitchen-junk room on the front. At the top right is a glass roof, on the right in the front a table with chairs, on the table a pot with brushes and painting utensils. Left wall mantelpiece with pot stove, etc. In the middle large carpet with sofa, on which cushions and cloths; small shed behind it over which scarves. Left front plan easel with a large canvas. On the right side of the canvas a semi-recumbent, almost completed nude figure can be distinguished, on the left a cursory pendant of it — in the middle a vague face, the three sections are separated by gray-black stripes as if for a triptych.

FIRST SCENIC
Henri, then Uncle.

Henri (about thirty, not tall, but of good stature, dark hair, clear, expressive eyes. He sits whistling at his easel with a pipe in his hand, judging the figure on the right). Good — good — , but it's not there yet! — no — — ( there is a knock ) yes!

Uncle (at sixty, short in stature, a white, jutting goatee; his slightly hoarse voice and his suspiciously red nose make him look a bit run down, but his squinting, watery myopic eyes have not lost their luster yet. He slides towards him with a grin. within). hmm! — good morning — good morning!

Henri ( standing up ). To-morrow, uncle, — will you come and have a look?

uncle. Hmm — exactly! I just wanted to come upstairs, huh?

Henri ( bowing ). Honored, honored!

Uncle ( comes and sits before the donkey ). I wanted to come and ask you — hm ( picking his goatee for the painting ) you're just painting now, you know — darling! ( he blinks his eyes to a spot and points with his finger, mockingly ) — and that?

Henry. Which - ? that is a hip, a French high hip, — beautiful, the light on a hip!

uncle. Exactly — but we painted it differently. In our time...

Henri ( provoked for a moment ). Oh yes, of course, that's what all the old gentlemen say; “in our time—in our time!” — but it's another time now!

uncle. Hmm, well — exactly, you think so, my boy — but time always goes in a circle ( drawing with his index finger in the air ) and before you know it, they'll get back on the back and you're on again." the end of the circle. Of course: we old people are worth nothing anymore — but that's exactly what we thought in our day! After all, the world is always exactly like that—! ( When Henri shakes his head emphatically ). Yes, you think: that uncle with his genre pieces, that doesn't mean anything anymore — but I sold one again in the past! ( Henri shrugs his head ). Precisely! ( threatening him with the finger ). Take care, young sir! ( turning back to the painting† Well — watch your French hips! In our time, that still meant something, didn't it — we were still learning to 'draw', you see.

Henry. Oh yes.

uncle. Precisely! — We — when we were young, we first learned to draw. But you — you really can't draw at all anymore — ( picking his goatee for the painting ) hmm, actually you can't paint at all either — hmm, actually you can't do anything at all — hmm — well — and yet you are sometimes like that disguised handsome boys — — at least you.

Henri ( smiling ). Ah so — ah so!

Uncle ( turning to him ). But wait my boy, when you get old — they'll leave you in your little hem — — when you get old, they'll leave you alone!

Henry. Oh uncle, we youngsters are alone as children — and that is much worse: alone as a child, and alone as a human being — and alone as an artist! In your time, when they still lived together for one thing; for drawing and for painting and — well, each in his "genre"; in your day — you know, sometimes it seems to me that life was as simple as “twice two four” — and well — — now they're all fractions — ha, ha: repeating fractions! ( he mumbles something to himself, while Uncle has risen, but half listening, and looks at another painting; then, interrupting his train of thought ). But — what exactly did you come for?

uncle. — Hmm — exactly! ( curved to a painting, picking his goatee ). That — that sweetie you had here in the past — you know, that little black thing — what's that called again — ?

Henry. Tootje? — — ( understanding where Uncle wants to go ) Ah — — !

uncle. Precisely! — Tootje, that will be it, exactly — ( for the painting ). Look: that's devilishly handsome, you see — that little neck..., hm, you ordered it again for this afternoon, didn't you — ?

Henri ( looks shaking for a moment and smiling at Uncle, who seems to be engrossed in the painting ). Yes - .

uncle. Now send her down for a moment, won't you — ? I might as well use her for a while — just for the little hands, you see, ( looking up from his art appreciation ) just for the little hands: — dearest hands, aren't I... I'll send her back right away.

Henri ( still smiling ). That's good, because I unexpectedly get a new student — this afternoon for the first time, I have to send Tootje away.

uncle. Precisely!

Henry. And Aunt Cor — ?

uncle. My girlfriend is going out.

Henry ( laughing ). Ah...!

Uncle ( stroking his goatee ). Cornelia has to go by train.

Henry. Cornelia — ? Do you call her Cornelia these days?

Uncle ( grinning ). Well no, well no — that's only for Sundays and for festive occasions ( grinning, stroking his goatee ) Cor-ne-lia... wasn't one of those scum in a Shakespearean play called Cornelia?

Henry. Cornelia — ? Cor—Cordelia perhaps you mean? — but I don't think that was a sweep of hell.

uncle. Zoe — that's a pity. Oh, my Cor isn't exactly such a badass, you see — a good woman — but — hm — ( if he sees Cor in the door at that moment ) exactly!

SECOND SCENIC
Henri, Uncle, Cor.

Cor ( a still good-looking, but somewhat over-made-up woman of the population in her forties, quite heavily built, with a full bust. She seems to be dressed on her Sundays, with a very flowery hat, an umbrella and an old-fashioned travel bag. She pushed open the door, which was open, and now she comes in, panting, with the sail drawn up ). How am I now! — Oh, pardon me, Monsieur Henri, but the door stood at — ( to Uncle ). Well, you're a sweetheart too! ( again to Henri ). I'm just about to go there on a trip, and he's walking up! Nice I must say — very nice indeed — !

uncle. My good man, I had just walked upstairs to prepare myself for the farewell, didn't I ( with a wink at Henri, while Cor threatens him with her finger ).

Henry. And where is the journey going?

Cor. Oh, that's no fun, Monsieur Henri — to my child, of course, — where else would I travel! That always takes a whole day—but he's got it right in the asylum—the bum.

Henry. And isn't it getting better?

Cor. After all, that never gets better, does it — an idiot remains an idiot — that's what the doctors say too.

uncle. Well!

Cor ( to Uncle ). Don't pretend you care — even if it's your own!

Uncle ( makes a dismissive gesture with a shrug ).

Cor. It's a beautiful thing to me to walk up like that, just that I have to go away! The train leaves in an hour, oh my god — and you always will when I have to go there, huh; if it's close, it's never to be found. A decent man takes his wife to the train! And you confess: — what did you have to do up here again, just that I have to go, huh? Nothing has been done here at Monsieur Henri's for such an old sweetheart as you!

Henri ( waves his hand reassuringly in defiance ).

uncle. My dear man, I simply needed a new cloth ( grinning, rubbing the back of his hand ), a new sheet.

cor. Ajasses, stop with your “new skins”! If you're like that, I simply can't stand you.

uncle. Well — it was different for you, Melieve: — I'd still love to make a new face of you.

Cor. Hear such an old slampamper! He's making fun of me again — oh, he's such a rascal! ( grabbing uncle by the sleeve ). Well, tell me, old sir — we're going down right now.

Henry. — — Well, as for the eyes ( half to Uncle, half to Cor ) — she still has a pair of beautiful eyes.

Cor ( uncles sleeve letting go again ). Oh so! Monsieur Henri, my eyes...

uncle. Well — but for a naked model — that is no longer possible.

Cor. Hear him! — hear that now! ( she hits the tense bust ). Those young brash bitches of today can't compete with that — those flatfish! That may still be seen, Monsieur Henri! And the gentlemen at the Academy used to know that too: — they would have loved to have me there as a nude model — but I didn't want to — always been a private model with the boys — and always with all honor and virtue, you know.

Henri ( in front of him ). Barring the exceptions.

Cor ( only half understanding him, threatens him with his finger ). Yes, don't believe that, Monsieur Henri! In our time, then it was still a beautiful profession, in our time it was still 'real', isn't it — but nowadays the boys just get everything from the street — from those girls who can't even stand a dramatic position — — well, I don't care about the whole movement anymore, you know. But he - ! — such an old sweetheart, eh — would you believe that he would still like to pinch the cat in the dark? ( grabbing uncle by the sleeve again ). Will you keep an eye on him today, Monsieur Henri?

Henry. I promise.

Cor ( uncle pulling his goatee ). Are you coming with me, you old pervert?

Uncle ( putting his arm around her ). Precisely! — such a sweet treat — and yet so elegant! ( they go together, leading each other to the door, where Uncle turns briefly to Henri, pointing the finger downwards ). So - ?

Henri ( nods laughing. Cor and uncle off ).

THIRD SCENIC
Henri, then Nellie.

Henri ( smilingly knocks out his pipe, and shrugs and sits down in front of his donkey again; muttering to himself ). “In Our Time”​—“In Our Time!” — ( shaking his head ) and then hang like that! ( there is a knock ). Yes! ( looking over his shoulder ). Ah!

Nellie ( beautiful figure of about twenties, faithful glance in a face that is not very strongly drawn, but young and lively, city hair with dark brown hair. Tripping inwards ). There I am!

Henry. Well, it was about time too, — I'm waiting — I'm waiting! ( jumping ) and now we're going to start right away!

Nellie ( quietly taking off her hat in front of the mantelpiece ). Well, you're in a rush again — can I take a breather? ( she sits down on the couch ).

Henry. No: — one kiss, and then begin! ( he sits down next to her, kisses her, takes her hand and kisses her neck ).

Nellie. Well — ! Well!

Henry. That's to get upset! "Uncle was here, and Cor.

Nellie. That old dragon too? — and what did they have?

Henry. Uncle came first, didn't you — ask me to send Tootje — you know that I ordered Tootje for this afternoon to try it for the left-wing figure — ? Just for an impression — ( if Nellie includes ) — well don't be surprised about that, because I just can't use her, because that new student comes from me, — I had forgotten all about Tootje. Well, then she can go straight to Uncle — — Aunt Cor had to leave town again — you understand! — and then she came to fetch him herself. ( they laugh together ). Yes, to walk into it like that: to marry her! Although: she takes good care of him--he doesn't deserve better,--but still- (looking at her from the side, while he stands up with a smile† No Nellie — we don't do that well, do we?

Nellie ( a little concerned ). Nor are you asked.

Henry. Well, that's nonsense, you can still have it well together, you can still love each other — but: get married ( for themselves ) those painterly marriages with...

Nellie. Nor are you asked.

Henry. Damn, I've talked to you about that so many times! Surely you said that yourself: love must be free — and art must be free — you cannot bind that. When love is free, then it is the surest and most beautiful Nel, then it is real — but to marry — ? — then you put your love under a cloche — that's nonsense after all!

Nellie. I know you don't love me.

Henry. Well, God bless — “don't love you” — ! Oh girl, I love you way too much after all — don't you? ( in love ). Little animal that gets me out every time! — I should love you a little less, then the work would go better — because every time I see you and not my work: then I'm in it — and then you lie looking at me with your brown eyes — then I see nothing then your eyes — oh, you — you! — — And you know that very well!

Nellie ( soon recovered ). Well, I might as well have some of it. ( cuddly ). I'm just for you anyway — and if I'm still sitting in front of others, it's just clothed — — and if you don't want it, I won't either!

Henry. You are a cutie! — Wait: ( he takes out a piece of paper with chocolates from the cupboard ) look — I saved that for you from Sunday, at my family — — my sister's birthday.

Nellie. Oh — ! — that's sweet of you again — you're dear!

Henry. And now let's start!

Nellie. ( gives him a kiss and starts to unbutton her blouse ).

Henry. No, just the headline today — I need to get the headline a little better first. ( he sits down before the donkey ).

Nellie. O — ( she assumes a half-reclining pose as in the painting, with arms under her head ). Zoe — isn't it?

Henry. Yes — no, wait : ( he stands up and tilts her head slightly, tickling her ).

Nellie ( flying with a scream ). Hey no! — now you're confusing yourself again! I lay well — ( she lies down again ).Henri ( arranging the pillows ). So — yes — so ( he sits down in front of the donkey again and looks again ) that's all right. ( he paints. Silence ).

Nellie ( in front of him ). — So — was that Cor here — — what a man, isn't he.

Henri ( painting ). Well — ( silence ).

Nellie. I can't understand that that model was — huh — — ?

Henry. No — ( silence ).

Nellie. And uncle, — nice man indeed — nice indeed — but my husband is much nicer — ( silence. In front of her, while she keeps giving her shoe a rocking air ) — Hénri — Hári — Hánni — Hénk — Hénnie — no: Hannie, that's what I like best ( flattering ) — “Hánnie” — !

Henri ( painting ). No: “Henri” ( looking up with an emphasis on an equally irritable tone ) “Hén-rì”! ( silence ).

Nellie ( in his same tone ). Hén-rì — — and Nél-liè — . ( silence ). Say, did I ever tell you that I have a cousin who is also called Henri? — but I call him Hank.

Henry. Well, but now shut up! ( silence. There is a knock ). Yes - !

FOURTH SCENIC
Henri, Nellie, Herman.

Herman ( about the same age as Henri, but apparently from a poorer position. With his pale forehead, always clammy, his flax-red hair, and his shoulders somewhat too high, he doesn't seem very healthy. He wears a old-fashioned pelerine turned green. Carefully opening the door and looking in ). Can I come in - ?

Henri ( watchful ). Oh, is it you! - come on in! — ( painting ). Long time no see!

Herman ( surprised to find Nellie too, enters hesitantly ). No — how are you, — ( Henri, then also Nellie's hand ) so — I'll hit that!

Nellie ( looked up briefly when Herman came in, but immediately kept the same pose, in which she doesn't move until Henri stands up, — shaking his hand ). Day. †

Henri ( beckons with brush ). Sit down — sit down.

Herman ( stays behind Henri and looks alternately at the painting and at Nellie ). Dear — dear — !

Henry. No, not at all sweet — it won't be "dear" at all!

Herman ( confused ). No — I mean — the — it — I mean — ( he turns a little shyly and finds a seat ).

Henri ( painting ). Yes — you'd make something sweet of it.

Nellie ( whitewashing ). Well, he made me a very nice one recently, used to — dressed — with that blue blouse — ( with her eyes to Herman ) remember?

Herman ( clumsy ). I mean — your model: the model is sweet. ( Nellie sighs and Henri laughs along with a smirk. Wiping the back of his hand over his forehead, recovering ). I actually came just because of Nellie, didn't I — that is: ( to Nellie ) I didn't have the new address after you moved — well — I came here for a moment — I thought Henri might know the number, — I knew: same street...

Nellie. One hundred and forty-three two high.

Hermann. O — wait: ( he notes carefully in a notebook ) "one hundred and forty-three — two high," — — I had an idea, you see...

Henri ( painting ). Yes — but I can't miss her!

Hermann. Well, of course it's just to make an appointment; ( standing behind him ) I see, you're done with her pretty soon — and then——

Henry. "Done with it"? — ( he pushes palette and brushes away, jumping up ) "done"? — I'll never finish it! Time and again I am out: then this, then that, always something else — I can't stay in it damned!

Hermann. Oh — but if I come inconvenient... ( he makes motion to leave ).

Henry. Well no, well no dude — no, that's not the point. I just want to say in general, eh: I just wanted to make something beautiful out of it, you see — I thought, maybe for an exhibition or something, — and the plan was so damn good — and now I get stuck and i'm sucking on it...

Hermann. No, but... ( makes motion again for goodbye ).

Henri ( holding him back ). Oh no, dude, really — — , but after all, you know that yourself ( with a sigh ): from the beautiful design to the beautiful end, eh — that's the choice! ( looking at Nellie, who has risen from her pose and is eating a bonbon ) and Nellie is a good model - ( with a slanted eye at Herman ) you know her - beautiful, excellent for the pose, and pretty enough true, but ...

Nellie. What "but" — ?

Henri ( tapping her on the nose ). You've got a pretty figure Nel, and a pretty face — well — but sometimes I want more, don't I: — the "ideal" model, how shall I say, it should live itself, you see, I mean "sympathize" — I mean, as it were, 'painting along', in short: destroy the soul, eh — a body isn't enough — .

Hermann ( delicately ). Yes, you always want to have everything, don't you — the body and the soul — and the heart — .

Nellie ( springing up ). Yes, he always wants everything! — and don't I give you everything — ? ( to Herman ) But he's such a difficult guy, isn't he — sometimes I don't understand what he really wants.

Henry. No, that's right; ( pondering ) the "ideal" model — "the" model — — but... ( looking at his watch ). O! but it's also already — God, and that's true: Jules and Frits would be having a cup of coffee! ( to Herman, who is preparing to leave again ). No, of course you stay too — no, but then we'll set up a complete lunch! ( he rolls the donkey back a bit, rearranges the chairs, etc. while Herman hangs up his hat and coat ).

Nellie ( who has sat down on the couch again and eats a bonbon, with a long pull ) "Lnch" — "lunch" — hà that sounds nice, say — what does he say that nice: "lunch" — , what is "lunch" actually ” — ?

Henri ( imitating her ). "Having lunch" - ? that is giving you a kiss in the neck! ( he kisses her; then, clapping his hands ). And now to work guys! ( he counts on his fingers ). There's bread — but not enough — eggs, cheese, coffee — you'll find it all in the kitchenette Nellie — then I'll go get some cigars — and some more bread — and sardines ( writing on his cuffs ).

Nellie. Hey, sardines! — but I can do that, can't I?

Henry. No, you brought the wrong one last time! Now prepare everything and make the coffee — and then you can make the omelette right away — you can do that so beautifully.

Nellie. Fine — ( to Herman ) he taught me that himself, say — — ( urgently to Henri ) But come on, let me fetch that.

Henri ( going to the door and taking his hat, while Nellie leads to the door ). No, get ready and make some coffee — I have to go down for cigars myself anyway, and it's close by. ( off ).Nellie ( comes back from the door hesitantly, rummages around the table, disappears into the kitchen and starts preparing ).

Herman ( sitting next to the table follows her with his eyes; he sighs; silence ). Is it still like that — ?

Nellie. Oh Henkie, don't start about that again.

Herman ( walks around painfully and stands in front of the donkey ). I came to say — I came to ask if you — after this thing — came again — for a new play; ( turning to her ) white! and gray and blue — a nymph, like a dream in a forest.

Nellie ( always busy ). Yes, maybe later, eh — but now I can't. ( nodding to the painting ). That has to be done first — and then — — I'm his now, isn't it.

Herman ( with a defensive gesture, then wiping his forehead with the back of his hand ). But — after all, your figure is almost finished, — and then you promise me — then you'll come again — for the nymph — I must have you then, you see — ( he sits down again and presses closer ) I must — .

Nellie ( opposite him, cutting bread ). Oh Henkie, don't whine — I'm here now.

Hermann. "Here"—"here" ( bitter ) here have been so many.

Nellie ( provoked ). Oh, what — "been here a lot" — and what do you know about that! That's just because you're jealous. ( silence ). So what? — I'm just a model after all! — I am free after all! ( silence ). Oh Henkie, when I came to you, I was just a sheep.

Herman ( springing up ). Yes — yes, that's it! I was the first, wasn't it — and then you don't see so closely! and now that you've got the taste, now you want to get to know the others too! — — Then get to know them! all — one after the other — then you will see what egoists they are! egoists! egoists! — — the whole world is selfish! ( silence, coming to her again, softer ). But what I felt for you, you see — you won't find that again — you see. ( he sits down again, while she cuts bread. Silence ). Do you remember — you always cut bread with me like that, Nellie — we had a good time together, Nel — — don't you love me at all then — say — ?

Nellie ( softer ). Oh yes boy - oh yes - . ( She makes coffee, putting her arm across the table ).

Herman ( grabbing her hand ). We were so good together, say—couldn't it stay like this—? can't it be like this anymore, Nel — ? I need you so much — I can't miss you anymore —! I can't do without you!

Nellie ( withdrawing her hand ). Oh no, Henkie — come on! I'll come — yes, I'll come — for posing — maybe, ( hunting ) but now not — now I'm here, now I'm his — and I love him! — I love him — there: I love him!

Hermann. St — ! St! — not so out loud! — ( he gets up, walks around moaning, — then back to the table ). How can you say that to me!

Nellie ( a bit startled at her own outburst ). Well — ( listening, — relieved ). Here they come — !

Hermann ( hasty ). You never talk to him about — us — do you?

Nellie. Oh no.
