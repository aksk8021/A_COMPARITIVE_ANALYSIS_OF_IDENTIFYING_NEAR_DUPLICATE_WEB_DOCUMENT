! No, sir! It doesn’t matter much about me, but you—you’re not to be in this at all, except I don’t want us ever to be not chums, Bill.”

Rapid footsteps were coming along the hall then; the door opened and Tony and Sadler burst into the room.

“He’s all right, Grier. He’s come to.”

“Yes, mio amico; Siebold, this Sadler say, is again recover. You no need longer to fear. But, ah! They tell it to me that he a sight presents. He will go to his classes the observed. And it serves him all the right; is it not so? And the most to do is to explain the Doctor for you—which we all do.”

CHAPTER XVI
ONE WINTER SATURDAY
Marshallton is a village with nothing more than two general stores sufficient to cater to the needs of the near neighborhood and the Tech students. Guilford, nine miles away, is the railroad town and, now and then, for extra supplies the Tech boys may spend a dull half hour each way on the trolley to visit the quiet place which holds no other attraction than the stores.

Bill, Gus and Tony, eager to get some radio supplies that might as well have been ordered from the city, obtained leave to run over to Guilford and back. To show his appreciation of their friendship, Tony decided to treat Bill and Gus to a taxi ride; so he ’phoned to the town for one. It came and the three piled in, much elated over 139the prospect of a pleasant shopping trip, though the weather was a little stormy.

The purchasing took all that was left of the morning. The boys gathered their things into bundles and, at Tony’s command, made straightway for a restaurant. Being a senior, he claimed entire charge of these freshmen.

“You not respon—no; it is that you are irresponsible,” he said as he demanded the privilege of paying all expenses. “We will get,” he laughed, “some spaghetti and I show you to eat. You like eet?”

They did. The clean tables and pleasant interior were attractive. The boys stamped the newly fallen snow from their feet, and opened their coats to the genial warmth. Then they turned to meet the waiter and glanced up with something of a shock. Luigi Malatesta stood before them and addressed them collectively:

“I am proprietor of this. We serve only gentlemen. You will go to—to—to—elsewhere.”140

Gus leaped up, forgetting the fright after his last fisticuffs. He wanted to punch this villain again.

“Listen, you confounded nuisance! This is a public place and we demand—” He got no further, for Tony’s hand was on his arm.

“Attendate, mio amico—wait! Would you eat eats in a such place? We might all getta the poison here. Mucho better we go of our selves.”

Malatesta beat a hasty retreat. The lads went out and along the street to another place equally attractive and there they ate unsparingly, the while discussing their latest experience, though Tony was silent on that. Finally Bill and Gus fell into his mood. They came out of the restaurant after an hour, to find that the storm had increased, a stiff, knife-edged wind driving the snow horizontally and making drifts. The taxi driver at the garage looked dubious, but agreed to try for Marshallton. The worst that could happen would be a night spent at some farmhouse.141

The storm increased rapidly, the snow turning partly to sleet piled up in long windrows across all half-sheltered places, leaving open spots bare, so that the road resembled the storm waves of a white and foaming ocean. The car skidded along on icy ground one minute, and the next its wheels were buried in caked drifts.

The boys were peering out, watching the strange effects of the storm, but noting with greater concern the slowing up of the taxi. Then they stopped.

“Reckon we can’t make it,” said the jolly, round-faced taxi driver. They could not stay there in the road. It was imperative that they should find a shelter somewhere. Not half a mile ahead there was a farmhouse in which they might all be made welcome and comfortable.

Again the man had proved to be correct. The boys agreed that forecasting the weather and the social geography of that region were in his line. He tried to run on again, but the starter refused 142to boost the engine and the battery nearly gave out. Bill insisted that they crank up and not exhaust the battery, else they would come to a dead stop. Gus and Tony lent a hand in turning the engine over and soon they were again bucking the drifts, stalling the engine two or three times within the next three hundred yards. A drift faced them that was altogether beyond hope, and before they drove into it, Bill insisted that they back over the thinner snow to the side of the road so that they would not be hit by another car if one should pull through such roads.

“Now then, you fellows!” said Bill, as usual assuming command where anything important was at stake. “Go on to the farmhouse and bunk, if they’ll have you. I’ll wrap up in these robes and be as warm as toast here in the car.” It was an enclosed tonneau, the window sashes fitted tightly and two big robes promised a little comfort.

“Yes, you will,” said Gus sarcastically.143

“Not!” declared Tony. “We can easy carry you. You say it—pig-on-back?”

The taxi driver joined in and helped the two boys in this, also.

“Did you say there’s a farmhouse just on ahead, Mr.——?” asked Gus.

“Merritt is my name,” answered the driver.

“And a roadside is your station. You’re fast in the snow and you cannot go and you’re mad at all creation,” said Bill.

“You’re right, son, about bein’ stuck, but I ain’t mad. Reckon I stand to lose on this trip, but——”

“No, my friend; you will not lose one cent,” exclaimed Tony. “More, you shall make well. We are not the unappreciatives, ever. Show us this farmer estate and entitle us to be his guests and you shall want for nothing—eh, my friends Bill and Gus?”

“You’ve said it, Tony, and you are the cheese.”

“Ah, no; I am but the macaroni. Do you think this farmer will cook the spaghetti?”144

“Not likely, but Farrell sits down to a good table, I reckon,” Merritt ventured. “Well, young fellers, let’s mosey on. It’ll be stiff goin’, though ’tain’t more’n a quarter of a mile now.”

It was stiff going. Bill managed to get through the thin places and they helped him through fast increasing drifts, Gus at last getting him on his back for a “gain,” as he expressed it, of fifty yards. Then Tony took a turn for a like distance, and Gus and Mr. Merritt crossed hands to “carry a lady to London”; so they would have got Bill along for a considerable distance had they not come opposite the end of a lane, with the dim outline of a house standing back.

Up the lane they went, hearing the muffled barking of a dog. The side door of the house opened, a big farmer with a huge voice greeted them cheerily. He was in his shirt sleeves, which argued for comfort inside the dwelling, and there was an air of comfort in the broad hallway that was gratifying. The three were received like young 145princes and ushered into a large sitting-room. From their chairs before a big stove, a pleasant woman and two young girls rose to welcome the wayfarers.

Merritt they knew by name, and he began an apologetic effort to account for their coming, but Bill took the matter in hand.

“Mr. Farrell, aren’t you? And I suppose this is Mrs. Farrell. My name is Brown and these are my friends, Mr. Sabaste and Mr. Grier; we are all students at Marshallton. Went in to Guilford to the stores and couldn’t make it going back, though Mr. Merritt put up a good fight with his little car. And now we are going to ask you if you can keep us for the night,—table and spare room? Anything that is handy, for we don’t want to give you trouble and we’ll pay——”

“Ah, the best. As if you are one fine hotel, because no such could give to us more of comfort.” This from Tony, who was always most liberal and eager to please. So saying, he pulled out ten 146one-dollar bills and gallantly tendered it to the lady, with a nod and smile at the farmer.

“That’s right. The wife has all the trouble. You boys are welcome; eh, Sarah?”

“But John, this is too much. I could not accept such a large amount for so little.”

“Mother,” said one of the girls, coming forward, “you should not accept anything at all.”

“Well, now, Mary, I guess you’re right. This is our daughter, young gentlemen, and she always has her way.”

“But she has not consider the way to justice,” said Tony, his black eyes flashing conviction. “We give that, or we not remain; even it is too little.”

“Yes, considering the storm, our predicament and our coming in on you this way, unasked, we can’t consent to less,” Bill added.

“Mabel, come here, girl,” said the housewife, laughing. “This is my niece. She’s making her home with us. Now, all you young folks and Mr. 147Merritt enjoy yourselves while I get supper and father does the barn work.”

The boys never forgot that long, yet all too short winter evening; the wholesome food; the dish of home-made candy; the fireside game of “twenty questions”; the music played by Mabel on the old-fashioned square piano, while Mary and Tony danced; the lively conversation and Bill’s exhibition of so-called mind reading—really muscle reading, during which, with Mrs. Farrell and Mabel holding his wrists, he found, blindfolded, a hidden pocket knife.

Merritt had slipped out early to open the radiator of his car, which he had foolishly forgotten to do. He had come back and called Bill aside for a moment.

“There’s another car down the road, just beyond mine; a big one and nobody about. I went along apiece to look at it and I think I know who it belongs to—that there new Eyetalian hash-house feller in Guilford. Only one car there like 148it and that’s his’n. You was askin’ about him bein’ in Guilford.”

“Yes. We know him and he knows us. He could have found out you were taking us home and then have seen your car here and waited.”

“You mean follered you? What’d he want to do——?”

“Is he still in his car?” interrupted Bill.

“I reckon so; think I saw four fellers in it. They can keep warm there and every now and then run their engine a bit to keep her from freezin’ up.”

“They’ll be drifted in, won’t they?”

“Reckon not, with a big car like that; and the storm’s goin’ to quit.”

“But that won’t let us go on to-night. And what is that Italian up to?” Bill dismissed the subject with Merritt, but resolved to tell Gus, though not Tony, as it would put a damper on their friend’s peace of mind. What harm could come of Malatesta’s being here? He could not 149approach the house without alarming the Farrell dog and that was assurance enough. And Bill could not help being doubtful as to the Sicilian’s being really dangerous. There might be such a thing as carrying this grudge business to extremes, but hardly here and in this storm.

Bill and Gus spent the night in the best spare room, under the heavy covers of an immense fourposter. They slept through the cold night like inanimate objects. Tony, alone, occupied a room which had evidently been that of an only son who had gone away to the Great War to remain away forever. There was crape hanging over the frame of a picture showing a sturdy, manly looking fellow in khaki. From the appearance of things, Tony, also, should have passed a comfortable night. Merritt was tucked away to his entire satisfaction.

150
CHAPTER XVII
KIDNAPED
In the morning Bill and Gus were up at daylight, as was their habit. The storm had ceased, and it was turning warm, the snow melting already. The boys went to the barn to help with the milking; they got in some wood and performed other chores. Mr. Farrell, coming in, declared with his hearty laugh that they could stay as long as they might wish to, for they had certainly more than earned their food and lodging. As they went in to the breakfast table he said.

“Mother, better give that other young fellow his money back. Where is he, anyway? Not down yet?”

“Not yet,” said Mrs. Farrell, “though I called him twice.”151

“I’ll get him up and down,” said Gus, going toward the stairway.

“Father, have you seen Gyp?” asked Mary Farrell. “I’ve called him too, but he doesn’t come for his breakfast.”

The farmer shook his head and, stepping to the back door, whistled sharply and at length. Turning to come in he heard a low whine and a quick search found the dog, lying on his side and unable to rise, his eyes dull and bloodshot, his tongue protruding. Mr. Farrell had seen something of the sort before. He picked up the poor little beast and carried him to a warm bed by the kitchen stove.

“Sarah, he’s been poisoned! Nothing else. Getting over it, though. What—?” And then they heard Gus calling from above.

“Bill! Bill! Come up here, quick! Tony’s gone!”

It was true and the manner of his going was very apparent. The room had been entered from 152without, noiselessly and by experts. Taking advantage not only of the lad’s sleeping soundly, the housebreakers had used some anæsthetic, for a wad of cotton that smelled like a drug store lay on the carpet. Tony had evidently been roughly dressed. His collar, necktie and cap lay on the bureau and his stockings on the floor. That he had been carried out of the window and to the ground was certain. The two ends of the ladder had left their imprint in the snow in the sill and on the ground. The ladder itself had been thrown among the bushes.

Kidnaped! There was no question about that; but how could such a thing have happened? A sturdy boy, able to put up a fight, and the thing done so silently as not to waken a soul in the house. Healthy, sound sleepers, depending on a dog—and that poor beast put down and out. Poor Tony! What would they do with him!

Bill and Gus hastily related their affair with the ugly Sicilian and that of which Tony had told 153them. They at once found that the big car had turned about and gone. Footprints in the snow proved that the occupants of the car had been the kidnapers.

The farmer and his family were duly excited over the case. Nothing so dramatic had ever before happened to them. Merritt was also wrought up to a pretty high pitch, for Tony had hired him very generously. The young Italian had shown himself to be a courteous, well-bred gentleman and had commanded respect. The manner of his disappearance, and the possible tragedy lurking behind it, had earned the sympathy of them all.

But the Farrells deferred everything to Bill and Gus who were both eager to act, and to investigate the too evident, yet mysterious crime, though they were rendered helpless by the snow-piled roads.

“We’ll have to use your ’phone, Mr. Farrell,” said Bill. “We will pay all the tolls. We’ve got to make this thing known and put Tony’s people 154wise. His father’s a wealthy Italian banker in the city, and he’ll begin to move things when he hears about this.” He turned to Gus: “If we could only get to the school and get a whack at the transmitter, couldn’t we make things hum?”

“Why, my lads,” said Mr. Farrell, “that is just the thing to do and I can get you there in a hurry. These automobiles have got it all over our horses for speed, but not for power. My bays will land you at the school in short order and through the biggest snow that you ever saw. Wait till I hitch them up to the Dearborn.”

He was as good as his word. After promising to keep the Farrells and Merritt posted as to the progress of the hunt for Tony and its outcome, they were on the road behind a pair of splendid, steaming, plunging horses, and soon back at the Tech. The Doctor, about to depart for church, was startled by the news, and he at once turned the transmitting station over to the boys, going himself to the ’phone and keeping it busy. Mr. 155Farrell remained a short time. Then wishing the boys success, he departed.

The county detective, the mounted police force, the city force and a private detective agency were all informed of the circumstance, with a full description of Luigi Malatesta. The incident became a “nine-days’ wonder” in the newspapers. Soon it was learned that the Sicilian had, on the very day before Tony’s disappearance, sold his restaurant in Guilford for a song. He had disappeared with several others, questionable characters with whom he had been associated, and on whom he had evidently relied to do the kidnaping. It was discovered also, through the confession of a Sicilian suspect, that Tony had been shadowed for weeks as he went about the school.

But all knowledge of the boy’s whereabouts was totally lacking. Clues were run down without success. The search had failed. Mr. Sabaste, with a famous detective, came to the school and talked with Bill and Gus. He went with them to see 156the Farrells, where he investigated every detail. The search went far and wide, with no trace of Tony.

The banker offered five thousand dollars for information that would insure his son’s return, and smaller sums for any positive data, which might lead to the arrest of the kidnapers. Tony’s mother was dead. An older brother who had been in business in the far west was once a victim of the Malatesta clan. In spite of every possible effort, the disappearance of the boy remained a mystery; nor could any of the Malatesta relatives, known by various names and suspected as accomplices, be found.

Bill and Gus were now in possession of one of the finest radio receiving sets that could be made, and several other students had purchased similar, or less perfect, sets from the boys. Whenever opportunity permitted they either had the loud speaker on, or sat with the ’phones clamped to their ears, listening in and having much amusement 157with the various broadcasters, public and private. It was a liberal education to hear a tenth of what was going on, besides the regular concert program each evening. But most in their thoughts was the hope, often expressed between them, of hearing something that might in some way reflect on the kidnaping mystery, for the boys missed their kind and courteous Italian friend.

158
CHAPTER XVIII
DIPLOMACY THAT FAILED
“Gus, I can’t get it out of my head,” said Bill one day, “that we’re not, as they say in diplomatic language, entirely persona grata here. At least, not as we should want to be if we have the proper loyalty to the school. We have our friends, of course, among seniors, freshmen and even some of the sophs, but the sophs generally have very little use for us. Even some of our own class, in the sports, have a big leaning toward Siebold and his bunch, and they like to go along with the shouters.”

“Well, I guess they’ll have to go along, then,” remarked Gus indifferently.

“But Gus, it’s a reflection on us. We ought to be in as good fellowship as anybody. Now that we’ve made out so well in our radio work 159and are not nearly so busy, with the rest of the term all lectures and exams, you know, we might gee in a little with the social end of it. And sports, too, Gus. I can’t do anything but look on and shout, but you——”

Bill’s remarks were inspired by a glimpse across the greensward at a bunch of fellows on the ball field, evidently at town ball and practice. With the coming of spring and warm weather the Tech ball team had been newly organized and put at practice. The next month would see them crossing bats with Guilford Academy, Springdale School and other nearby institutions. There was great rivalry between the home team and Guilford Academy, which had a strong team, and was much the better of the two, except that the Tech School had acquired, through Siebold’s efforts, a very good outside pitcher who kept the Academy lads guessing much of the time. The winning of games, therefore, during the preceding season had been pretty even, Guilford leading by one.160

And then, at the behest of older and more judicial heads, representatives of the League of Schools had met and decided that each team must play only with members of its student body, hiring no semi-professional pitchers, or even coachers, thus making the contests entirely fair.

A result of this was that in the games of this season Guilford, with a pitcher from among its fellows who had previously given his services to other teams as well, simply ran away with Marshallton Tech, winning one game by the score of fifteen to two and the other was a shut-out.

“Gus, I’ve bought a ball and I’ve got Sam Kerry, who says he used to catch for his home team somewhere in the west, to agree to keep his mouth shut and pass a few with you, off somewhere where nobody will see.”

“Righto, old Bill! Anything you say—but what’s the idea?”

“Well, Gus, I don’t like Guilford’s swamping this team in the way it has, and I propose to try 161to stop it.” Bill’s lips were compressed and he had that look in his eyes that meant determination.

“But Siebold—” began Gus.

“Doesn’t entirely run this school, nor its ball team, even if he is captain and general high muck-a-muck,” declared Bill.

It was with extreme satisfaction that Bill sat on a log at one side of a path in the woods and watched little Kerry, who proved to be no mean hand at stopping all kinds of balls, nearly knocked off his feet by the machine-gun-like pitches of “that other fellow from Freeport,” as Gus was sometimes called.

One early afternoon the gym instructor also sat by Bill and watched the performance. Mr. Gay had promised secrecy, but not to refrain from comment.

“I’ll say he has not only got command of his ball and three good styles, but he also knows some tricks that ought to worry any man at the bat. Throw that waiting ball again, Grier!” the instructor 162called. “I want to watch that—oh, fine! It looks like a hard one and a fellow will strike over it nine times out of ten. Well, I’ve got this to say: If we expect to win any games we’ve got to have a fellow like Grier in the box, but Siebold will stick to Maxwell who is about a fifth rater—at his best.”

“But has Siebold all the say?” Bill queried.

“A good deal of it. You see his father backs up the boy in everything, and he has put the club on its feet financially, in a bigger way than even the Guilford team. Moreover, the elder Siebold’s money built our grandstand, the dressing-rooms and hired our pitchers for quite a while. So young Siebold can afford to play politics and insure a following, which nobody, even the professors, can stop. And the faculty and the Doctor don’t bother over the matter. That chap is going to be a state senator, or a Congressman some day, I have no doubt.”

“It won’t work, though, Mr. Gay,” declared 163Bill, “because it isn’t justice. Others besides Siebold are interested in and loyal to the school. We want to see our team win, don’t we?”

“Yes, of course. I’m going to shoot that at Siebold and, if you’ll let me, I’m going to hint that we have a pitcher among us who outranks his choice in all the high points.”

It was on the next afternoon, which was rainy, that Bill found the library pretty full of readers and among them were six or seven of the ball team. He took a seat beside Dixon and directly across the table from Siebold and Sadler. He turned to Dixon:

“When is the next ball game?” he asked.

“We play Springdale next Saturday, but they’re easy. The last game with Guilford is Saturday week.”

“It’s too bad that we get licked so unmercifully when there’s no need for it,” Bill remarked.

“No need for it? No, there’s no need for it, but——”164

“I suppose we have needed it to put some sense into us, but no longer. It would be pretty easy to clean that bunch if we went at it right.”

“How easy?” asked Dixon.

“Why, you know without asking that. Putting a good man in the box and another behind the bat, of course.”

“Where’d you get your good man?”

“Here in the school.”

“Who?”

“I guess you’ll have to keep your eyes open. Anybody ought to——”

“Listen to this, Siebold.” Dixon leaned over the table. “Brown says we’ve got pitching material——”

“Well, what of it? Don’t I know it?”

“It’s a blamed sure bet he doesn’t know it, or if he does he ought to be jailed for conspiracy to beat the school team,” laughed Bill, still addressing Dixon.

“How’s that, Brown? What’s your dope?” 165ventured Sadler, who alone really dared to question Siebold’s authority. Bill went on, in forcible language, for he was aware that Siebold was listening, and repeated what he had said to Mr. Gay and to Dixon. The argument about every one in the school being interested in the success of the ball team seemed to strike home, and several boys gathering round began to make comments favorable to the sentiment. The librarian came over and objected to the talking.

“Let’s go down to the gym and talk this thing over,” said Sadler. “Brown will spring this man on us if we’ll try him—eh, Brown?”

“Why, sure,” said Bill, rising.

“Come on, Siebold.”

“Too busy reading. Nothing to it, anyway.” Siebold didn’t even look up from his book.

“Is that so?” Sadler was angry. It was evident that he was willing to oppose the captain. Bill thought he saw an opportunity right here.166

“He has only one vote,” he said, “and I understand that all of us who care to may have a say. I know several fellows who——”

Bill got no further. Siebold began to see that it might be best to permit no defection from his ranks and no outside interference. He followed the others out and across the campus, no word being said all the way by the several boys who, in part, made up the executive committee on baseball. They filed into the gym and got Mr. Gay into their conference.

“Now, then, Brown, what have you got under your skin?” said Siebold testily.

“You heard me in the library,” said Bill.

“Balderdash! There isn’t a fellow in the school who can pitch like Maxwell.”

“Oh, yes, there is, Siebold,” said Mr. Gay. “There’s no one who can play first base like Maxwell and your first baseman says he has a glass arm and is done. We have a pitcher who can pitch.”167

“That’s the cheese!” said Maxwell. “I’ve told Siebold all along he ought to replace me.”

“Who is this wonderful guy?” asked Siebold.

“I’ll bet it’s that other fellow from Freeport,” put in one of the captain’s staunch supporters.

“Call it off in that case,” Siebold demanded.

“No, we won’t call it off. We’ll try him at practice,” said Sadler.

“Who’s captain of this team? We’ll play in our present positions, all of us, or we won’t play at all.”

“That’s right,” echoed two or three followers. Bill laughed.

“Will you accept a challenge to play a school scrub team?”

“No, nor that. Waste of time——”

“That’s nothing but silly stubbornness,” said Sadler, with rising wrath. “Wouldn’t it be just like practice? You’re a fatheaded——”

“Oh, now, see here, Siebold,” interposed the instructor. “You can’t refuse that. It will only 168bring out the best players and strengthen the team.”

“Well, then, if Mr. Gay says so,” Siebold agreed, “we’ll play you and we can shut out any bunch you can get together.”

169
CHAPTER XIX
A SHUT-OUT
Bill turned to Sadler. “You’re with us?”

“Sure, Siebold has a substitute for right field.”

“I’m with you, too,” said Dixon. “Put Longy in my place, Cap.”

Siebold grew angry. “You fellows have been kickers all along, and now you think that will weaken us. Well, if Ritter can’t take a fly better than you can, you big stiff, I’ll assassinate him; and Long is as good a short stop as you are, Dixon.”

“We have four other substitutes and I’ll promise three of them for our scrub team, Brown,” Sadler declared.

“All right; that’s seven fellows and we can pick up two more, surely. Let’s hunt them up right now,” demanded Bill.
