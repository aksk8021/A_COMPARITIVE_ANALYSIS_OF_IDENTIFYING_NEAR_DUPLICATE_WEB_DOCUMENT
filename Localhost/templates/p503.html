   An admirable statement of the aims of the Library of Philosophy

was provided by the first editor, the late Professor J. H.

Muirhead, in his description of the original programme printed in

Erdmann’s History of Philosophy under the date 1890. This was

slightly modified in subsequent volumes to take the form of the

following statement:

 

“The Muirhead Library of Philosophy was designed as a

contribution to the History of Modern Philosophy under the heads:

first of Different Schools of Thought—Sensationalist, Realist,

Idealist, Intuitivist; secondly of different

Subjects—Psychology, Ethics, Aesthetics, Political Philosophy,

Theology. While much had been done in England in tracing the

course of evolution in nature, history, economics, morals and

religion, little had been done in tracing the development of

thought on these subjects. Yet ‘the evolution of opinion is part

of the whole evolution’.

 

“By the co-operation of different writers in carrying out this

plan it was hoped that a thoroughness and completeness of 

treatment, otherwise unattainable, might be secured. It was

believed also that from writers mainly British and American

fuller consideration of English Philosophy than it had hitherto

received might be looked for. In the earlier series of books

containing, among others, Bosanquet’s “History of Aesthetic,”

Pfleiderer’s “Rational Theology since Kant,” Albee’s “History of

English Utilitarianism,” Bonar’s “Philosophy and Political

Economy,” Brett’s “History of Psychology,” Ritchie’s “Natural

Rights,” these objects were to a large extent effected.

 

“In the meantime original work of a high order was being produced

both in England and America by such writers as Bradley, Stout, 

Bertrand Russell, Baldwin, Urban, Montague, and others, and a new

interest in foreign works, German, French and Italian, which had

either become classical or were attracting public attention, had

developed. The scope of the Library thus became extended into

something more international, and it is entering on the fifth

decade of its existence in the hope that it may contribute to

that mutual understanding between countries which is so pressing

a need of the present time.”

 

The need which Professor Muirhead stressed is no less pressing

to-day, and few will deny that philosophy has much to do with

to-day, and few will deny that philosophy has much to do with

enabling us to meet it, although no one, least of all Muirhead

himself, would regard that as the sole, or even the main, object

of philosophy. As Professor Muirhead continues to lend the

distinction of his name to the Library of Philosophy it seemed

not inappropriate to allow him to recall us to these aims in his

own words. The emphasis on the history of thought also seemed to

me very timely; and the number of important works promised for

the Library in the very near future augur well for the continued

fulfilment, in this and other ways, of the expectations of the

original editor.

This book has grown out of an attempt to harmonize two different

tendencies, one in psychology, the other in physics, with both of

which I find myself in sympathy, although at first sight they

might seem inconsistent. On the one hand, many psychologists,

especially those of the behaviourist school, tend to adopt what

is essentially a materialistic position, as a matter of method if

not of metaphysics. They make psychology increasingly dependent

on physiology and external observation, and tend to think of

matter as something much more solid and indubitable than mind.

Meanwhile the physicists, especially Einstein and other exponents

much may be taken as fact, and as a datum for our inquiry. But as

soon as we try to say what exactly the difference is, we become

involved in perplexities. Is “consciousness” ultimate and simple,

something to be merely accepted and contemplated? Or is it

something complex, perhaps consisting in our way of behaving in

the presence of objects, or, alternatively, in the existence in

us of things called “ideas,” having a certain relation to

objects, though different from them, and only symbolically

representative of them? Such questions are not easy to answer;

but until they are answered we cannot profess to know what we

mean by saying that we are possessed of “consciousness.”

 Before considering modern theories, let us look first at

consciousness from the standpoint of conventional psychology,

since this embodies views which naturally occur when we begin to

reflect upon the subject. For this purpose, let us as a

preliminary consider different ways of being conscious.

 

First, there is the way of PERCEPTION. We “perceive” tables and

chairs, horses and dogs, our friends, traffic passing in the

street—in short, anything which we recognize through the senses.

I leave on one side for the present the question whether pure

sensation is to be regarded as a form of consciousness: what I am

speaking of now is perception, where, according to conventional

psychology, we go beyond the sensation to the “thing” which it

represents. When you hear a donkey bray, you not only hear a

noise, but realize that it comes from a donkey. When you see a

table, you not only see a coloured surface, but realize that it

is hard. The addition of these elements that go beyond crude

sensation is said to constitute perception. We shall have more to

say about this at a later stage. For the moment, I am merely

concerned to note that perception of objects is one of the most

obvious examples of what is called “consciousness.” We are

“conscious” of anything that we perceive.

“conscious” of anything that we perceive.

 

We may take next the way of MEMORY. If I set to work to recall

what I did this morning, that is a form of consciousness

different from perception, since it is concerned with the past.

There are various problems as to how we can be conscious now of

what no longer exists. These will be dealt with incidentally when

we come to the analysis of memory.

 

From memory it is an easy step to what are called “ideas”—not in

the Platonic sense, but in that of Locke, Berkeley and Hume, in

which they are opposed to “impressions.” You may be conscious of

a friend either by seeing him or by “thinking” of him; and by

“thought” you can be conscious of objects which cannot be seen,

such as the human race, or physiology. “Thought” in the narrower

sense is that form of consciousness which consists in “ideas” as

opposed to impressions or mere memories.

 

We may end our preliminary catalogue with BELIEF, by which I mean

that way of being conscious which may be either true or false. We

say that a man is “conscious of looking a fool,” by which we mean

that he believes he looks a fool, and is not mistaken in this

belief. This is a different form of consciousness from any of the

which they are opposed to “impressions.” You may be conscious of

a friend either by seeing him or by “thinking” of him; and by

“thought” you can be conscious of objects which cannot be seen,

such as the human race, or physiology. “Thought” in the narrower

sense is that form of consciousness which consists in “ideas” as

opposed to impressions or mere memories.

 

We may end our preliminary catalogue with BELIEF, by which I mean

that way of being conscious which may be either true or false. We

say that a man is “conscious of looking a fool,” by which we mean

that he believes he looks a fool, and is not mistaken in this

belief. This is a different form of consciousness from any of the

belief. This is a different form of consciousness from any of the

earlier ones. It is the form which gives “knowledge” in the

strict sense, and also error. It is, at least apparently, more

complex than our previous forms of consciousness; though we shall

find that they are not so separable from it as they might appear

to be.

 

Besides ways of being conscious there are other things that would

ordinarily be called “mental,” such as desire and pleasure and

pain. These raise problems of their own, which we shall reach in

Lecture III. But the hardest problems are those that arise

concerning ways of being “conscious.” These ways, taken together,

are called the “cognitive” elements in mind, and it is these that

will occupy us most during the following lectures.

 

There is one element which SEEMS obviously in common among the

different ways of being conscious, and that is, that they are all

directed to OBJECTS. We are conscious “of” something. The

consciousness, it seems, is one thing, and that of which we are

conscious is another thing. Unless we are to acquiesce in the

view that we can never be conscious of anything outside our own

minds, we must say that the object of consciousness need not be

mental, though the consciousness must be. (I am speaking within

the circle of conventional doctrines, not expressing my own

beliefs.) This direction towards an object is commonly regarded

as typical of every form of cognition, and sometimes of mental

life altogether. We may distinguish two different tendencies in

traditional psychology. There are those who take mental phenomena

naively, just as they would physical phenomena. This school of

psychologists tends not to emphasize the object. On the other

hand, there are those whose primary interest is in the apparent

fact that we have KNOWLEDGE, that there is a world surrounding us

of which we are aware. These men are interested in the mind

because of its relation to the world, because knowledge, if it

mistaken, is very useful as affording a schema in terms of which

other theories can be stated. In the remainder of the present

lecture I shall state in outline the view which I advocate, and

show how various other views out of which mine has grown result

from modifications of the threefold analysis into act, content

and object.

 

The first criticism I have to make is that the ACT seems

unnecessary and fictitious. The occurrence of the content of a

thought constitutes the occurrence of the thought. Empirically, I

cannot discover anything corresponding to the supposed act; and

theoretically I cannot see that it is indispensable. We say: “I

think so-and-so,” and this word “I” suggests that thinking is the

act of a person. Meinong’s “act” is the ghost of the subject, or

what once was the full-blooded soul. It is supposed that thoughts

cannot just come and go, but need a person to think them. Now, of

course it is true that thoughts can be collected into bundles, so

that one bundle is my thoughts, another is your thoughts, and a

third is the thoughts of Mr. Jones. But I think the person is not

an ingredient in the single thought: he is rather constituted by

relations of the thoughts to each other and to the body. This is

a large question, which need not, in its entirety, concern us at

present. All that I am concerned with for the moment is that the

present. All that I am concerned with for the moment is that the

grammatical forms “I think,” “you think,” and “Mr. Jones thinks,”

are misleading if regarded as indicating an analysis of a single

thought. It would be better to say “it thinks in me,” like “it

rains here”; or better still, “there is a thought in me.” This is

simply on the ground that what Meinong calls the act in thinking

is not empirically discoverable, or logically deducible from what

we can observe.

 

The next point of criticism concerns the relation of content and

object. The reference of thoughts to objects is not, I believe,

the simple direct essential thing that Brentano and Meinong

the simple direct essential thing that Brentano and Meinong

represent it as being. It seems to me to be derivative, and to

consist largely in BELIEFS: beliefs that what constitutes the

thought is connected with various other elements which together

make up the object. You have, say, an image of St. Paul’s, or

merely the word “St. Paul’s” in your head. You believe, however

vaguely and dimly, that this is connected with what you would see

if you went to St. Paul’s, or what you would feel if you touched

its walls; it is further connected with what other people see and

feel, with services and the Dean and Chapter and Sir Christopher

Wren. These things are not mere thoughts of yours, but your

thought stands in a relation to them of which you are more or

thought stands in a relation to them of which you are more or

less aware. The awareness of this relation is a further thought,

and constitutes your feeling that the original thought had an

“object.” But in pure imagination you can get very similar

thoughts without these accompanying beliefs; and in this case

your thoughts do not have objects or seem to have them. Thus in

such instances you have content without object. On the other

hand, in seeing or hearing it would be less misleading to say

that you have object without content, since what you see or hear

is actually part of the physical world, though not matter in the

sense of physics. Thus the whole question of the relation of

mental occurrences to objects grows very complicated, and cannot

mental occurrences to objects grows very complicated, and cannot

be settled by regarding reference to objects as of the essence of

thoughts. All the above remarks are merely preliminary, and will

be expanded later.

 

Speaking in popular and unphilosophical terms, we may say that

the content of a thought is supposed to be something in your head

when you think the thought, while the object is usually something

in the outer world. It is held that knowledge of the outer world

is constituted by the relation to the object, while the fact that

knowledge is different from what it knows is due to the fact that

knowledge comes by way of contents. We can begin to state the

difference between realism and idealism in terms of this

opposition of contents and objects. Speaking quite roughly and

approximately, we may say that idealism tends to suppress the

object, while realism tends to suppress the content. Idealism,

accordingly, says that nothing can be known except thoughts, and

all the reality that we know is mental; while realism maintains

that we know objects directly, in sensation certainly, and

perhaps also in memory and thought. Idealism does not say that

nothing can be known beyond the present thought, but it maintains

that the context of vague belief, which we spoke of in connection

with the thought of St. Paul’s, only takes you to other thoughts,

never to anything radically different from thoughts. The

difficulty of this view is in regard to sensation, where it seems

as if we came into direct contact with the outer world. But the

Berkeleian way of meeting this difficulty is so familiar that I

need not enlarge upon it now. I shall return to it in a later

lecture, and will only observe, for the present, that there seem

to me no valid grounds for regarding what we see and hear as not

part of the physical world.

 

Realists, on the other hand, as a rule, suppress the content, and

maintain that a thought consists either of act and object alone,

maintain that a thought consists either of act and object alone,

or of object alone. I have been in the past a realist, and I

remain a realist as regards sensation, but not as regards memory

or thought. I will try to explain what seem to me to be the

reasons for and against various kinds of realism.

 

Modern idealism professes to be by no means confined to the

present thought or the present thinker in regard to its

knowledge; indeed, it contends that the world is so organic, so

dove-tailed, that from any one portion the whole can be inferred,

as the complete skeleton of an extinct animal can be inferred

from one bone. But the logic by which this supposed organic

nature of the world is nominally demonstrated appears to

realists, as it does to me, to be faulty. They argue that, if we

cannot know the physical world directly, we cannot really know

any thing outside our own minds: the rest of the world may be

merely our dream. This is a dreary view, and they there fore seek

ways of escaping from it. Accordingly they maintain that in

knowledge we are in direct contact with objects, which may be,

and usually are, outside our own minds. No doubt they are

prompted to this view, in the first place, by bias, namely, by

the desire to think that they can know of the existence of a

world outside themselves. But we have to consider, not what led

them to desire the view, but whether their arguments for it are

valid.

 

There are two different kinds of realism, according as we make a

thought consist of act and object, or of object alone. Their

difficulties are different, but neither seems tenable all

through. Take, for the sake of definiteness, the remembering of a

past event. The remembering occurs now, and is therefore

necessarily not identical with the past event. So long as we

retain the act, this need cause no difficulty. The act of

remembering occurs now, and has on this view a certain essential

relation to the past event which it remembers. There is no

LOGICAL objection to this theory, but there is the objection,

which we spoke of earlier, that the act seems mythical, and is

not to be found by observation. If, on the other hand, we try to

constitute memory without the act, we are driven to a content,

since we must have something that happens NOW, as opposed to the

event which happened in the past. Thus, when we reject the act,

which I think we must, we are driven to a theory of memory which

is more akin to idealism. These arguments, however, do not apply

to sensation. It is especially sensation, I think, which is

considered by those realists who retain only the object.
