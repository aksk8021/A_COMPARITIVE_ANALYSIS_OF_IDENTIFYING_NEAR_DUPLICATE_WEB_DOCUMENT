Giovanni Stuart Mill was born in London in 1806. His father, Giacomo Mill, historian and economist of some value, a pupil of Bentham and a close friend of Ricardo, subjected his promising genius to a system of education which developed his strength: still young, Stuart Mill knew perfectly Latin, Greek, history, especially ancient: after a few months spent in France in 1820, he returned to his homeland, studied philosophy and law, and obtained, under the dependence of his father, a placed in the administrative offices of the Company of the Indies, which he held from 1823 to 1858. He was, for some years, a member of the House of Commons, sent there by the electors of Westminster. Having retired in recent years to Avignon in France, he died there in 1873.

Stuart Mill's ingenuity was expressed in the most varied forms: he wrote about philosophy, first following and modifying the utilitarianism of Geremia Bentham, then undergoing the influence of the positivism of Augusto Comte, with whom he was in correspondence and friendship; he published a System of Logic ; he ardently patronized those land reforms of Ireland, which were already being felt the need.

But the greatest title of glory to which his name is linked are, without doubt, his writings on political economy and public law. A follower, in economics, of the classical school, such as Adamo Smith, Malthus, Ricardo had established in England, he nevertheless dealt with love for worker questions, accepting and developing purely modern ideas in this regard; with his works on Representative Government , on the Subjection of Women and with this essay of which we present a translation to the Italian reader, he took his place among the first publicists in Europe.

He advocated the representation of minorities; he was an intelligent and passionate apostle of that complex [4]of reforms that are understood under the name of "Women's emancipation": above all, with this work on Freedom , he placed himself in a decisive fighting position against those tendencies to broaden the functions of social power, which, inevitably brought about new times and of new conditions, they must, on the other hand, be vigorously restrained in their excessive and tyrannical aspects.

This book appeared for the first time in London in 1859. Yet, it has not aged, it has not lost interest or flavor of topicality; on the contrary, the judgment of the time has given to the ideas that have developed there such an undisputed reason that their importance and authority has greatly increased.

I did not think it right to introduce such a critical preface to the book. In front of a mind like that of Stuart Mill, in front of a work like this, a judgment would be easily rash: it is good for the reader to form it himself, according to his beliefs and his tendencies.

What is certain is that, if the book obtained in Italy that success and that diffusion that unfortunately does not deserve the poor appearance that I have been able to give it, it could do some good. The clear, calm, serene demonstration that freedom is not only an abstract theoretical right, but also an indispensable condition of solid civil progress, could contribute to spreading in our country that sense of freedom which, on so many occasions, is sadly ascertained. 'absence. I dare to recommend in a special way to those who blindly follow the impulse of certain prejudices and certain fears, that little masterpiece which is the second chapter, on freedom of thought and speech.

If, in any case, the intent to clear some false opinion from the minds, to teach someone a little tolerance in matters of religion and politics, were, even in a small part, achieved, I would be exuberantly compensated for my modest work.

I dedicate this volume to the dear and tearful memory of she who was the inspirer, and partly the author, of the best in my works: to the memory of her friend and wife, whose fervent sense of true and righteous was my keenest encouragement - the approval of which was my highest reward.

Like everything I have written for many years, this volume is as much your work as mine, but the book, as it now presents itself, has enjoyed the inestimable advantage of being revised by you only to a very insufficient degree. of the most important parts was reserved for a second and more accurate examination, which by now is never destined to receive again.

If I knew how to interpret only half of the great thoughts, of the noble sentiments that are buried with it, the world would reap a far greater fruit than from all that I can write, without the inspiration and assistance of its incomparable wisdom.

FREEDOM

CHAPTER ONE.
INTRODUCTION.
The subject of this work is not the so-called free will so unhappily opposed to what is badly called the doctrine of philosophical necessity, but rather social or civil freedom, that is, the nature and limits of the power that Society can legitimately exercise over the individual. : a question that is rarely posed and perhaps never discussed in general terms, but which with its inadvertent presence has a profound influence on the practical controversies of the century and will probably soon be recognized as the vital question of the future. This question is so far from being new that, in a certain sense, it has divided humanity, almost from the earliest times. But it presents itself in new forms in the age of progress into which the more civilized groups of the human species have now entered,

The struggle between freedom and authority is the characteristic note of those historical periods which at first become familiar to us in Greek, Roman and English histories. But, in other times, the struggle was between the subjects, or some class of subjects, and the government: by freedom, we meant protection against the tyranny of political rulers. These (except in some democratic cities of Greece) seemed necessarily in an enemy position to the people they governed. In other times the government was generally held by a man or a tribe or [8]from a caste which derived its authority from the right of conquest or succession, - in no case from the consent of the governed - and of which men did not dare, perhaps even did not wish to question the supremacy, even taking some precautions against the oppressive exercise of it. The power of the rulers was then considered as necessary, but also as highly dangerous: as a weapon that they would try to use both against their subjects and against external enemies. In order to prevent the weakest members of the community from being devoured by innumerable birds, it was indispensable that a bird of prey stronger than the others was in charge of restraining these voracious animals; but since the king of the vultures would have been no less willing to devour the flock than any of the lesser harpies,

For this reason, the aim of the patriots was to assign limits to the power that the rulers had to exercise over the community: this they meant by freedom. It was aimed in two ways: first of all, by obtaining the recognition of certain immunities, called liberties or political rights, which, according to the general opinion, the government could not violate with impunity without failing to speak and without running, with good reason. the risk of a particular resistance or a general rebellion. Another expedient, more recent in general, was the establishment of constitutional restraints, by means of which the consent of the community or of any body, supposed to represent the interests of this, was a necessary condition of any of the important acts of government. In most countries of Europe, the government has been forced, more or less, to submit to the first of these restrictions. It was not the same for the second; and to be able to reach it, or, when it was already possessed to a certain point, to reach it more completely, became everywhere the principal aim of the friends of freedom. And as long as humanity contented itself with fighting one enemy with another, and being ruled by a master, on condition of being more or less effectively guaranteed against his tyranny, the wishes of the liberals did not rise higher. Yet, in the path of human affairs, there came a time when men ceased to regard it as naturally necessary that their rulers should constitute an independent power, of an interest opposite to theirs. It seemed to them much better that the various state magistrates were their representatives or delegates, revocable at their convenience. It seemed that only in this way could humanity have complete assurance that it would never, to its detriment, abuse the powers of the government. A little [9]gradually this new need for elective and temporary rulers became the main object of popular party unrest, wherever there was one, and earlier efforts to limit the power of rulers were abandoned almost everywhere. Since in this struggle it was a question of making the power of government emanate from the periodic choice of the governed, some began to believe that too much importance had been attached to the idea of ​​limiting power itself. This (it seemed) was an advantage against those rulers whose interests were usually opposed to those of the people; but what was needed then was that the rulers be one with the people, that their interest and their will be the interest and the will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against her own will: there was no fear of her tyrannizing herself. And since the rulers of a nation were effectively accountable to it, readily revocable when it pleased, they could well be entrusted with a power which the nation itself had the means of prescribing the use. Their power was but the power of the nation itself, concentrated and put into a convenient form to be exercised. This way of thinking or perhaps rather of feeling was common in the last generation of European liberals, among whom it still prevails on the continent. Those which place some limits on what a government can do, except in the case of such governments which, according to them, should not exist, are, among the thinkers of the continent, fingerprinted as brilliant exceptions.

But in political and philosophical theories, as in people, success reveals flaws and weaknesses that failure could have hidden. The idea that peoples do not need to limit their power over themselves might have seemed axiomatic when popular government was a thing that was limited to dreaming of its existence or reading it in history, in some very remote epoch.

This concept was not necessarily disturbed by transitory aberrations, such as those of the French Revolution, the worst of which were the work of a usurping minority and which, in any case, did not represent the permanent action of popular institutions, but a sudden and convulsive explosion against monarchical and aristocratic despotism. Meanwhile, in due time, a democratic republic came to occupy a large area of ​​the earth and became one of the most powerful parts of the community of nations. From then on, elective and responsible government became the object of those observations and of [10]those criticisms that point to any great fact that exists. It was then realized that certain phrases, such as "power over oneself" and "the power of peoples over themselves," did not express the true state of things; the people who exercise power are not always the same people over whom it is exercised, and the self-government of which we speak is not the government of each one held by himself, but of each one held by all the others. Furthermore, the will of the people practically means the will of the most numerous and active part of the people - of the majority, in short, or of those who manage to pass themselves off as such. Consequently, the people may wish to oppress a part of themselves, and precautions are just as useful in this respect as against any other abuse of power. For these reasons it is always important to limit the power of the government over the individual, even when the rulers are regularly accountable to the community, or to the party that prevails in the community. This way of highlighting the argument did not last long to gain acceptance: it is equally recommended to the intelligence of thinkers and to the tendencies of those notable classes of European society who consider democracy as hostile to their interests. So now, in political speculations, the tyranny of the majority is placed among the evils against which society must guard itself. The argument did not last long to be accepted: it is equally recommended to the intelligence of thinkers and to the tendencies of those notable classes of European society who consider democracy as hostile to their interests.

So now, in political speculations, the tyranny of the majority is placed among the evils against which society must guard itself.

Like the other tyrannies, that of the majority was at first and is still vulgarly feared, especially as it acts through the acts of public authority. But every careful observer has noticed that, when society is itself the tyrant - society collectively, with respect to the individual individuals that compose it - its means of tyrannizing are not restricted to the acts it commands its political officials. The society can, and it carries out itself, its own decrees; and, if it emanates from evil, or emanates from it about things it should not enter, it exercises a social tyranny more formidable than any legal oppression: in reality, if such a tyranny does not have equally severe penalties, it nevertheless leaves less means of escaping it;

For this reason, protection against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough. Since society has the tendency: 1.º to impose as rules of conduct, with means that do not enter into civil penalties, its ideas and customs on those who break away from them - 2.º to prevent development and, as far as possible, the formation of any marked individuality - 3.º of forcing all characters to model themselves on his own - the individual has the right to be [11]protected against all of this. There is a limit to the legitimate action of collective opinion on individual independence: finding this limit and defending it against any usurpation is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs as protecting us against political despotism.

But, if this proposition is not contestable in general terms, the practical question of where the limit should be placed, of how individual freedom and social surveillance should be brought together, is a subject on which almost everything still needs to be done. . Everything that gives some value to our existence depends on the coercion imposed on the actions of others: therefore some rules of conduct must be imposed by law first of all, and then by opinion, for those many things on which the law cannot exercise an influence. action.

What should these rules be? Such is the fundamental question in human affairs; but, with the exception of some of the most important cases, it is also the one for which the least progress has been made.

There are not two centuries, nor, almost, two countries that have reached the same conclusion on this; and the conclusion of a century or a country is a subject of astonishment to another. However, the men of each century or each country do not find the question more complicated than if it were a subject on which the human species has always been in agreement. The rules that predominate among them seem evident and have their own justification: this almost universal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence of habit, which not only, as the saying goes, is second nature, but it is continually exchanged with nature itself. The effect of habit, preventing any doubts from rising about the rules of conduct imposed by humanity on each, it is all the more complete in that, on this subject, it is generally not considered as necessary to be able to give reasons either to others or to oneself: one is accustomed to believe (and some who aspire to the title of philosophers encourage us in this opinion ) that our feelings about subjects of this nature are worth better than reasons and render these useless. The practical principle which guides us in our views on how to regulate human conduct is the idea, in the spirit of each, that others should be compelled to act as he wishes and those with whom he likes. In fact, no one confesses that the regulator of his judgment is his own whim; yet an opinion on a point of conduct, which is not supported by reasons, can only be considered as a person's tendency; [12]people obey, and still the inclination of many instead of being that of one. For an ordinary man, however, his inclination, thus sustained, is not only a fully satisfactory reason, but the only one from which all the notions of morality, of taste, of conveniences derive, which his religious faith does not already include: it is also his main guide in the interpretation of this.

Consequently, men's views on what is laudable or blameworthy are influenced by all the different causes which affect their desires regarding the conduct of others, causes as numerous as those that determine their desires on any other subject. Sometimes it is their reason; some others are their prejudices or superstitions; often their social feelings, and often their antisocial tendencies, envy or jealousy, contempt or foolishness. But more often than not the man is guided by his interest in him, legitimate or illegitimate. Wherever there is a ruling class, almost all public morality derives from the interests of this class and its feelings of superiority. Morality between Spartans and Helots, between cultivators and niggers on the plantations, between princes and subjects, between nobles and plebeians, between men and women, it was almost everywhere the creation of class interests and feelings: and the opinions thus generated react in turn on the moral feelings of the members of the ruling class, in their mutual relations . On the other hand, wherever a formerly dominant class has lost its influence, or even wherever this influence is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments bear the mark of an impatient rebellion against authority. Another principle, which determined the rules of conduct imposed, both by law and by opinion, was the servility of the human species with regard to the preferences or supposed aversions of its earthly lords or its deities. This servility, although essentially selfish, does not arise from hypocrisy, and arouses perfectly sincere feelings of horror; it has made men capable of burning sorcerers and heretics.

Amidst so many lower influences, the evident and general interests of society have naturally played a part, and an important one, in the direction of moral sentiments: however less because of their own value than as a consequence of the likes or dislikes produced by these interests. Subsequently they made themselves felt with equal vigor in establishing the moral principles of the likes or dislikes which had nothing or almost nothing to do with the interests of society.

Thus the whim or disgust of society or some powerful part of society is the main determinant, [13]in practice, the rules imposed on general observance under the sanction of law or opinion.

Generally, those who were, in terms of ideas and sentiments, more advanced than society, have allowed such a state of affairs to be kept, as a principle, intact, however much they may have fought against any of its particulars; they took care to know what society should prefer or not to prefer, rather than to know whether what it preferred or did not prefer should be imposed on individuals; they proposed to change the sentiments of the human species on some special point in which they themselves were guilty of heresy, rather than making, with all heretics in general, a common cause for the defense of freedom. No one has consciously risen higher; and no one has remained firmly there except in matters of religion: a case that, in many respects, contains teachings, above all because it offers an example,odium theologicum, in a sincere bigot, it is one of the surest cases of moral sentiment. Those who first shook the yoke of what was called the universal Church were generally as willing to tolerate differences of religious opinion as that Church itself. But, when the heat of the struggle was cooled without giving complete victory to any party, when each church or sect had to limit its hopes to retain possession of the occupied land, the minorities, seeing that they were not likely to change into majorities, they were forced to support free religious dissidence in comparison with those who could not convert. Consequently, it is almost only on this battlefield that the rights of the individual against society have been asserted on the basis of well established principles, and that the right of society to have its authority weighed on dissidents was openly contested. The great writers to whom the world owes what it possesses of religious freedom have claimed freedom of conscience as an inalienable right, and have absolutely denied that a human being should be accountable to others for his religious faith. However, intolerance for everything that really cares about it is so natural to the human species that religious freedom was practically nowhere implemented, except where indifference, which does not like to be disturbed in its peace by theological disputes, he made his weight felt on the scales. he possesses religious freedom have claimed freedom of conscience as an inalienable right, and have absolutely denied that a human being should be accountable to others for his or her religious faith.

However, intolerance for everything that really cares about it is so natural to the human species that religious freedom was practically nowhere implemented, except where indifference, which does not like to be disturbed in its peace by theological disputes, he made his weight felt on the scales.

In the spirit of almost all people of faith, even in the most tolerant countries, the law is not admitted without tacit reservations. A person will let dissidents say in matters of ecclesiastical government, but not in matters of dogma; another can tolerate anyone, but not a papist or a unitarian; a third, all those who believe in revealed religion; [14]a small number goes further in his charity, but stops at the belief in a God and in the future life. Wherever the sentiment of the majority is still sincere and intense, one realizes that it has not at all given up on its claims to be obeyed.

In England (owing to the special contingencies of our political history) although the yoke of opinion is perhaps more severe, that of the law is lighter than in most countries of Europe, and there is a great aversion to any direct intervention of the both legislative and executive power in private conduct; this much less because of a just respect for the rights of the individual than because of the old habit of considering the government as representing an interest opposite to that of the public. The majority has not yet learned to regard the power of the government as its power, and the views of the government as its own: and when it comes to this, individual freedom will probably be in danger of being violated by the government as much as it already is. now from public opinion.

But, for the moment, there is a great force of feeling ready to rise up against any attempt by the law to watch over individuals, in things which hitherto did not belong to him: and this without any discernment of what is or is not in the legitimate sphere of official supervision; so that such a sentiment, so highly salutary in itself, is applied as often wrongly as rightly. In fact, there is no recognized principle for establishing in a practical way the legitimacy or illegality of government intervention: it is decided according to personal tendencies. Some, wherever they see good to be done or evil to be repaired, would like to push the government to take on the enterprise, while the others prefer to endure all sorts of social abuses rather than add anything to the powers of the government. Men take sides, in each particular case, in these or in those rows, following either the general direction of their feelings, or the degree of interest they take in the thing which it proposes to make the government do, or even the conviction that the government will or will not be able to do it the way they like. But they very seldom act according to a thoughtful and firm opinion about the things that naturally must be done by the government. And therefore it seems to me that today, as a consequence of this lack of rule or principle, one party is just as often wrong as the other; government intervention is wrongly invoked as often as wrongly convicted.

The purpose of this essay is to proclaim a very simple principle, which must absolutely inform the conduct of society towards the individual, in all that is constraint. [15]and surveillance - be it the means used or physical force, in the form of legal punishments, or the moral coercion of public opinion. Here is such a principle: the only end that allows men, individually or collectively, to disturb the freedom of action of any of their fellow men, is the protection of oneself; the only legitimate reason that a community can have for using force against one of its members is to prevent him from harming others: but the good, both physical and moral, of this individual is not sufficient reason.

A man cannot, strictly speaking, be forced to do or omit an action, because that would be better for him, or would make him happier, or because, in the opinion of others, he would do something wise or even just. All these are good reasons to make observations to him, to argue with him, to persuade him or to plead with him, but not to coerce him or to cause him any harm, if he does not care. To justify this, it would be necessary that the conduct from which one wishes to divert this man had the effect of harming someone else: the only part of the conduct of an individual, over which society has jurisdiction, is that which concerns others: for what interests him alone, his independence is, by right, absolute; on himself, on his body and on his spirit, the individual is sovereign.

This doctrine - perhaps it is scarcely necessary to mention it - is intended only to be applied to human beings in the maturation of their faculties. We do not speak of boys or adolescents of both sexes who have not reached, according to the law, the age of majority: those who are still of an age that requires the care of others, must be protected against their own actions as well as against. any external danger. For the same reason, we can leave aside those nascent societies in which the race itself can be regarded as a minor: the first difficulties on the road to spontaneous progress are so great that one seldom has the choice of means of overcoming them. Thus, any sovereign animated by a progressive spirit can well use all means to achieve a goal, which otherwise, perhaps, it would escape him forever. Despotism is a legitimate way of governing when dealing with barbarians, as long as the aim is their improvement and the means are justified in achieving it. Freedom, as a principle, cannot be applied to a state of affairs prior to the moment in which the human species becomes capable of improving itself with a fair and free discussion: until then, it can only hope in blind obedience to an Akbar or to a Charlemagne, if he is lucky enough to find any. But since mankind is capable of progressing by means of conviction or persuasion (a degree which for a long time it cannot be applied to a state of affairs prior to the moment in which the human species becomes capable of improving itself with a fair and free discussion: until then, it can only hope in blind obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if it has lucky enough to find some. But since mankind is capable of progressing by means of conviction or persuasion (a degree which for a long time it cannot be applied to a state of affairs prior to the moment in which the human species becomes capable of improving itself with a fair and free discussion: until then, it can only hope in blind obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if it has the good fortune to find some. But since mankind is capable of progressing by means of conviction or persuasion (a degree which for a long time [16]have reached all the nations with which we must deal here) the coercion, either in the direct form, or under that of penalty for non-observance, is no longer admissible as a means of doing good to men; it is still justifiable only for their mutual security.

It should be premised: I neglect any advantage that may come to my argument from the idea of ​​abstract law as a thing independent of the useful: utility is, in my sense, the supreme solution of any moral question; but it must be utility in the broadest sense of the word, utility founded on the permanent advantages of man, considered as a progressive being.

These interests, I argue, do not justify the submission of individual spontaneity to external surveillance except for those actions of each that affect the interests of others. If a man commits an act harmful to others, there is evidently reason to punish him with the law, or, if the legal penalties are not certainly applicable, with general disapproval. There are also many positive acts advantageous to others, which a man may be rightly obliged to perform: for example, to act as a witness in court or to do all one's duty, whether in common defense or in any common work necessary for society under the law. protection from which he lives. Furthermore, one can, strictly speaking, hold him accountable to society if he does not perform certain acts of individual charity which are, under given circumstances, the obvious duty of every man; such as saving the life of one's fellow man or intervening to defend the weak from mistreatment. A person can harm others not only by his actions, but by his inaction; and, in any case, it is responsible towards them for the damage.

It is true that, in the latter case, the coercion must be exercised with much greater regard than in the former. To hold someone responsible for the harm he does to others: this is the rule; holding him responsible for the evil from which he does not insure them: here, comparatively speaking, is the exception. However, there are many cases that are clear enough and serious enough to warrant this exception. In all that concerns the external relations of the individual, he is ipso jure responsible to those whose interests are at stake, and, if necessary, to society as their protector. There are often good reasons not to impose this responsibility on men; but these reasons must derive from the particular advantages of the case, both because it is a case in which, all things considered, the the individual will probably act better left to his own impulse than under any surveillance of society; and because an attempt at surveillance would produce greater evils than it does [17]they want to avoid. When such reasons obstruct forced responsibility, the conscience of the same agent must take the place of the absent judge, to protect those interests of others who lack external protection, and the man must judge himself all the more severely since the case does not he submits to the judgment of his fellow men.
