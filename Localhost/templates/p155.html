The translation of these letters came about at a time when physical illness made it impossible for me to work independently as a scholar. I read and translated initially for my own entertainment and practice; but the more powerfully these documents of love and spiritual intercourse between two such generous people attracted me, the more vividly I wished to make them accessible to others as well. Our church-historical literature contains so many noble treasures that stand forgotten in the libraries, stored away in a dusty husk—so many a written monument that speaks in its foreign language only to scholars, while it has been brought to light and made understandable to offer pleasure and edification to many a more serious reader could.

The letters that have come down to us from Abelard and Heloise are little known, at least in Germany, although the two belong to those lovers of world-historical reputation whose names are inextricably linked, like Hero and Leander, Tristan and Isolde , Dante and Beatrice. Abroad, on the other hand, and especially in France, attention was paid to these letters early on, and the actual love letters in particular were variously edited poetically and embellished like novels — but not to their advantage: compare the edits made to this subject by a Pope and Colardeau — by us a perfectly formed poetic translation of Bürger introduced - have become part, with our original, and one will easily become aware of how much nobler and,

A very elegant French translation of the letters, mostly true to the text, is given by O. Gréard in his book: “ Lettres complètes d'Abélard et d'Heloise, Paris, Garnier Frères ”. The French translation is accompanied by the Latin text in Viktor Cousin's review, which is also the basis of our translation.

In 1844 a German translation of the correspondence was published by Moriz Carrière , [1]and this work would make my translation superfluous if it were still available in bookshops at all. However, since it is completely out of print - I only saw it after a long struggle - and there is no prospect of a new edition, I felt entitled to this new publication. — Carrière prefaces his translation with a lengthy introduction that is as scholarly as it is witty, in which he presents Abelard's philosophical and theological point of view with the fire of noble enthusiasm. This introduction makes up almost a third of the whole book, so that it is actually the intellectual focus of the book. I, for my part, limit myself in this brief introduction to

The collection of letters published here comprises a total of twelve letters. The first letter includes the document known as the "Story of Suffering" ( historia calamitatum ), which, in the form of a letter addressed to an unknown friend of Abelard's, describes the eventful life of the latter up to the time when he the great quarrel with Bernard of Clairvaux occurs — that is, a piece of autobiography that forms the introduction to the following correspondence.

In general, this letter was the cause of all the correspondence that followed: it had been more than a decade since the separation of the lovers had passed away, and during all this time, to all appearances, all intercourse between them had ceased. Then, by chance, Abelard's letter came into Heloisen's hands and aroused "an inexpressibly painful feeling in the old wound". The story of the sufferings of the beloved man, among which he quite rightly counted his love, fans the spark that still smolders in her heart to a bright flame, and she relives all the joys and all the sorrows of one in the memory high love. Letters II and IV were written out of the high tide of these newly awakened feelings: an unparalleled confession, a heartfelt outcry in the most immediate, passionate, boldest tones that have ever passed a woman's lips. In comparison with these outpourings, Abelard's replies have always been found remarkably calm and cool. In fact, in his letters (III and V) he resembles the rigid cliff that remains motionless and unfeeling in the midst of the waves' ever-repeated attempts to embrace it. Because of this coldness, serious moral reproaches were made to him, and general philosophical observations about how differently the two sexes love were linked to his behavior. Especially Johannes Scherr in his witty and extreme way (Human Tragedy, Vol. 2, "Heloise"). The way in which Abelard seeks to feed Heloisen's hungry heart, in the way he now speaks entirely in the language of the clergyman, of the oracular saint and prophet, to the woman with whom he had once dealt so little spiritually, makes an embarrassing, unpleasant impression at first glance, and in places even has something outrageous about it. But the tone he strikes is not an assumed mask; what he writes to Heloise are not just pious phrases, but he is bitterly serious; he is truly converted, he repents, and from this point of view regards his and Heloise's external misfortune as a gracious dispensation of God for the salvation of their souls. Then, of course, the feeling that had just awakened in new flames in Helois's heart died out completely in him. He makes no secret of it; he does not look for the once beloved over it but he is bitterly serious; he is truly converted, he repents, and from this point of view regards his and Heloise's external misfortune as a gracious dispensation of God for the salvation of their souls. Then, of course, the feeling that had just awakened in new flames in Helois's heart died out completely in him. He makes no secret of it; he does not look for the once beloved over it but he is bitterly serious; he is truly converted, he repents, and from this point of view regards his and Heloise's external misfortune as a gracious dispensation of God for the salvation of their souls. Then, of course, the feeling that had just awakened in new flames in Helois's heart died out completely in him. He makes no secret of it; he does not look for the once beloved over it to hide His truthfulness is his excuse. But where a love has died out, nobody will expect glowing love letters.

However, one would not expect such a thing, if one considers the difference in the path of life and the further destinies of those who were once connected in love. Heloise once entered a convent against her will and against her nature, only out of obedience to the man she loved. She had made a sacrifice that her nature was not up to. In any case, she had not found peace behind the monastery walls. It is true that her mental and moral energy brought her to a reputation of eminent holiness, but read her shattering self-accusations in the Fourth Epistle to gain a glimpse of that restless, unsatisfied heart. From such a state of mind those passionate outpourings are understandable, in comparison to Abelard's omissions and father confessor's admonitions, of course, seem cold. It should also be considered that Heloisen's life was actually over when she entered the monastery; The convent lady no longer expected new powerful impressions that would have blurred the old ones. She drew on a short past. But what she brought back from memories of the world, from impressions of life, all of that was contained in the name Abelard. This name, her one and only, lived in her heart and with it love, and so all it took was a spark to kindle the sunk embers again. Abelard, on the other hand, had been thrown out of the peaceful port of the monastery, to which he too had fled, several times on the high waves of life and business in this world. In his profession, which certainly involved great excitement and hateful persecutions, but also brilliant triumphs, found a certain inner stability and satisfaction. In any case, his life was so rich in shattering new impressions and gripping experiences that that one memory of his love, that experience with Heloise, had to fade before it. He feels at all at the time our letters were written, a hunted wild animal threatened on all sides. He asks Heloise and her nuns for their special intercession in prayer; he is a tired man, has thoughts of death and wants to be buried in the “Paraclete”, the monastery he conceded to Heloises. You will find it understandable that in this mood he wrote different letters from Heloise. To give him credit, he may be reproached for once being the victim of a secret marriage (although that was still better than the wild marriages then common among clerics)—and the still greater victim of the monastic vows of Heloise accepted. —

It is not without emotion that one reads how Heloise is now in the sixth Letter seeks to subdue the voice of the heart, which had not been able to awaken an echo in Abelard - "although there is nothing in our power so little as our heart" - and nevertheless to maintain contact with Abelard, to the scientific field transforms. She demands information from Abelard about the origin of monasticism and asks him to draw up a monastic rule with special consideration for the female sex. — Abelard does not fail to answer both concerns, but sets them down in two detailed treatises (Letters VII and VIII), of which the second, in our terms, should be called a book rather than a letter. I have included them both in their entirety,

It is characteristic of Abelard that at the end of his monastic rules, in the spirit of Benedict, he emphatically ordered the nuns to study science. In the ninth letter, Heloise writes to Abelard that they often encounter obstacles in their efforts to follow his instructions, since they often lack the necessary understanding and cannot settle individual questions. And so she puts it to him forty-two questions to be answered, mostly related to the way the nuns read the Bible. These questions have been handed down to us together with Abelard's answers; but of course I did not include them in our collection of letters. Because this question and answer book lacks any personal character and is of exclusively scientific interest. — Letters X and XI are Abelard's accompanying letters for literary shipments to Heloise. The tenth letter is interesting in that it recapitulates a letter from Heloisen to Abelard, in which she complains about the abuses that prevail in relation to the religious chants in her monastery. As a result of this suggestion, Abelard himself composed a large number of hymns for the nuns to use in worship, and in his accompanying letter he appended the usual scholarly braid to this collection. - TheThe eleventh letter is a short note that Abelard sent to Heloise with a collection of his own sermons. Finally, the twelfth letter contains Abelard's creed. Apparently he had found it necessary to reassure his girlfriend of his orthodoxy, so vehemently contested by his opponents. The epistle has come down to us through a writing by his faithful and pugnacious pupil Berengar; the confession contained therein sounds very orthodox to our standards. - The torture screw of the question of authenticity has already been applied to these letters, but without success: if any document is from the Middle Ages, then they bear the stamp of authenticity themselves. —

To understand the letters it is necessary to say a few words about the main propositions and teachings of Abelard . We see from the autobiography what appeal literary struggles, scientific disputations and discussions had for Abelard. At that time there seemed to have been a veritable frenzy of debate among the student youth. Everything and nothing was proven using the dialectical method, and it was believed in many cases at that time that “if you only heard words, you should be able to think something.” Abelard was a born debate genius, and even as a young, inexperienced student, he troubled the teachers with his belligerence.

In the field of philosophy at that time the cardinal question, over which the scholars divided into two camps, was the question of the relation of general concepts to individual things (e.g. mankind - man). The dispute went back to Plato and Aristotle. According to Plato, only the general, the idea, has real existence, while the individual things are only weak imperfect images, shadows, so to speak. So e.g. B. the idea, the archetype of beauty (in another world), real existence and everything that we find beautiful here in this world is only a reflection of this ideal. Contrary to this opinion, Aristotle taught: real being comes only to the individual thingOK, the general terms only exist in human thinking, are nothing but combinations of the human mind, just nothing but concepts ( nomina ).

From the eleventh century onward, realism and nominalism became the watchwords which the parties took up their banners according to whether they adhered to Plato or to Aristotle. The actual scientific founder of nominalism is Roscelinus; the main representative of realism William of Champeaux. Both were Abelard's tutors, but neither could do him complete satisfaction. We read in Abelard's first letter with what audacity he compelled William of Champeaux to change his doctrine. The example of Roscelin shows that these philosophical theories, depending on how they were applied to theology, could lead to questionable results. As a consistent nominalist, he denied the real existence of the general concept of "divinity" and he was left with only the three individual beings father, son, spirit as really existing, while he lost unity in and despite the Trinity, so that he was accused of the heresy of tritheism (the doctrine of the three gods). Since then, nominalism has been suspect and disreputable to the representatives of the Church. But Abelard himself also fought this nominalism of his former teacher, and in the pending question he took his position halfway between Roscelinus and William of Champeaux, in that he taught: the concept, of course, is the universal ground and essence of individual things and must not (as the nominalists claimed) merely as a mere abstraction of mind and imagination. However, one should just as little ascribe an existence separate from the individual things to the general concepts (like the realists), rather the general only appears in the world of reality in connection with the individual.

If Abelard's philosophical standpoint under the influence of Plato's theory of ideas is more realistic (i.e. correct according to the concepts of the time) than nominalistic, his scientific efforts in the field of theology did not aim at the decomposition and dissolution of ecclesiastical dogmas, but at what If the whole of scholastic theology aimed to prove the reasonableness of the existing dogmas intellectually, he also wanted that. Only he went about his work with a boldness and consistency that was bound to arouse sharp opposition to him in a short time. Already his principle of knowledge turned the previous view upside down. Until now the principle in the Church had applied: “ credo, ut intellegam(“I believe, so that I understand”), d. H. faith must precede understanding. Abelard, on the other hand, taught that the starting point of all knowledge is doubt ; to believe something without first understanding it is absurd and unworthy.

Abelard was most violently attacked for his doctrine of the Trinity ; in his "Story of the Passion" he vividly describes how he had to burn the book in which this teaching was contained at the synod of Soissons (1121); and twenty years later, at the Synod of Sens, where he was definitively condemned, this doctrine was held against him as heresy. For he taught the following about the Trinity: The substance of the one Deity is determined in detail by the three names Father, Son, Spirit. Father is called the deity according to the quality of omnipotence that belongs to it, son according to its wisdom, holy spirit according to its love and goodness. So God is Father, Son and Spirit, i. H. he is almighty, wise and kind. This doctrine showed a questionable affinity with Sabellius' doctrine of the Trinity, which the Church condemned, who took the three persons of the deity as different forms of revelation of the one deity ( modalism ).

His ethical principles and the resulting doctrine of sin must also have caused great offense . According to Abelard, it is not the deed as performed that is relevant for the moral judgment, but the attitude from which it springs. The soldiers who crucified the Lord, thinking they were doing some good, have not sinned. On the other hand, sin may be present where the sinful act has not yet happened. Eve had already committed her fall from grace the moment she made up her mind to eat the apple. Everything depends on having love. "Have only love and do what you like." We hear the echo of this teaching repeatedly in the letters.

While Abelard so greatly misunderstood the deep seriousness of sin, he also stepped forward with his doctrine of salvationin sharp contrast to Church doctrine. The church accepted Anselm of Canterbury's theory of satisfaction, according to which God, through the devotion of his Son, blotted out the first sin and redeemed mankind from the eternal ruin that springs from that sin. How, Abelard exclaims, can the comparatively minor sin be atoned for by the infinitely greater one, as manifested in the killing of God! Rather, salvation consists in an inward, purely moral process. In the life, suffering and death of Jesus such a powerful love for humanity is manifested that it necessarily ignites in us a return love of such power that we are thereby redeemed from the bondage of sin and become children of God. —

These were the main false teachings that Abelard made a reproach, and such single sentences were of course needed if one wanted to convict him of heresy at church meetings. Basically, however, the battle in which Abelard fought and finally fell was a much more principled one. It was the great contrast between dialectic and contemplative mysticism to which he fell victim. At that time the latter trend was gaining momentum through its intellectually powerful representative, Bernhard von Clairvaux. He is one of the two opponents that Abelard sees looming like threatening clouds on his horizon at the end of his “story of woe”, and he has succumbed to his machinations. While dialectics sought to gain insight into faith and knowledge of God through the mediation of the intellect, mysticism wanted to experience and grasp the deity directly.the love . "God is known insofar as he is loved " was his principle. It is not reflection and logical conclusions that lead to the nearness of God, but sanctification , the highest flower of which is ecstasy , which of course only a few in particularly consecrated moments experience, and by means of which the soul soars up to the direct contemplation and enjoyment of the deity. In this state, revelations are made known to her such as can never be attained through study and science.

This mighty man, from whom even the head of the church willingly accepted instruction, invited the much persecuted man to a decisive battle at the synod in Sens in 1141. The long-prepared blow fell devastatingly on Abelard's head. It is true that he appealed to the pope about the verdict of the synod, which accused him of heresy; alone in vain. The papal verdict was excommunication, life imprisonment in a monastery and the burning of his writings. Abelard wanted to do his own thing in Rome and set off. But he didn't get far. On the way the weary wanderer stopped at Clugny Abbey; Abbot Petrus the Venerable took him in and offered him his monastery as a permanent asylum for the short time that was still granted to him. Abelard made his peace through Peter's mediation with the church and with Bernhard, and spent at least the last year of his life undisturbed in the peace of the monastery.We have a graphic account of the last days of life that Peter sent to Heloise. Full of satisfaction, the venerable abbot points out how faithful and ecclesiastical, we would like to say how orthodox, the great scholar died. But the report makes the melancholy impression on us that the bold warrior who was once so powerful in spirit has passed away as a physically and mentally broken man. The relevant passage in the letter of Abbot Peter is translated as follows: "As far as I know, I do not remember having seen his peers in a humble attitude and gesture, so that to an attentive observer neither Germanus could appear inferior nor even Martinus appear poorer . Although in the great company of our brothers he occupied a higher position at my instigation, in his neglected robes he seemed to be the last of them all. Often, when he led the others with me in processions according to custom, I wondered and marveled that a man of such great name could despise and humiliate himself so very much. There are people in our order for whom their spiritual garments cannot be precious enough; he was so modest in this respect that he contented himself with the most inconspicuous. He did the same with food and drink and with all bodily needs. Not only what was superfluous, but everything that was not absolutely necessary, he rejected for himself and others in word and example. He was constantly occupied with reading, often engrossed in prayer; he only broke his silence when confidential intercourse with the brethren or a public lecture on divine things in the convent compelled him to do so. He celebrated the heavenly sacraments as often as he could, offering to God the sacrifice of the everlasting Lamb; indeed, having regained papal grace by my letters and employment, he almost constantly took part in it. What should I do a lot of words? His spirit, his mouth, his way of doing thought, taught, and testified at all times divine, philosophical, scientific truths. So he lived with us a while longer, bad and right, fearing God and avoiding evil, and dedicating the last days of his life to God. Suffering from a severe rash and other physical ailments, I sent him to Châlons to recover. Near the city, on the Saône river, one of the loveliest parts of our Burgundy country, I had arranged for him a suitable stay. Here he resumed his usual studies, as far as his illness permitted, and sat steadily over his books. And as is said of Gregory the Great, he never let a moment go by without praying, reading, writing or dictating. In the practice of such pious works, the Visitor of whom the Gospel speaks, found him on his coming, and not asleep like many, but waking. Yes, he found him awake and called him to the heavenly wedding, not as a foolish but as a wise virgin. For he carried with him the lamp filled with oil, that is a conscience filled with the testimony of holy conduct. Paying the collective toll of mortality, he became more and more seized by the disease, and in a short time attained the goal. How pious, how devoted to God, how completely Catholic he confessed his faith and his sins, with what fervor his longing heart received the last provisions and the pledge of eternal life, namely the body of the Lord our Redeemer, how believing he was in body and soul recommended to him for time and eternity, as testified by all the brothers of the monastery where the body of the holy martyr Marcellus rests. So Master Petrus ended the days of his life. Known and famous everywhere for his knowledge and teaching, he endured meekly and humbly in the school of him who said, 'Learn from me, for I am meek and humble in heart,' and so we can believe that he went over to himself.”

 

A chronological overview of the lives of Abelard and Heloisens results in the following according to the current state of research Dates: Abelard was born at Palais near Nantes in 1079; Heloise [2]born at Paris 1101. In 1113 Abelard is head of the Paris school. After a long absence he returned to Paris in 1117 and in 1118 met the then seventeen-year-old Heloise, their relationship lasted during the year 1118-19. The founding of the monastery "Zum Paraklet" by Abelard falls in the year 1123. From 1125 Abelard is in the monastery of St. Gildas. In 1129, Heloise and her nuns were expelled from St. Denis. The bull of Pope Innocent II dates from 1131, in which the transfer of the Paracletes to Heloise is confirmed. The “story of suffering” (Letter I) dates from around 1132. In 1134 Abelard left the monastery of St. Gildas. In 1136 he was again a teacher on the mountain of St. Genoveva. In 1141 he was condemned at the Council of Sens and died in 1142 in the monastery of St. Marcel near Châlons-sur-Saône. Heloise succeeds him in 1163.

I Letter.
Abelard to a friend.
(The story of suffering.)

Usually it is not words, but tangible examples that most excite or calm the human heart. That's why I've decided to write down the story of my suffering to comfort you , after I've already tried to cheer you up with verbal encouragement when you last stayed with me. Recognize from these lines that what you call sufferings are none at all in comparison with mine, or at least only minor afflictions - and learn to bear them patiently.

I was born in the town of Palais, on the border of Brittany, about eight hours east of Nantes. A lively temperament and a keen sense of science was the inheritance of my native soil, or of the blood that coursed in my veins. My father had done some science before he donned the armaments of a knight, and afterwards he was so keen on study that he made sure that all his sons had scientific training before they practiced arms. And so it happened. I was the firstborn, and the more he grew fond of me as such, the more he was anxious to teach me carefully. The advances which I made in the sciences with so little trouble, I became so strong to them that I gave up all martial splendor along with my inheritance and the privileges of my firstborn and, leaving the discipleship of Mars, placed myself entirely in the service of Minerva. And since I preferred the armory of dialectics to all systems of philosophy, I discarded my previous armor and chose the battles of the spirit instead of war trophies. I became a kind of peripatetic, disputing and wandering through the regions where it was said that the art of dialectics was particularly well developed.

So I came to Paris, where this science had flourished from time immemorial. William of Champeaux, who enjoyed a well-deserved reputation in this subject, became my teacher. I went to his school for a while and at first got on well with him; but soon I became extremely uncomfortable with him, since I tried to refute some of his statements and repeatedly dared to attack him with counter-arguments, in which I was visibly superior to him several times. Even the most important of my classmates became extremely indignant about this, all the more so since I was the youngest and had the shortest time to study of all of them. And so began the long chain of my sufferings, which still have not come to an end, and the further my reputation spread, the more fiercely did the envy of my adversaries flare up. It happened, that I, still as a very young man, pushed my youthful strength excessively, trusting in my spiritual gifts, to found my own school and I already had a scene in mind for my future deeds: namely Melun, a place that was then used as a royal residence was of some importance. My teacher perceived my intention, and in order to keep my school as far away from his as possible, while I was still attending his school, he secretly offered all means to prevent the establishment of my own and to give me the place where which was of some importance as a royal residence at the time. My teacher perceived my intention, and in order to keep my school as far away from his as possible, while I was still attending his school, he secretly offered all means to prevent the establishment of my own and to give me the place where which was of some importance as a royal residence at the time. My teacher perceived my intention, and in order to keep my school as far away from his as possible, while I was still attending his school, he secretly offered all means to prevent the establishment of my own and to give me the place where I had chosen to make impossible. But he had become enemies with some influential lords of the country; with their help I carried my plan to fruition, and it was precisely his obvious resentment that gained me the confidence of the majority. From the very first attempts I made in teaching I gained such a reputation as a master of dialectics that the fame of my classmates even that of my teacher began to fade. So my self-confidence grew more and more and I did not rest until I had transferred my school as soon as possible to Corbeil, where, because of the proximity of Paris, my impetuosity for dialectical struggles had more opportunities.
