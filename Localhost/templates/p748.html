From the Richmond Whig.
The Literary Messenger.—The high reputation of this periodical is acknowledged by others besides ourselves, and much more competent judges. The Lynchburg Virginian says:

"The Messenger, upon the whole, reflects credit upon Virginia and the entire South. Indeed, several distinguished Northern Journals place it at the head of periodical literature in the United States—a most enviable distinction when we recollect the eminent names that figure in our Monthlies, both as editors and contributors. Mr. White deserves the thanks of the people of the South for his untiring perseverance and industry, and we are glad to hear that he is receiving them in the most substantial form—to wit, paying subscribers."
And Mr. Paulding in a letter to the proprietor says:

"P. S.—Your publication is decidedly superior to any Periodical in the United States, and Mr. Poe as decidedly the best of all our young writers; I don't know but I might add all our old ones, with one or two exceptions, among which I assure you I don't include myself."

From the New York Spirit of the Times.
The Southern Literary Messenger.—This is the earliest magazine of the month, and we are as pleased to see it as an old favorite after a long absence, and welcome it accordingly.

Some change has taken place since last we saw it, in the editorial department, but it affects not at all the interest of the magazine; and we think the critical notices of this number, whether written by the old or new editor, more elevated in their tone than previously. There is a slight taint of pedantry about them, perhaps; and in one instance undue severity is shown towards a clever young author: yet they are, in the main, clever and just. But, as we have before said, we prize a magazine for other qualities than mere deserts in criticism; therefore turn we to the articles.

The first one is a continuation of "Sketches of the History, &c. of Tripoli." These sketches are from an unknown hand, which has access to original documents from which to draw his facts, and the author seems familiar with the writings of the French historians on the subject. So wofully ignorant are we of the history of the Barbary Powers, that we are unable to judge of the accuracy of these sketches: but we may safely say, that the narrative is lucid and interesting, and evinces an intimate acquaintance with the subject; and that it has a peculiar interest for American readers just now, as the French system of Finance and Diplomacy are constantly illustrated in their negotiations with the Deys. We can scarcely read with patience the narrative of the duplicity of the French Government towards these piratical states; with them, as with us, knavishly objecting to the allowance of a claim because of its absoluteness, or its negotiation; and skulking from the payment of an honest and acknowledged debt with an infinite deal of balderdash about French honor insulted, or French dignity offended. French honor and dignity!! Bah!

The next prose article consists of "Extracts from my Mexican Journal." We have been so tired of late with this subject, in the American Monthly, that for the life of us we cannot screw our courage up to the reading point.

The poetry of this number is of superior quality. This is peculiarly the ladies' department, and of course we may not deny that they sustain it perfectly. One little gem in this number is the "Broken Heart," by a Virginia lady—of rare simplicity of thought and purpose, and most touchingly executed. Our readers shall see it anon, and learn somewhat further our ideas of the poetical excellence of this capital magazine.

Mr. Edgar A. Poe, a writer of much versatility of talent has contributed much to this number. He is a magazinist somewhat in the style of Willis: he needs condensation of thought. But this is too flippant criticism for us, and we will read him more. Although the earliest out, we have not had time to complete this magazine.


From the Norfolk Beacon.
The first number of the second volume of the Southern Literary Messenger contains several articles of solid worth. The "Tripoli Sketches" retain their spirit and fidelity. Mr. Minor's Address is a patriotic and practical production. The common school system of the state demands the public attention. No voter should let his representatives alone, until such a system shall have been established as will insure to the child of every honest man in the commonwealth a thorough [p. 139]elementary education. Mr. Minor quotes his statistics concerning Russia from the Edinburgh Review, but he would have found a more full examination of the Prussian system in a late number of the Foreign Quarterly. We were pleased that Mr. Minor handsomely recognized the services of the late Mr. Fitzhugh of Fairfax in the cause of education. We well remember his speech on the occasion alluded to, and know that the seeming defect in his scheme alluded to by Mr. Minor, was in truth the result of design. It was the main argument with which Mr. Fitzhugh met the opponents of his favorite scheme. Were Fitzhugh now living, he would win enduring laurels in the cause of general education in the commonwealth. The present address of Mr. Minor has also appeared in pamphlet from the press of Mr. White, and we have marked one or two striking passages for our columns. "Lionel Granby" is continued, and we have a very amusing letter from the uncle. But he has fallen into the error not uncommon, of imputing to York Town the honor of giving birth to Bishop Beilby Porteus. The Bishop, we believe, was born in York, but in England, and not in Virginia. The parents of the Bishop removed from Gloucester to England some years before his birth. Had he been born in Virginia, he would, it is probable, have bequeathed to William and Mary some of the fat legacies which were shared by sundry institutions in Great Britain.

The Critical Notices in the present number of the Messenger, particularly of the North American and the British Reviews are in bad taste. The review of Glass's Life of Washington is altogether unique. Some of the reviews are nevertheless good, and more than outweigh those that are bad.

One word more, and we have done with the present number. We are more and more convinced every passing hour of the importance to the South of an able periodical journal devoted to literary and other topics that know no party. However well conducted a political journal may be, it never will penetrate generally to the firesides of the South. And it is clear that the general mind cannot be reached through such an avenue. Now this important office literature can perform. There are, too, many opinions which are peculiar to the South, to the whole South, and to the South only. There should be a channel of communication on these subjects, and such a means the Messenger, if liberally supported by the pens of the able, and the purses of the patriotic, may readily become. It rests with our community to make the first movement in the cause, and we trust that our citizens will not be found wanting, when the South—the whole South—appeals to their liberality.


From the Lynchburg Virginian.
Southern Literary Messenger.—The 1st No. of the 2d volume of this periodical, in its typographical department, exhibits a decided improvement upon its predecessors, although on this score its subscribers have never had reasonable cause of complaint. Its literary reputation is fully maintained.

The 9th No. of the Sketches of the Barbary States, written by Mr. Robert Greenhow, Jr. formerly of Richmond, and now engaged in the Department of State, is, like the preceding Nos. highly creditable to that gentleman, betokening research, genius and taste. His style is admirably adapted to his theme.

The continuation of Extracts from a Mexican Journal are highly interesting—containing graphic descriptions of the manners, customs, &c. of a country, which, although on our own continent, is, to the great mass of our people, a terra incognita.

The most valuable article in the December No. of the Messenger, however, is the Address delivered by Lucian Minor, Esq. before the Institute of Education of Hampden Sidney College, at its late anniversary. He urges upon our Legislators, with earnestness and eloquence, the importance of enlightening the people, by a well digested system of primary instruction—based on the models which are presented to us in several of our sister States, in Scotland and in Prussia. This is a vitally important subject, and we sincerely hope it will attract the serious attention of the Legislature, during its present session.

"Lionel Granby" contributes largely to the interest of the Messenger. We hope he will diminish the intervals of his appearance on the stage.

Several of the poetical pieces are beautiful—others, mediocre. "October," "Marcelia," "Mother and Child," may be classed among the former; "A Sketch" among the latter. "Scenes from Politian," like the prose productions from the same pen (Mr. Poe) evince great powers, wasted on trifles. Why, (to adopt the catechetical style of his own criticisms,) why does Mr. Poe throw away his strength on shafts and columns, instead of building a temple to his fame? Can he not execute as well as design? No one can doubt it who is conversant with his writings. Eschew affectation, Mr. Poe. It is a blot upon genius as well as upon beauty. "A Broken Heart" contains several tender and pathetic passages, but is deficient as a whole. Ex gr.:

"Friends and physicians
Exert their skill most faithfully,"
is not poetry—but plain, unsophisticated prose.

Too much space is allotted to "Critical Notices" in the December No. of the Messenger—and several of the Notices themselves are too dogmatical and flippant. This department of a periodical, on the plan of the Messenger, is necessarily of restricted interest, and should consequently be of proportionate limits, except in extraordinary cases. It certainly should not be occupied by reviews of Reviews—a dish of hash newly warmed, and served up, in all its insipidity, to an already palled appetite. Such reviews as that of Mr. Fay's "Norman Leslie" will be read. Men—and Women likewise—will always be attracted in crowds to behold an infliction of the Russian knout or to see a fellow-creature flayed alive. And Mr. Fay—who, by the way, is a great favorite with us—fully deserves a "blistering" for putting forth such a book as Norman Leslie.

The "Messenger," upon the whole, reflects credit upon Virginia and the entire South. Indeed, several distinguished Northern journals place it at the head of periodical literature in the U. States; a most enviable distinction, when we recollect the eminent names that figure in our Monthlies, both as editors and contributors. Mr. White deserves the thanks of the people of the South for his untiring perseverance and industry, and we are glad to [p. 140]hear that he is receiving them in the most substantial form—to wit, paying subscribers. We hope his list will continue to augment, not only because his enterprise deserves remuneration, but because every additional subscriber enables him to make additional exertions to enhance the value of his agreeable and instructive "Messenger."


From the New Yorker.
The Southern Literary Messenger—We have long meditated a more extended notice of this elegant periodical, than we have hitherto found leisure to give—not more on account of our numerous Southern friends—with whom it must necessarily be a favorite, than of our literature generally, to which the Messenger forms a very creditable addition. And notwithstanding that our columns for this week are mainly bespoken, we must not allow the current number—being the first of a new volume—to pass from our table without a brief glance over its contents.

"Sketches of the History and Present Condition of Tripoli, with some account of the other Barbary States," is the opening paper, written by one evidently conversant with his subject, and whose chapters are calculated to add materially to the meager stock of popular information hitherto possessed with regard to the history and present condition of the Barbary powers.

"Scraps from an Unpublished Drama, by Edgar A. Poe," contains one or two stirring and many beautiful passages—but we are not partial to dramatic poetry.

Speaking of poetry, we find some that is commendable, and much that we deem, with all deference, well nigh execrable. Of the former class is "October."

Of the otherwise, nearly all that is intended for blank verse may serve as a specimen. It is singular that people will continue, in the face of good advice, to break up sober prose into unequal and most inharmonious lines, and then attempt to pass it off for verse, which it very remotely resembles. The following is extracted from an article which really contains poetry.

                                 "The story goes, that a
Neglected girl (an orphan whom the world
Frowned upon) once strayed thither, and 't was thought
Did cast her in the stream."
"An Address on Education," by Lucian Minor, is among the best articles in the Messenger. It were well if such a startling exhibition of facts, such an array Of cogent reasonings, were presented to every influential citizen of our vast Union.

"Extracts from my Mexican Journal" are judicious and replete with information. We remark that, since recent occurrences have rendered Mexico an object of interest in this country, the observations of tourists and men of business who have lately visited that country, are very liberally drawn upon by our Monthlies.

"The Wissahiccon," and its romantic scenery, is made the subject of enthusiastic description—by a Philadelphian, of course. Well, truth to say, there are some enchanting spots out of Philadelphia, to say nothing of those within it. If we could only bring her self-satisfied citizens to admit that a civilized person may while away a season in New York, without positive privation of all quiet, cleanliness, and comfort, why then we might in turn regard the Quaker capital as a very tolerable, inoffensive, well-behaved city. As it is, we must think of it, and hope that time will take the conceit out of her.

"Lionel Granby" is the title of a series of odd, pedantic, yet humorous and characteristic papers, which we are tempted to consider the best light reading in the Messenger. To an old-school Virginian, they must be delightful.

The critical department of the Messenger is managed with great candor, consideration and ability. We place the qualifications in this order, not that the ability is less prominent, but because it is perhaps of the three least enviable in a reviewer. The Editor examines with impartiality, judges with fairness, commends with evident pleasure, and condemns with moderation. May he live a thousand years!—or at least to have five thousand gratified, substantial and 'available' patrons.


From the Baltimore Gazette.
The Southern Literary Messenger.—A little more than a year has elapsed since Mr. White commenced, in Richmond, Virginia, the publication of a Monthly Literary Journal. At that time an experiment of the kind, south of Mason and Dixon's line, was considered a novel one, but the ability with which it has been conducted, and the wide circulation it has obtained, have fully demonstrated that it required but talent and persevering energy on the one part, and a liberal co-operation on the other, to impart to it a reputation equal to that enjoyed by any other of our Monthlies. We have now before us the first number of the second volume, whose pages we find diversified with a variety of entertaining and excellent matter. The publisher has secured the assistance of a gentleman of eminent literary talents, with whose aid it may fairly be inferred that the Messenger will not only sustain but increase its already extensive and deserved popularity. The literary notices contained in this number are written with great ability, but in our opinion rather too great a space has been devoted to this subject. The old adage—ne quid nimis—is applicable not less to a literary undertaking than to the general pursuits of life.


From the Petersburg Constellation.
The Southern Literary Messenger.—We have received the first number of the second volume of Mr. White's popular and valuable Literary Messenger. We bid it a more cordial welcome to our table, admiring in proportion to their relative merits, the unrivalled professional skill with which its typographical dress is adjusted, and the rich and attractive guise which wit, genius and learning have combined to throw over the pages of what must now be acknowledged as the first monthly magazine in this country. The contributions, prose and poetical, are of a high grade of excellence; and the critiques are now precisely what they should be in such a work—faithful mirrors, reflecting in miniature the book reviewed, and exposing alike its beauties and deformities without favor or affection. We have rarely read a review more caustic or more called for than the flaying which the new editor of the Messenger has so judiciously given Mr. Fay's "bepuffed, beplastered and be-Mirrored" novel of "Norman Leslie."
