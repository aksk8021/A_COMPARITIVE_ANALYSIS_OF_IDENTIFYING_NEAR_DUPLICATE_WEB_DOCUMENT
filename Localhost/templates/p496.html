Judicial singularities were numerous and varied in the Middle Ages, and magistrates often intervened in such bizarre circumstances that we find it difficult to understand, nowadays, how these serious organs of justice could reasonably figure in such affairs.

However, our goal is not to criticize more or less absurd uses here, but simply to note their existence. We limit our role to telling the facts, except for the reader to draw the consequences himself.

Several centuries separate us from the epoch whose customs and ideas we seek to study, which form with ours such strange disparities; also it is only after scrupulous research made in the works of the most respectable jurisconsults and historians, that we have dared to present this rapid sketch.

In the Middle Ages, all reprehensible acts of any being emanated, even animals, were submitted to the action of justice.

The history of jurisprudence offers us at this time numerous examples of trials in which bulls, cows, horses, pigs, sows, roosters, rats, field mice, slugs, ants, caterpillars, grasshoppers, flies, worms and leeches.

The procedure which had been adopted for the prosecution of these sorts of cases assumed very special forms; this procedure was different, according to the nature of the animals which it was a question of prosecuting.

If the animal author of an offense—such as a pig, a sow, an ox, for example—can be seized, apprehended in the body , he is brought before the ordinary criminal court, he is assigned there personally ; but if it is about animals on which one cannot put the hand, such as insects or other beasts harmful to the ground, it is not before the ordinary criminal court that one will bring these offenders elusive , but before the ecclesiastical tribunal, that is to say before the officiality.

Indeed, what would ordinary justice do against an invasion of flies, weevils, caterpillars, slugs? it is powerless to take action against the devastation caused by these terrible scourges; but religious justice, which is related to the Divinity, will know how to reach the guilty; she possesses the means: all she has to do is fulminate excommunication.

Such were, in matters of lawsuits against animals, the principles admitted by the jurisconsults of the Middle Ages. We now come to the proof of this assertion.

Let us first speak of the lawsuits prosecuted against animals before ordinary criminal justice.

As we still see today in certain localities, pigs and sows, in the Middle Ages, ran freely through the streets of the villages, and it often happened that they devoured children; then we proceeded directly against these animals by criminal means. Here's how the procedure went:

The animal, that is to say the delinquent , was incarcerated in the prison of the seat of criminal justice where the trial was to be heard. The procurator or promoter of the causes ex officio, that is to say, the officer who exercised the functions of the public ministry before the seigniorial justice, required the indictment of the culprit. After the hearing of the witnesses and having seen their affirmative depositions concerning the fact imputed to the accused, the promoter made his requisitions, on which the judge of the place rendered a sentence declaring the animal guilty of homicide, and condemned it definitively to be strangled and hung by the two hind legs from an oak or sinister pitchforks, according to the custom of the country.

From the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, the splendours of jurisprudence and history furnish numerous examples of the use of this procedure followed against pigs and sows which had devoured children, and who, for this fact, were condemned to to be hanged.

We will mention in this regard the following sentences and executions:

Year 1266. — Pig burned at Fontenay-aux-Roses, near Paris, for having devoured a child1 .

September 1394. — Pig hanged at Mortaing, for having killed a child of the parish of Roumaigne2 .

Year 1404. —Three pigs tortured at Rouvres, in Burgundy, for having killed a child in its cradle3 .

July 17, 1408. — Pig hanged at Vaudreuil for an act of the same nature, in accordance with the sentence of the bailly of Rouen and the consuls, pronounced at the assizes of Pont-de-l'Arche held on the 13th of the same month4 .

December 24, 1414. — Small pig dragged and hung by the hind legs, for murder of a child, according to sentence of the mayor and aldermen of Abbeville5 .

February 14, 1418. —Another pig guilty of the same act and hanged in the same manner, by virtue of a sentence of the mayeur and the aldermen of Abbeville6 .

Around 1456. — Pig hanged in Burgundy for a similar cause7 .

January 10, 1457. —Sow hanged at Savigny for the murder of a five-year-old child8 .

Year 1473. — Pig hanged at Beaune by judgment of the provost of that city, for having eaten a child in its cradle9 .

April 10, 1490. — Pig hanged for bruising (killing) a child in its bers (cradle). The Red Book of Abbeville, which mentions this fact, adds that the sentence of the mayor of Abbeville was pronounced by this magistrate on the lead of the eschevinage, to the sound of the bells, on the 10th day of April 149010 .

June 14, 1494. —Sentence of the Grand Mayor of Saint-Martin de Laon condemning a pig to be hanged for having defaced and strangled a young child in its cradle11 .

Year 1497. —Sow condemned to be knocked unconscious for having eaten the chin of a child in the village of Charonne. The sentence further ordered that the flesh of this sow be cut off and thrown to the dogs; that the owner and his wife would make the pilgrimage to Notre-Dame de Pontoise, where being the day of Pentecost, they would cry: Thank you! from which they brought back a certificate12 .

April 18, 1499. —Sentence condemning a pig to be hanged, at Sèves, near Chartres, for having killed a young child13 .

Year 1540. — Pig hanged at Brochon, in Burgundy, for a similar act, following sentence rendered in the justice of the Carthusians of Dijon14 .

May 20, 1572. —Sentence of the mayor and aldermen of Nancy condemning a pig to be strangled and hanged for having devoured a child in Moyen-Moutier15 .

Judgments and decrees in this matter were maturely deliberated and gravely pronounced; see this passage from a sentence rendered by the judge of Savigny, on January 10, 1457; this is a sow:

"... It is to know that for the part of the said plaintiff, we have cited, urged in this case, in the presence of the said defendant present and not contradicting, why we, judge, said, know do to all that we proceeded and given our final award in the following manner; it is to know that in view the case is such as was proposed for the party of the said plaintiff and of which it appears to sufficiency, both by testimony and otherwise by hue. Also advice with saiges and practitioners16 and also to consider in this case the use and custom of the country of Bourgoigne, having God before our eyes, we say and pronounce for our final sentence and right and herewith our dictated sentence, declare the sow of Jean Bailli, alias ( in other words) Valot, for reason of the multer and homicide by this sow committed... to be hung by the feet of the rear from a speared tree, etc.

The execution was public and solemn; sometimes the animal appeared dressed as a man. In 1386 a sentence of the judge of Falaise condemned a sow to be mutilated in the leg and in the head, and successively hanged for having torn in the face and in the arm and killed a child. They wanted to inflict the punishment of retaliation on the animal. This sow was executed in the town square, dressed as a man; the execution cost ten pennies ten tournament deniers, plus a new glove for the executor of high works17 . The author of the Histoire du duché de Valois , who reports the same fact18 , adds that this glove is worn on the bill of costs and expenses for a sum of six sub-tournaments, and that in the receipt given to the Count of Falaise by the executioner, the latter declares that he is satisfied with it. and let him leave the king our lord and the said viscount . Here is a legally condemned sow!

We also find in an account of March 15, 140319 the following details of the expense incurred on the occasion of the execution of a sow, which was condemned to be hanged at Meulan for having devoured a child:

“For expenditure made for her in the jail, six Parisian sols20 ;

“ Item , to the master of high works, who came from Paris to Meulan to carry out the said execution by the command and ordinance of our said master the bailiff and of the king's attorney, fifty-four parisian sols;

“ Item , for car which brought her to justice, six sols parisis;

“ Item , for strings to bind and haul, two sols eight deniers parisis;

“ Item , for men, two Parisian deniers.”

By granting gloves to the executioner, we no doubt wanted, according to the mores of the time, that his hands should come out clean from the execution of a brute beast .

An account of 1479, from the municipality of Abbeville, teaches us that a pig, also condemned for the murder of a child, was led to execution in a cart; that the mace sergeants escorted him to the gallows, and that the executioner received sixty sous for his trouble21 .

For a similar execution carried out in 1435 in Tronchères, a village in Burgundy, the carnacier (the executioner) also received a sum of sixty cents.22 .

The formalities were so well observed in this kind of procedure, that we find in the file of the affair of April 18, 1499, mentioned above, up to the report of the service made on the pig in the prison where the 'the condemned were dropped off before being taken to the place of execution.

One also proceeded by the same legal means against the bulls guilty of murders. In pursuit, identical formalities were observed with those which we have just indicated.

Indeed, let us listen to the author of the Histoire du duché de Valois , who relates23 the following fact:

“A farmer from the village of Moisy let an untamed bull escape. This bull having met a man, pierced him with his horns; the man only survived his injuries for a few hours. Charles, Count of Valois, having learned of this accident at the Château de Crépy, gave orders to apprehend the bull and put him on trial. We seize the murderous beast. The officers of the Comte de Valois went to the scene to make the required information; and on the deposition of the witnesses they ascertained the truth and the nature of the offence. The bull was condemned to be hanged. The execution of this judgment took place at the sinister forks of Moisy-le-Temple. The death of a beast thus expiated that of a man.

“This torture did not end the scene. There was an appeal against the sentence of the officers of the count, as incompetent judges, in the parliament of Candlemas of 1314. This appeal was drawn up in the name of the public prosecutor of the hospital of the town of Moisy. The public prosecutor of the order intervened. The parliament received complainant the prosecutor of the hospital in case of referral and novelty, against the companies of the officers of the count of Valois. The judgment of the slain bull was found very equitable; but it was decided that the count of Valois had no right of justice on the territory of Moisy, and that the officers should not have instrumented there24. ”

This condemnation is not the only one of its kind. In 1499 a judgment of the bailiwick of the abbey of Beaupré, order of Cîteaux, near Beauvais, rendered on request and information, sentenced to the gallows until death inclusively a bull "for having slain by fury a son of fourteen to fifteen years," in the seigniory of Cauroy, which depended on this abbey25 .

The horses were also criminally prosecuted for the homicides they had committed. The registers of Dijon note that in 1389 a horse, on the information made by the aldermen of Montbar, was condemned to death for having slain a man26 .

From the thirteenth century Philippe de Beaumanoir, in his Customs of Beauvoisis, had not been afraid to point out in forceful terms the absurdity of these proceedings directed against animals on account of the homicides they had committed. “Those,” he said, “who have a right of justice on their lands bring animals who commit murders to trial; for example, when a sow kills a child, they hang her and drag her; the same is true of other animals. But this is not the way to act, for brute beasts know neither good nor evil; and on this point it is justice lost: for justice must be established for the revenge of the crime, and for him who has committed it to know and understand what punishment he has deserved. But discernment is a faculty which is lacking in brute beasts. Therefore he is in error who, in judicial matters, condemns to death a brute beast for the misdeed of which it has been guilty; but that this indicates to the judge that it is in such circumstances the extent of his rights and his duties27. ”

However, the criticisms of the famous jurisconsult were not heeded, and this mode of prosecution continued to be followed in all the trials of this kind, which became so numerous from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century.

Indeed, at the times of which we are speaking, jurisprudence, basing itself moreover on the authority of the holy books28 , had adopted the custom of inflicting on animals punishments proportionate to the offenses of which they were convicted29 .

It was thought that the torment of the gibbet applied to an animal guilty of murder always imprinted the horror of the crime, and that the owner of the animal thus condemned was sufficiently punished by the very loss he made of that animal. Such were the ideas of our fathers on the point which occupies us; but they changed successively. Indeed, from the second half of the sixteenth century, the annals of jurisprudence or historians no longer offer us examples of death sentences .pronounced against oxen or swine, on account of the murder of a man or a child. It is that at that time we had almost given up this mode of procedure as absurd as it is ridiculous against animals, and that for the prosecution of the acts of which they had been guilty, we had returned to the only and true principles on this matter, by condemning the owner of the vermin to a fine and damages. They were no longer putting the evil beast on trial, they were purely and simply ordering it to be stunned.

In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in certain trials where a man was accused of having committed with an animal a crime which we cannot name, the man convicted of this crime was always condemned to be burned with the animal which he had an accomplice30 , and even the documents of the trial were set on fire, in order to bury the memory of the atrocious act which had given rise to it.

Sometimes the animal was strangled before being put on the stake, a favor which the main defendant did not obtain.31 .

A highly renowned jurisconsult, Damhoudère, who was an adviser to Charles V in the Netherlands and who published around the middle of the sixteenth century a treatise on criminal law32 , further maintained that in the circumstances in question the animal, although devoid of reason and not being guilty, should nevertheless be condemned to the penalty of fire, because it had been the instrument of the crime.33 .

It appears that this practice was modified in the eighteenth century, for in a decree rendered by the parliament of Paris, on October 12, 1741, it is noted that the culprit alone was condemned to fire. The animal was killed and thrown into a pit, which was then covered with earth.34 .

Before moving on to another order of ideas, we must cite the following fact, which is reported in these terms in the Swiss Conservator :

“Superstition, says the author of this collection, once persuaded the people that roosters made eggs and that from these cursed eggs came a snake and even a basilisk . Gross recounts in his Little Chronicle of Basle that in the month of August 1474 a rooster of this city was accused of such a misdeed, and that having been duly attacked and convicted, he was condemned to death; justice handed him over to the executioner and the latter publicly burned him with his egg at a place called Kohlenberger , in the midst of a great competition of bourgeois and peasants gathered to see this bizarre execution35. ”

This condemnation is evidently connected with the witchcraft trials, which were so multiplied during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Indeed, sorcerers who wanted to get in touch with Satan were reproached for using in their practices, among other means of evocation, rooster's eggs, no doubt because these eggs were reputed to contain a snake and these reptiles are infinitely pleasing. to hell. It should not therefore seem surprising that at a time when superstition outraged religion, reason and the laws at the same time, an unfortunate rooster was condemned to fire with the egg which he was reputed to have laid, since this egg, in the very minds of the judges, was regarded as an object of legitimate terror, as a production of the demon36 .

Let us now occupy ourselves with the lawsuits brought during the Middle Ages against insects and other animals harmful to the productions of the soil, such as flies, caterpillars, worms, weevils, slugs, rats, moles and field mice.

Often the harvests are devoured by innumerable quantities of insects which invade the territory of a canton or a commune.

In the Middle Ages history frequently mentions calamities of this kind. These scourges produced all the more devastation, as agronomic science, almost in its infancy at that time, offered fewer means to combat these disastrous invasions.

In order to ward off these evils without human remedies, the desolate populations addressed themselves to the ministers of religion. The Church listened to their complaints; granting them her holy intervention, she thundered anathema against these enemies of man, whom she considered as sent by the devil.

Then the affair was brought before the ecclesiastical tribunal, and there it took on the character of a veritable trial, having on one side for plaintiffs the parishioners of the locality, and on the other for defendants the insects which devastated the country. The official, that is to say the ecclesiastical judge, decided the dispute. We followed carefully in the continuation of the lawsuit all the forms of the actions brought to justice. To give an exact idea of ​​this kind of procedure and of the importance attached to observing its forms, we will extract some details from a consultation which was made on this matter by a famous jurisconsult of the sixteenth century.37 . The author of this consultation, or rather of this treatise ex professo , was Barthélemi de Chasseneuz or Chassanée38 , successively lawyer in Autun, adviser to the parliament of Paris and first president of the parliament of Aix.

After speaking from the beginning of the custom where the inhabitants of the territory of Beaune are to ask the officiality of Autun for the excommunication of certain insects larger than flies, and vulgarly called hurebers ( huberes )39 , which they are still granted, Chasseneuz addresses the question of whether such a procedure is appropriate. He divides his subject into five parts, in each of which he seizes the opportunity to display the widest and often the most misplaced scholarship; but this habit, as we know, was common to writers of that time.

Chasseneuz, to console the inhabitants of Beaune for the scourge which afflicts them, teaches them that the hurebers of which they complain are nothing in comparison with those which one meets in the Indies. The latter are not less than three feet long; their legs are armed with teeth, which are made into saws in the country. Often they are seen fighting among themselves with the horns above their heads. The best way to get rid of this scourge of God is to pay the tithes and the ecclesiastical dues exactly, and to have a woman walk around the township barefoot and in the state that Chasseneuz designates in these terms: Accessu mulieris, menstrualis, omnia animalia fructibus terræ officientia flavescunt et sic ex his apparet unum bonum ex muliere menstrua resultare40 .

Indicating the Latin name which best suits the terrible hurebers, our jurisconsult proves that they should be called locustæ ; he fortifies his opinion by quotations which he still borrows from all the authors of sacred and profane antiquity.

The author discusses the point of knowing whether it is permissible to summon the animals in question before a tribunal, and ends after long digressions by deciding that insects can be summoned to justice.41 .

Chasseneuz then examines whether the animals should be cited personally , or whether it suffices that they appear by an attorney . “Any delinquent, he said, must be quoted personally. In principle, he cannot be represented by a proxy either; but is it an offense that the fact imputed to the insects of the country of Beaune? Yes, since the people receive scandals from it, being deprived of drinking wine, which, according to David, gladdens the heart of God and that of man, and whose excellence is demonstrated by the provisions of canon law, prohibiting the promotion to holy orders of anyone who does not like wine42. ”

However Chasseneuz concludes that a defender appointed ex officio by the judge can also present himself for the summoned animals, cause in their name excuses for their non-appearance and the means to establish their innocence, and even exceptions of incompetence or declinations; in a word, to propose all sorts of means in form and substance43 .After discussing at great length the question of knowing before which tribunal the animals should be brought, he decides that knowledge of the offense belongs to the ecclesiastical judge, in other words, to the official.44 .

Finally, in the last part of his treatise, Chasseneuz devotes himself to long research on anathema or excommunication. He develops many arguments by means of which he comes to the conclusion that animals can be excommunicated and cursed. Among these arguments, which are twelve in number, we will point out these:

“It is permissible to cut down and burn the tree which bears no fruit; with all the more reason one can destroy what only causes harm. God wants everyone to enjoy the product of their labor.

“All creatures are subject to God, author of canon law; animals are therefore subject to the provisions of this law.

“Everything that exists was created for man; it would be to misunderstand the spirit of creation to tolerate animals that are harmful to it45 .

“Religion makes it possible to lay traps for birds or other animals which destroy the fruits of the earth. This is what Virgil observes in these verses from the first book of the Georgics :

Rivas deducere nulla
Relligio vetuit, segeti prætendere sepem,
Incidias avibus moliri.
“Now the best of all snares is unquestionably the thunderbolt of anathema46 .

“One can do for the conservation of harvests even what is forbidden by the laws: thus enchantments, spells prohibited by law, are permitted whenever their object is the conservation of the fruits of the earth; we must, with all the more reason, allow the anathematization of insects that devour fruit, since, far from being forbidden as spells are, the anathema is on the contrary a weapon authorized and used by the Church47. ”

In support of these assertions, the author cites examples of similar anathemas, such as those of God towards the serpent and the fig tree; he relates several of them as having taken place in recent times.

It speaks of an excommunication pronounced by a priest against an orchard where children came to pick fruit, instead of going to divine service. This orchard remained sterile until the excommunication was lifted at the request of the mother of the Duke of Burgundy.48 .

Chasseneuz also points out the excommunication fulminated by a bishop against sparrows who previously soiled the church of Saint-Vincent with their garbage and came to disturb the faithful.49 .

But, adds our author, we have in recent times even more decisive examples. He then relates that he saw at Autun sentences of anathema or excommunication pronounced against rats and slugs by the official of this diocese and by those of Lyons and Mâcon; he goes into the details of this procedure; he first gives the model of the request of the parishioners who have experienced the damage caused by the devastating animals. He points out that on this complaint a lawyer is appointed ex officio, who argues on behalf of the animals, his clients, the means he deems fit for their defence; the author reports the ordinary formula of anathema. This formula is conceived in these terms: “Rats, slugs, caterpillars and all you filthy animals who destroy the crops of our brothers, leave the cantons which you desolate and take refuge in those where you can harm no one. In the name of the Father, etc.50. ”

Finally Chasseneuz transcribed verbatim51 the sentences fulminated by the officials of Autun and Lyon; it is noticed against rats, mice, slugs, worms, &c.

These sentences are almost all similar; the difference which exists between them relates only to the delay granted to the animals to clear off; there are some who condemn them immediately; others give them three hours, three days or more; all are followed by the ordinary formulas of anathema and excommunication.

Such was the mode of procedure observed before the ecclesiastical tribunal in proceedings against insects or other animals injurious to the earth.

The consultation of Chasseneuz, of which we have just given a short analysis, acquired for its author, who was then only a lawyer in Autun, a great reputation as a jurisconsult; it earned him, around 1510, to be designated by the officiality of Autun, as a lawyer for rats and to plead their cause in the lawsuits brought against these animals as a result of the devastation they had committed by devouring the rats. wheat from part of Burgundy.

In the defense which he presented, says the president of Thou, who reports this fact52 , Chasseneuz made the judges feel, for excellent reasons, that the rats had not been adjourned in the forms; he obtained that the priests of each parish would notify them of a new adjournment, since in this affair it was a question of the salvation or the ruin of all the rats. He demonstrated that the time they had been given was too short to be able to all appear on the day of the summons; especially since there was no path where the cats were not in ambush to take them. He then used several passages of Holy Scripture to defend his clients, and finally he obtained that they would be granted a longer time to appear.

The theologian Félix Malléolus, commonly called Hemmerlin, who lived a century before Chasseneuz and who had published a treatise on exorcisms53, had also taken care, in the second part of this work, of the procedure directed against animals. He speaks of an ordinance issued by Guillaume de Saluces, Bishop of Lausanne, regarding a lawsuit to be brought against leeches, which corrupted the waters of Lake Geneva and caused the fish to die. One of the articles of this ordinance prescribes that a priest, such as a parish priest, charged with pronouncing curses, appoints a procurator for the people; that this prosecutor summons, by the ministry of a bailiff, in the presence of witnesses, the animals to appear, under pain of excommunication, before the priest on a fixed day. After long debates this ordinance was carried out on March 24, 1451, by virtue of a sentence which the official of Lausanne pronounced, at the request of the inhabitants of this country,

The same author also gives an account of a lawsuit brought in the thirteenth century against the cantharid flies of certain cantons of the electorate of Mainz, and where the local judge, before whom the farmers had cited them, granted them, waited, said he, the smallness of their bodies and in consideration of their young age54 , a curator and orator, who defended them very worthily and obtained that, by driving them out of the country, they were assigned a land where they could retire and live decently. “And even today, adds Félix Malléolus55 , the inhabitants of these regions make a contract each year with the aforesaid cantharids and give up a certain amount of land to these insects, so that these beetles are content with it and do not seek to cross the agreed limits.

The use of these same judicial forms is also revealed to us in a lawsuit brought, around 1587, against a species of weevil ( rynchites auratus) which desolated the vineyards of Saint-Julien, near Saint-Julien de Maurienne. On a complaint addressed by the inhabitants to the official of the bishopric of Maurienne, the latter appointed a procurator for the inhabitants and a lawyer for the insects, and issued an ordinance prescribing processions and prayers, and above all recommending the exact payment of the tithes. After several pleadings, the inhabitants, by the organ of their attorney, had the insects offered a piece of land in which they would have to withdraw under the penalties of law. The defender of insects asked for a delay to deliberate, and the debates having been resumed after a few days, he declared, in the name of his clients, that he could not accept the offer which had been made to them, given that the locality in question was sterile and produced absolutely nothing; which the opposing party denied. Experts were appointed. Unfortunately, the known parts of the trial end there, and it is not known whether the case was resumed and what decision the official pronounced.56 . But these details, united with those which we have given previously, suffice to show what were, three centuries ago, the forms followed in these singular procedures.

We need not dwell on the motives which determined the Church to employ excommunication against animals. We understand what advantage this means could offer to the clergy, on the one hand by the influence which it exercised on the timid and credulous spirit of the populations then ignorant and superstitious; on the other hand, by the pecuniary result, which was always the occult goal of his persevering efforts. However, after several centuries, and thanks to the diffusion of enlightenment, these vicious practices ceased, and we finally saw disappear these abuses of excommunication, equally contrary to the sublime morality of the Gospel and to the true principles of the Catholic faith.

But let's continue our investigation.

The first fulminated excommunication against animals dates back to the twelfth century. Indeed Saint-Foix, in his Historical Essays on Paris57 , teaches us that the bishop of Laon pronounced in 1120 the excommunication against caterpillars and field mice, because of the harm they did to crops.

On the part of the ecclesiastical tribunals, the custom of prosecuting insects or other animals injurious to the earth, and of fulminating excommunication against them, was in full force in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

Here are, in order of date, several sentences relating to our subject:

Sentence pronounced in 1451 by the official of Lausanne against the leeches of Lake Geneva58 .

Sentence rendered in Autun on Friday May 2, 1480 against hurebers (insects larger than flies), in favor of the inhabitants of Mussy and Pernan, by the vicars general of Antoine de Châlon, bishop of Autun, by which it is enjoined the priests to read it from the pulpit and to repeat the excommunication donec appareat effectus59 .

Sentence rendered against slugs on September 6, 1481 by Jehan Noseret, canon of Beaujeu, cantor of Mâcon and vicar general of Cardinal Philibert Hugonet, bishop of Mâcon, in which the example of Saint Mammet, bishop of Vienne, who conjured this way certain devils who had taken the form of wolves and pigs and who devoured the children even in the streets of the city60 .

Sentence of the grand vicars of Jean Rollin, cardinal bishop of Autun, given at Mâcon on August 17, 1487. Informed that the slugs have been devastating several lands of the diocese for more than a year, these vicars order the priests to make general processions for three days on their parishes, and to enjoin the slugs there to empty their territory within a similar time, if not to curse them61 .

Sentence of the grand vicars of Antoine Cabillon, bishop of Autun, given in Autun on May 2, 1488. At the request presented by several parishes around Beaune, the grand vicars instruct the priests to enjoin, during offices or processions , to the urebers to cease their ravages, or to excommunicate them62 .

Sentence of the Vicar General of the Church of Mâcon, given at Beaujeu on September 8, 1488, on the complaints of several parishioners. Same mandate to the priests to make three invitations to the slugs to cease their damage, and failing them to comply with this injunction, to excommunicate them63 .

Sentence of excommunication pronounced by the ecclesiastical judge in the first years of the sixteenth century, against the locusts and bruchids ( becmares ) who desolated the territory of Millière in Cotentin, and who from then on all perished64 .

Sentence of the official of Troyes in Champagne, July 9, 1516. "In this year the inhabitants of Villenauxe, in the diocese of Troyes, present a request to the official of this city, saying that they have been excessively inconvenienced for several years by caterpillars they called hurebets65 : Adversus bruchos seu erucas, vel alia non dissimilia ANIMALIA gallice hurebets . This ecclesiastical judge first orders, on the conclusions of the promoter, an information and a descent of commissioners, who recognized that the damage caused by the animals of which one complained was very considerable: on what first ordinance which enjoins the inhabitants to correct their manners. Soon a new request in which they promise to lead a better conduct. Second order of the official, which enjoins the hurebetsto withdraw within six days from the vineyards and territories of Villenauxe, even from the whole diocese of Troyes, with a declaration that if within the prescribed term they do not obey, they are declared cursed and excommunicated. Moreover, enjoins the inhabitants to implore the help of heaven, to abstain from any crime, and to pay without fraud the customary tithes.66 . »
