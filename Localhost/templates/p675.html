The occasion permits me to glance but briefly at the events of that war which to some are still vivid memories,[Pg 4] while others must either glean them from the historic page or hear them recited by the men who then acted history.

That war had its origin in the invasion of the soil of the United States by the Army of Mexico.

On January 10th, 1845, the Congress of the United States passed an Act providing for the annexation of Texas.

The Act was ratified by the Congress of that Republic on July 4th, 1845, and Texas with its two hundred and sixty five thousand square miles of territory, an area greater than that of the German Empire or of Austria, thus became an integral part of the American Union.

Texas had already maintained her independence for ten years against Mexico, the parent country.

Those who have questioned the political morality of the act of annexation may be fully answered by reference to the fact that England, France and Spain had all formally recognized the independence of the Republic of Texas three years before her admission into our Union. Mexico resolved to nullify that act by force of arms.

In view of her aggressive attitude, Major General Zachary Taylor, U. S. Army, was ordered to the Rio Grande, the Western boundary of Texas, with a force of about four thousand men, chiefly regulars, where he arrived July 20th, 1845, establishing his headquarters at Corpus Christi, within four miles of the Mexican Army, then encamped ten thousand strong, under the command of General Ampudia, on the South side of that river. In January, 1846, General Taylor moved his command to a point opposite Matamoras, Mexico, and erected an earthwork which he termed Fort Brown.

On the 24th of April, 1846, Captain Thornton, U. S. Army, while marching at the head of seventy men of the 2nd Dragoons in Texas, fell into an ambuscade of Mexican regular troops, numbering between three and four hundred, and after a gallant resistance, during which he had sixteen of his command killed, and thirty-eight wounded, was obliged to surrender. Six days later the Mexican forces attacked Fort Brown, and were handsomely repulsed. On May 8th General[Pg 5] Taylor with 2,300 men met and defeated the Mexican Army 6,000 strong, under the command of Generals Ampudia and Arista, at Palo Alto. On the following day, the Mexican Army having received a reinforcement of 1,000 men, made a stand at Resaca de la Palma (Ravine of Palms) and was there again defeated by General Taylor, the Mexican loss being 975 and ours but 110 killed and wounded.

It is a noteworthy fact that those battles were fought without a declaration of war on either side. Indeed no declaration of war was ever made by either of the two contending Republics.

On May 13th, 1846, the Congress of the United States passed a resolution declaring that war existed between the United Stales and Mexico, and further resolved, that the war should be prosecuted, until we obtained “indemnity for the past, and security for the future.”

In response to the call of the President (Jas. K. Polk) for thirty thousand volunteers, sixty-five thousand volunteered promptly. The quotas furnished by the respective States were as follows:

Alabama 2,981, Maryland and district of Columbia 1,372, Arkansas 1,274, Florida 289, Missouri 6,441, Georgia 1,987, North Carolina 895, Illinois 5,791, South Carolina 1,120, Indiana 4,329, Ohio 5,334, Iowa 229, New Jersey 420, Kentucky 4,094, New York 1,890, Louisiana 7,341, Pennsylvania 2,117, Michigan 1,072, Tennessee 5,392, Massachusetts 930, Texas 7,394, Mississippi 2,235, Wisconsin 146.

To these must be added about seven thousand regulars of the United States Army, and one thousand marines, making an aggregate force of about seventy-three thousand rank and file, constituting that gallant army, charged with the duty in connection with our grand old historic navy of enforcing from Mexico “indemnity for the past and security for the future.”

That demand, history attests, they translated into action.

The Republic of Mexico consisted of twenty-four states, with a population of about six millions. It had but twenty[Pg 6] years previously achieved its independence against the veteran army of Spain.

It had a standing army of fifty thousand, and had called into the field an additional force, chiefly volunteers, of nearly two hundred thousand.

Her soldiers were well armed and equipped, the muskets of her infantry all bearing the English Tower-stamp, and the cartridges being of the best British manufacture. Her troops were, in the main, magnificently uniformed, and we could say with literal truth that her “Cohorts were gleaming with purple and gold.” Her coast defences were provided with good armaments, her principal sea-port, Vera-Cruz, being guarded by the Castle of San Juan d’Ulloa, built of white coral rock, and mounting three hundred heavy guns. No country was better adapted by its topography for defensive warfare.

Abounding with mountain ranges, and rocky hill-slopes, the true citadels of freedom, that commanded all practicable roads to the interior, while she had a formidable ally in the deadly climate of her coast, where the tropical sun, shining upon the ever-decaying masses of rank vegetation, breeds the fatal malaria which burns up the blood with fever, alternating with the icy “norther” that within an hour will often vary the temperature from summer’s heat to an almost Arctic cold.

Three lines of operation against Mexico were now determined on:

1. General Taylor was to operate from Matamoras, along the line of the Rio-Grande.

2. A column under General Kearny was to conquer the Mexican territories of New Mexico and California.

3. A column under General Wool was to enter the Northern States of Mexico and conquer Chihuahua, and the adjacent country.

In pursuance of this plan General Taylor advanced upon the Mexican Array, then in position at Monterey, on September 5th, 1846.

[Pg 7]

His army numbered 6,600 of all arms, composed of 3,200 regular troops of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, and 8th, infantry; 4 companies of the 2nd Dragoons, and 5 batteries (30) guns of field artillery, and 3,400 volunteers, consisting of the first regiments from Kentucky, Mississipi, Ohio and Tennessee, two Texas regiments commanded by Brig. Gen. Henderson, including Jack Hay’s famous Texas Rangers, and one battalion from Maryland and the District of Columbia.

The Mexican force consisted of 7,000 regulars and 3,500 volunteers, with 84 pieces of artillery in strong works covering every approach to the city. Their principal works were designated as Forts Diabolo, Teneria, Soldado, Independence, the Bishop’s Palace and the Citadel.

Our army attacked in three divisions, commanded respectively by Generals Worth, Twiggs and Butler of Kentucky.

The enemy made a desperate resistance. The firing was incessant from the windows and flat roofs of the dwellings, and from barricades in the streets when our troops had entered the city after carrying all the outer defences by assault.

The attack began on September 20th, and ended on the morning of the 23rd, with the surrender of the enemy. Our loss was about 950 killed and wounded.

Early in December, 1846, all of the regular infantry was withdrawn from General Taylor’s army and ordered to report to Major-General Winfield Scott, the Commander-in-Chief, who had assumed command in person of the fourth great column of attack, whose objective point was the Capital of Mexico, and which was entitled, “The Army of Mexico.” General Taylor’s army was thus reduced to only 4,500 men consisting altogether of volunteers, except three batteries of the regular army, and two squadrons of the 2nd Dragoons. Its numerical weakness invited attack, and General Santa Anna, the most renowned and skilful of the Mexican Commanders, and President of the Republic of Mexico, who had won a decisive victory over the French Army of invasion nine years before, moved his army against it. That army, according to the Mexican official reports,[Pg 8] numbered twenty three thousand, two-thirds regular soldiers.

General Taylor decided to accept battle, and selected a position admirably adapted for defence at the Rancho Buena Vista. The position was marked by narrow defiles, and rugged and high ridges, that commanded the valley below. The battle began at daylight on February 23rd, 1846, by the attack of the enemy in force on our left flank. It was gallantly repulsed by the fire of the second and 3rd Indiana Riflemen, and a company of Col. Yell’s dismounted Arkansas Cavalry, with Bragg’s and Shermann’s splendidly served batteries, diverged to our left, where the enemy was concentrating for a decisive attack. The extreme left of our line was posted on a high and broad plateau and was composed of the 2nd Indiana, and 2nd Illinois regiments of infantry.

The tremendous impact of that attack forced those regiments to retire in considerable disorder after they had sustained for some time a severe cross-fire of artillery, and a heavy fire on their front, by a greatly superior force of infantry. At that crisis of the battle the 1st Mississipi Rifles, the only regiment of that army that was armed with rifles having percussion locks, commanded by Colonel Jefferson Davis, promptly interposed between the retreating regiments, and the charging Mexican cavalry, and doubtless saved the day by their rapid and effective firing, before which the enemy recoiled. There are veterans of Buena Vista, who, though in after years they still remained true to the flag of their country, and struck in its just defence on fields “shot-sown and bladed thick with steel,” do not feel that they sully their loyalty in respectfully saluting Jefferson Davis, as he was, recalling him to memory as with tall heroic form he so gallantly upheld the starry ensign of the Union upon the steady and blazing line that sheltered the brave but broken columns of Illinois and Indiana, from the uplifted sabres of a merciless foe.

The art of dying at the right time is the art preservative of great reputations.

The Mississipi Rifles were soon bravely supported by the 1st Illinois, 2nd Indiana, and 2nd Kentucky regiments with section (2 pieces) of Bragg’s famous battery, and the ground[Pg 9] lost on our left flank was in great part recovered. At the base of the ridge the left flank of the enemy was held in check by Indiana and Arkansas infantry, and the destructive fire of our artillery.

At that moment, when his army had met with a disastrous and demoralizing repulse, General Santa Anna sent forward a flag of truce and our fire was suspended. The bearer of the flag, to the amazement of General Taylor, presented a demand for the surrender of his army.

This expedient cannot be too strongly commended in the art of war, although writers upon grand strategy have strangely overlooked it. It is not suggested even by General Jomini, in his exhaustive work “Traité des grandes Opérations Militaires.”

It may, however, be thus formulated: When your attacking columns are shattered and repulsed, hurry up a flag of truce, and check the advance of your exultant enemy, and demand his surrender, and then, before he can recover from his astonishment at your sublime impudence reform your shattered lines and advance to further vantage ground, or retire in good order, under the shelter of the peaceful symbol.

Santa Anna’s messenger returned with General Taylor’s laconic answer, “I decline acceding to your demand,” and the Mexicans again advanced to the attack, bringing into action all their reserves, and were again repulsed with heavy loss, after a terrible struggle.

The battle of twelve sanguinary hours on that mountain plateau had ended, and “our flag was still there.”

General Santa Anna retired rapidly with his army, only pausing in the vicinity long enough to send off a bulletin to the Capital announcing that he had “won a decisive victory over the barbarians of the North.” Thus ended in a blaze of glory the battle-record of the “army of occupation,” under General Taylor.

In the meantime, the Army of the West, under the command of General Stephen W. Kearney, had been reaping a rich harvest of laurels.

[Pg 10]

By a rapid march from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to Santa Fé, a distance of 750 miles in thirty days, he secured possession of New Mexico.

Dividing his force (2,500) at Santa Fé, General Kearney with 1,500 Dragoons marched to California, and defeated the enemy in a warm engagement at San Pasqual. He then formed a junction with the California rifle battalion, and a force of 750 sailors and marines from the naval squadron, under the command of Commodore Stockton, who had just succeeded the gallant Commodore Sloat, who had previously taken the California port of Monterey. Prior to the arrival of General Kearney, however, that brilliant soldier, and untiring and sagacious explorer, John C. Fremont, had hoisted the American standard in California. He was there under orders to ascertain and lay out a new route to Oregon further South than that travelled by our emigrants.

The Mexican Governor of California having in May, 1846, ordered all American settlers to leave that province, and having raised a force to expel them, Colonel Fremont recruited a body of 400 men and defeated the Mexicans in several sharp engagements in the valley of the Sacramento, before he had even heard that war existed between the United States and Mexico. Under his able and enterprising leadership the Americans in California, united with many of the natives, declared the independence of the province of California on the 4th of July, 1845.

It has since transpired that but for this timely action on the part of Col. Fremont and the resolute Americans associated with him, a large force would have been landed from the British fleet in that vicinity, and California would have been taken possession of by England, under an arrangement with its Mexican Governor.It had been taken possession of by Admiral Drake for England in the year 1579, under the name of “New Albion,” and the vague British claim was to be revived in the interest of English capitalists who held the bonds of Mexico to the amount of one hundred and fifty millions of dollars.

A few months after these stirring and important events on[Pg 11] the Pacific slope, Col. A. W. Doniphan began his famous march from Santa Fé to Saltillo.

He started on November 13th, 1846, with a force consisting of nine hundred Missouri cavalry and two batteries of Missouri artillery. A part of his command 500 strong was attacked on Christmas Day at Brazito by a force of 1,000 Mexicans, which they defeated in twenty minutes. They again defeated the enemy on February 28th, 1847, at Sacramento, near the city of Chihuahua, and entered that important city triumphantly. On the next day Doniphan began his march through the Northern States of Mexico, back to Saltillo. He accomplished this renowned march, winning victories as he went, in forty days, a distance of 1,500 miles. This dims the lustre of the retreat of the ten thousand Greeks from the field of Cunaxa, as graphically described by Xenophon, their commander and historian.

While these events were in progress, Col. Sterling Price, of Missouri, who had been left by Doniphan at Santa Fé, with a force of about 500 men, had been, as he always was, active and successful.

On January 19th, 1847, Governor Charles Bent, with thirty-five other Americans were massacred at Taos, New Mexico, in cold blood by a Mexican force of about two thousand cavalry, which soon after appeared in the vicinity of Santa Fé. Price attacked and defeated them, after a desperate conflict, at Canada, about 18 miles north of Santa Fé. He pursued them on their retreat, and two days later inflicted severe loss upon them at Embedo, and finally on February 4th he utterly routed them at Taos, the scene of their recent savage atrocity.

The scene now opens on a broader field of action.

On the 9th of March, 1847, the Army of Mexico, under the command of Major-General Winfield Scott, that most regal of American soldiers, never to be named by us, comrades, but with uplifted hat, began its victorious march for the “Halls of the Montezumas.” General Scott on that day effected the landing of his army at Sacrificios, an island seven miles west of Vera Cruz. The landing was made in seventy-five surf[Pg 12] boats, each carrying seventy-five men, under cover of our fleet, commanded by Commodore Conner, with those able and dashing officers Commodores Perry and Tatnall commanding squadrons of the fleet. The army there numbered 13,200 rank and file. General Scott established his lines on the north and east fronts of Vera Cruz on the same day. Within ten days he had planted five large siege batteries built of sand bags about 1,000 yards from the walls of the city. One of them was mounted with 8-inch ship guns, and manned by sailors from the fleet.

A demand for the surrender of the city having been made and refused, our guns opened fire on March 22nd, and for three days and nights rained upon it the red ruin of avenging war. On the morning of the 25th, General Laudero, commanding the garrison of the city and the Castle of San Juan d’Ulloa, sent in a flag of truce with overtures of surrender. He at first proposed to surrender the city alone. General Scott refused this, as the castle distant but a mile to the South East of the city, completely commanded it, and he therefore demanded its surrender also.

This demand was finally acceded to and the surrender of the Castle of San Juan d’Ulloa, and the City of Vera Cruz, with their garrisons 8,000 strong was formally made on March 29, 1847. Our loss was but sixteen killed and wounded.

On April 8th our army took up its line of march along the national road for the Capital of Mexico distant 290 miles. On April 14th it confronted the Army of Santa Anna, 20,000 strong posted on the heights of Cerro Gordo. The mountain ridges on which he had taken position, had been well fortified by that indomitable but cruel and faithless Mexican general, and fully commanded our route to the Capital. At the instance, and under the direction of that most excellent soldier Captain Robert E. Lee, of the Corps of Engineers, a road was cut through the dense forest on the enemy’s left, so as to enable us to take his position in reverse. This work occupied three days during which our working parties were frequently attacked.

[Pg 13]

On the morning of the 18th of April, at dawn, we attacked in force.

The command of our column of attack on the enemy’s left was the post of honor, for it was the strongest point of his position, as it covered his only line of retreat. That command was assigned to Brigadier General James Shields, one of that warlike Irish race who have ever keenly felt the rapture of the fight wherever battle was to be done for a noble cause—a most knightly and heroic soldier, who would have worn with stainless honor the white plume of Henry of Navarre on the field of Ivry, and have worthily led the immortal Irish Brigade along the path of glory that it trod at Fontenoy.

Our troops dashed up the mountain side with unquailing intrepidity, the First Regiment of New York, volunteers of Shield’s brigade under the command of that most gallant soldier Colonel Ward B. Burnett, bravely leading on our extreme right. The rocky ridge was soon ablaze with the fire of musketry and artillery.

In three hours the Mexican Army was routed. The battle was done, and far up on the crest of the mountain range where the eagle dwells alone, the white stars of our country’s banner shone serenely on their blue field. Our loss was 97 killed and 408 wounded, and that of the enemy about 1,400 in killed and wounded, and 2,750 prisoners, among whom were officers and men of the recently surrendered garrison of Vera Cruz, who were serving against us in violation of their paroles.

Harney’s Dragoons pursued the enemy hotly, and sabred their scattered columns for fifteen miles along the road to Jalapa.

At that city the army of Scott was reduced to about 6,500 by the muster out of the greater part of his volunteer forces, as they had enlisted for only one year; and their term of service had expired. Leaving Jalapa on the 22nd of April we entered Peroté and its strong castle, a full bastion work of 80 guns, on the evening of the 23rd, the enemy having evacuated it on approach. Halting here to rest for about[Pg 14] two weeks we marched for Puebla, 70 miles distant, the chief manufacturing city in Mexico with a population of 65,000.We occupied Puebla on May 15th, after a desultory fire from the enemy in its streets.

Here General Scott was obliged to await, for nearly three months, the arrival of reinforcements. Every day’s delay increased our hazard, as the enemy was fortifying, along all the approaches to the capital.

The time was not wholly lost, however, for General Scott there brought the drill of his volunteer regiments to the highest state of perfection, so that they marched and manœuvred with all the precision of trained regulars.

At length the long-expected reinforcements arrived, and on the morning of August 7th, 1847, our Army moved out of Puebla on its march for the city of Mexico, all our bands playing the Star Spangled Banner.

It numbered then about 10,000 men, consisting of four divisions.

The cavalry was commanded by that redoubtable soldier, the Murat of the Army, Brt. Brig. Genl. Wm. S. Harney, and consisted of detachments of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Dragoons, to the number of about seven hundred and fifty.

After a toilsome march of about seventy miles, across mountain spurs and along a very rugged road, the army, on the afternoon of August 17th, 1847, looked down for the first time on the valley of Mexico, and saw from afar its magnificent capital, with the golden crosses of its churches glittering in the red light of the setting sun. There lay before us the same broad lake, mirroring the same snow-crowned mountains in its glassy bosom, on which Cortez with his steel-clad warriors had gazed, in the same month, three hundred and twenty six years before. On reaching a point about nine miles from the city, General Scott ascertained by a reconnaissance that the Mexicans had fortified El Peñón, a mountain that commanded the approach to the capital by the National road. He therefore ordered a counter march with the view to turn the lake (Chalco) on the south. This required[Pg 15] a march of twenty five miles, which was rapidly made, and on the 18th, the army was concentrated at a point about ten miles from the city at Contreras, a strong position held by General Valencia, with field-works mounting twenty-four guns. These, General Scott determined to take in reverse, and we therefore made a night march of eight miles over the pedregal or lava fields, a route deemed by the Mexicans impracticable for any army. The assault was made on the rear and flanks of the surprised enemy soon after daylight on August 20th, by Riley’s Cadivalders and Shield’s Brigades, all under the command of General P. F. Smith, whom General Shields, although ranking above him, magnanimously allowed to retain the command that he might carry out dispositions made prior to the arrival of Shields on the ground.

The whole line of works was stormed, and the battle won in eighteen minutes.

The enemy broke at the first assault, and fled in the direction of the city, and nearly five hundred of them were captured by the New York Volunteers and the Palmetto regiment, that were posted to cut off their retreat. At this battle two guns of the 4th Artillery, that were lost without dishonor at Buena Vista, were recaptured from the enemy.

The army, after resting a few hours at St. Augustine, a town about four miles from Contreras, marched against the main body of the enemy, distant six miles from the former point.

We were soon in the presence of the Mexican Army, thirty thousand strong, commanded by Santa Anna, and composed of the best troops of Mexico, including several thousand volunteers. It occupied a vast intrenched camp near the village and convent of Churubusco, about seven miles from the capital.

While marching to this field we heard a number of heavy explosions which we soon learned were due to the blowing up of the bridges along all our possible lines of retreat back to the coast.
