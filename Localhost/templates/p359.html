f a handy-book of electricity like this had fallen into the hands of Thomas A. Edison when he was a newsboy on the Grand Trunk Railway, or when he was a telegraph operator, he would have devoured it with the utmost eagerness. To be sure, at that time, in the early sixties, all that we knew of electricity and its applications could have been told in a very brief compass. It was an almost unknown field, and the crude form of the telegraph then in use represented its most important application. There were no electric lights; there was no telephone or phonograph; there were no electric motors. Telegraphing, itself, was a slow and difficult process. All the conditions were as far removed as possible from the broad field of applied electricity indicated in this book.

But this does not mean that we have now accomplished all that there is to be done. On the contrary, the next half-century will be full of wonderful advances. This makes it more than ever essential that we should become acquainted with the principles and present conditions of a science which is being applied more and more closely to the work of every-day life. It is necessary to know this from the inside, not simply from general descriptions. Theory is all very well, but there is nothing like mastering principles, and then applying them and working out results for one’s self.[xii] Any active and intelligent boy with an inquiring mind will find a new world opened to him in the satisfaction of making electrical devices for himself according to the suggestions given in this book. This will show him the reasons for things in concrete form, will familiarize him with principles, and will develop his mechanical ingenuity. He may be laying the foundation for inventions of his own or for professional success in some of the many fields which electricity now offers. Work of this kind brings out what is in one, and there is no satisfaction greater than that of winning success by one’s own efforts.

The boy who makes a push-button for his own home, or builds his own telephone line or wireless telegraph plant, or by his own ingenuity makes electricity run his mother’s sewing-machine and do other home work, has learned applications of theory which he will never forget. The new world which he will enter is a modern fairyland of science, for in the use of electricity he has added to himself the control of a powerful genie, a willing and most useful servant, who will do his errands or provide new playthings, who will give him manual training and a vast increase in general knowledge. The contents of this book, ranging from the preparation of simple cells to the making of dynamos and motors, and the delightful possibilities of electro-plating, shows the richness of the field which is made accessible by Mr. Adams’ practical explanations, his carefully tested working plans, and his numerous and admirable drawings—all of which have been made for this book.

It is in keeping with the practical character of the Electricity Book that pains are taken throughout to show the[xiii] simplest and most inexpensive way of choosing materials and securing results. The actual working out of these directions can be done at very small expense. Furthermore, there need be no concern whatever as to possible danger if the book is read with reasonable intelligence. Mr. Adams has taken pains to place danger-signals wherever special precautions are advisable, and, as a father of boys who are constantly working with electricity in his laboratory, he may be relied upon as a safe and sure counsellor and guide.

While this book shows boys what they can do themselves, its scope has been enlarged by Mr. Baker’s chapter explaining briefly the working of electricity all about us, in light and heat, in the trolley-car, and other daily applications. In addition, Mr. Adams has prepared a Dictionary of Electrical Terms, and these brief definitions will be found peculiarly helpful in the first reading of the book. It is believed that there is no book in this particular field comparable to Harper’s Electricity Book in its comprehensiveness, practical character, and the number and usefulness of its illustrations. It follows the successful Out-door Book for Boys in Harper’s series of Practical Books for Boys, and it will be followed by How to Understand Electrical Work, a book, not of instructions in making electrical apparatus, but of explanations of the commercial uses of electricity all about us.

ELECTRICITY BOOK FOR BOYS

Chapter I
SOME GENERAL EXPLANATIONS
We are living in the age of electricity, just as our fathers lived in the age of steam. Electricity is the world-power, the most powerful and terrible of nature’s hidden forces. Yet, when man has learned how to harness its fiery energies, electricity becomes the most docile and useful of his servants. Unquestionably, electricity is to-day the most fascinating and the most profitable field for the investigator and the inventor. The best brains of the country are at work upon its problems. New discoveries are constantly being recorded, and no labor is thought too great if it but add its mite to the sum total of our knowledge. And yet, ridiculous as the statement may seem, we do not know what electricity is. We only know certain of its manifestations—what it can do. All we can say is that it does our bidding; it propels our trains, lights our houses and streets, warms us, cooks for us, and performs a thousand and one other tasks at the turn of a button or at the thrust of a switch. But what it is, we do not know. Electricity has[4] no weight, no bulk, no color. No one has seen it; it cannot be classified, nor analyzed, nor resolved into its ultimate elements by any known process of science. We must content ourselves with describing it as one manifestation of the energy which fills the universe and appears in a variety of forms—such as heat, light, magnetism, chemical affinity, and mechanical motion. In all probability it is one of those phenomena of nature that are destined to remain forever secret. Thus it stands in line with gravitation, magnetism, the active principle of radium, and the perpetual motion of the solar system.

Electricity was known to the early Greeks; indeed, it derives its name from the Greek word for amber (electron). For many centuries amber was credited with certain special or magical powers. When it was rubbed with a flannel cloth, “the hidden spirit” came out and laid hold of small detached objects, such as bits of paper, thread, chips, or pith-balls. No one could explain this phenomenon. It was looked upon with superstitious awe and the amber itself was regarded as possessing the special attributes of divinity. But as time went on, it was discovered that in various other substances this mysterious attractive power could be excited, at will, through the agency of friction. Rubbing a piece of glass rod with silk or leather generated an “electricity” identical with that of the amber; or the same result could be obtained by exciting hard rubber with catskin. The conclusion followed that electricity was not a property of the special materials employed to generate it, but that it came from without, from that great reservoir of energy, the atmosphere. Then came Franklin with his experiment[5] of the kite, and the invention of the Leyden-jar and the chemical production of the electric fluid by means of batteries. It was shown that the properties of the new and strange force were the same, whether it was produced by the static (frictional) process or by the galvanic (chemical) method. Electrical science as a science, had begun.

And yet, for many years, electricity was hardly more than a scientific toy. It was not supposed to possess any practical usefulness. The entertaining experiments with the static machine and the Leyden-jar (chapter xiii.) were confined to the laboratory and the lecture hall. Electricity was an amusing display of unknown energy, but no one ever dreamed that it could ever be made to serve the practical ends of life. It was not until about 1850 that electrical science became anything more than a name. The galvanic and voltaic batteries (chapter ii.) opened the way for “current” electricity, which flowed continuously, instead of jumping and disappearing like the spark from a Leyden-jar. When the continuous current became an established fact, the telegraph and telephone headed the line of a long series of developments. Finally, the generation of electricity in greater volume, and cheaply, made possible the application of its power for heating, light, traction, and the other forms of activity in which it now does so large a share of the world’s work.

How electricity works is a question often asked, but not easily answered. There are certain so-called laws, but we shall best arrive at a conclusion by simply stating a few of the facts that have been established through the observation[6] and investigation of scientists and electrical engineers.[1]

[1]Explanations of any technical names or phrases used in the text will be found in the simple dictionary of electrical terms which appears as an appendix.

For example, electricity is always alert, ready to move, and continually on the lookout for a chance to obtain its freedom. It will never go the longest way round if there is a short cut; and it will heat, light, or fuse anything in its path that is too weak to carry or resist it. For this reason, it must be generated in small volume—that is, just sufficient to do the work required of it. If produced in larger volume, it must be held in check by resistance, and only so much allowed to escape as may be needed for the specified work.

Again, when electricity is generated this must be done in one of two ways—by friction or chemically. But in both processes there must be air surrounding the generators, and the fluid must be of a nature through which oxygen and hydrogen can circulate freely. Water fluids are suitable for this purpose, but oils cannot be used, as they contain hydro-carbon in large quantities and are non-conductors.

Batteries are chemical generators, dynamos are magneto-electric, and static machines are frictional. Now the theory is that electricity is drawn from the ether and, in its normal state, is quiet. If it be disturbed and collected by mechanical or chemical means, it is always on the alert to escape and again take its place in the atmosphere. As its volume is increased, so its energy to get away is multiplied, and this energy may be transformed, at will, into power, heat, or light. To express the idea in the simplest language,[7] it wants to go home, and in its effort to do so it expresses itself in the form of stored-up power, precisely like water behind a dam. It is for man’s cunning brain to devise all sorts of tasks that this power must perform before it can gain its release. It can’t go home until its work is done.

Nearly every boy has experimented, at one time or another, with electricity and electrical apparatus, and whether it was with some of the simple frictional or galvanic toys, or with the more complicated induction-coils and motors, he has undoubtedly found it a most interesting amusement and an ever new and widening field for study. Then again, many boys would like to know something about simple electrical apparatus and how to make and use it. But his school-books relating to the general subject of electricity are hardly definite enough to serve as a practical manual. And yet there are many things in the way of electrical machinery and equipment that a boy can easily construct and use. In this book it is my purpose to show him just what can be done with the aid of the tools that are usually in his possession. While some things may have to be purchased from an electrical supply-house or other sources, there is still much material to be found about the house that may be put to good use by the amateur electrician.

It is not possible or desirable to describe every variety of electrical equipment. We must confine ourselves to apparatus which can be readily understood and operated. The “practical” idea is the one to be borne in mind. This book shows a boy how to use his brains and the simple tools and material that may be at his command. Care and thought in the construction of the apparatus are the important[8] qualifications for success. The instructions are given in the clearest possible language; the diagrams and drawings are intelligible to any one who will take the trouble to study them. If your finished apparatus does not work properly, read the description again and see if you have not made some error. A misplaced or broken wire, a wrong connection, or a short circuit will mean all the difference between success and failure.

Save in one short chapter, static or frictional electricity (see Appendix) is not considered; for outside of laboratory experimenting and electro-medical apparatus, frictional electricity is but a toy—interesting and useful when generated in small volume, but very dangerous and difficult of control when in great volume. For example, the bolt of lightning is but the many times multiplied spark stored in the Leyden-jar by the static machine. For all practical purposes, galvanic electricity, in its various phases of direct and alternating current, meets the requirements of man. With the improved apparatus and the rapid advancement along the line of invention, electricity is as easily controlled to-day as steam—in fact, its economical use is even more fully under control and its adaptability more practical.

In the following pages there are probably illustrations and descriptions of many things that will seem strange to the boy who has not heard of them; but if a book were written each year on the subject of electricity, every new one would include principles and facts not known before. The field of electrical research is so broad and so many are working in it that new discoveries are being made continually.

[9]

To those familiar with the application of electricity, it is clearly evident that, as yet, we are only beginning to deal with this unknown force. For generations to come, developments will take place and invention follow invention until electricity assumes its rightful place as the motive force of the world. To the boy interested in this subject a wide field is open, and the youth of to-day, who are taking up this study, are destined to become the successful electrical engineers and inventors of the future. There is no better education for any boy, in the application and principles of electricity, than to begin at the very bottom of the ladder and climb up, constructing and studying as he progresses. When he attempts to design more technical and difficult apparatus the lessons learned in a practical way will be of inestimable value, greater by far than any theoretical principles deduced from books; he knows his subject from the ground up; he understands his machine because he has constructed it with his own hands.

As I have said already, the necessary tools are few in number and not expensive. They may include a hammer, a plane, awls, pliers, wire-cutters, and tin-shears. The raw material is also cheap—lead, tin, wire, wood, and simple chemicals. The laboratory may be a corner in the attic, or even in a boy’s bedroom, so far as the finer work is concerned, while the hammering and sawing may be done in the cellar. The other best plan, of course, is to get the use of a spare room which may be fitted with shelves, drawers, and appliances for serious work. To enthusiastic beginners, as well as to those who have had some experience in electricity, a needed warning may be given in three words:[10] “Take no chances.” Electricity, the subtle, stealthy, and ever-alert force, will often deal a blow when least expected. For that reason, a boy should never meddle with a high-tension current or with the mains from dynamos. The current in the house, used for lighting, cooking, or heating purposes, is always an attractive point for the young electrician, but the wires should never be touched in any way. Too many accidents have happened, and the conductors, lamp-sockets, and plugs should be carefully avoided.

The boy should keep strictly to his batteries, or small dynamos run by water-power from a faucet; in no case should the wire from power-houses be tampered with. One little knows what a current it may be carrying and what a death-dealing force it possesses. Always bear in mind that a naked wire falling from a trolley equipment carries enough force to kill anything it strikes.

Special attention is called to the dictionary of electrical terms given in the Appendix. The young student should never pass over a word or a term that he does not thoroughly understand. Always look it up at once and every time it occurs, until you are sure that its meaning is fixed in your mind. This is an education in itself, at least so far as the theoretical knowledge of our subject is concerned.

As a final word, I should like every boy interested in electricity to hear what Thomas A. Edison once said to me when I was a boy working in his laboratories. I often recall it when things do not go just right at first.

I asked the great inventor one day if invention was not made up largely of inspiration. He looked at me quizzically for a moment, and then replied: “My boy, I have little use[11] for a man who works on inspiration. Invention is two parts inspiration and ninety-eight per cent. perspiration.”

You will never get what you are after unless you work hard for it. You must stick to it until you produce results. If the history of the world’s most valuable inventions could be fully known, the fact would be clearly established that the vital spark of inspiration is but the starting-point. Then follow the days, weeks, and sometimes years of industrious toil, failures, and disappointments, until finally the desired end is attained. One must work for success; there is no other means of winning it.

As the table of contents shows, Part I. of this book explains principles and the simpler forms of electrical appliances. From this we advance to Part II., which deals with more complex forms of electrical work, most of which, however, are within the reach of intelligent boys who have followed the chapters carefully from the first. In a final chapter we have simple explanations of the great commercial uses of electricity, which we see all about us, although very few of us have a clear idea as to their operation.

Chapter II
CELLS AND BATTERIES
Simple Cells
In order to generate electricity it is necessary to employ cells, batteries, or dynamos. Since the construction and operation of a dynamo is somewhat intricate, it will be better to start with the simpler methods of electric generation, and so work up to the more complicated forms. For small apparatus, such as electric bells and light magnets and motors, the zinc-carbon-sal-ammoniac cell will answer very well; but for larger machinery, where more current is required, the bluestone and the bi-chromate batteries will be found necessary.


SIMPLE BATTERY ELEMENTS

A simple and inexpensive cell may be made from electric-light carbons, with the copper coating removed, and pencils of zinc, such as are used for electric-bell batteries and which can be purchased for five cents each. Copper wire is to be bound around the top of each pencil of carbon and zinc, and firmly fastened with the pliers, so that it will not pull off or become detached. It will be well to cut a groove with a file around the top of both the carbon and zinc, into which the wire will fit. The elements should then be[13-
14] clamped between two pieces of wood and held with screws, as shown in Fig. 1. A more efficient carbon pole is made by strapping six or more short carbon pencils around one long one, as shown in Fig. 3. The short pieces of electric-light carbons are bound to the longest carbon with heavy elastic bands, or cotton string dipped in paraffine or wax, to make the cotton impervious to water and the sal-ammoniac solution.

Another arrangement of elements is shown in Fig. 2, where a zinc rod is suspended between two carbons, the carbons being connected by a wire that must not touch the zinc.

A fruit-jar, or a wide-necked pickle-bottle, may be employed for a cell, but before the solution is poured in, the upper edge of the glass should be coated with paraffine. This should be melted and applied with a brush, or the edge of the glass dipped in the paraffine.

The solution is made by dissolving four ounces of sal-ammoniac in a pint of water, and the jar should be filled three-fourths full. In this solution the carbons and zinc may be suspended, as shown in the illustration (Fig. 4) of the sal-ammoniac cell. The wood clamps keep the carbon and zinc together, and the extending ends rest on the top of the jar and hold the poles in suspension. Plates of zinc and carbon may be clamped on either side of a square stick and suspended in the sal-ammoniac solution, as shown in Fig. 5, taking care, however, that the screws used for clamping do not touch each other.

If one cell is not sufficiently powerful, several of them may be made and coupled up in series—that is, by carrying[15] the wire from the zinc of one to the carbon of the next cell, and so on to the end, taking care that the wire from the carbon in the first cell and that from the zinc of the last cell will be the ones in hand, as shown in Fig. 6. This constitutes a battery. Be sure and keep the ends of the wire apart, to prevent galvanic action and to save the power of the batteries.

This battery is an excellent one for bells and small experimental work, and when inactive the zincs are not eaten away (as they would be if suspended in a bi-chromate solution), for corrosion takes place only as the electricity is required, or when the circuit is closed. A series of batteries of this description will last about twelve months, if used for a bell, and at the end of that time will only require a new zinc and fresh solution.

The cell in which the plates shown in Fig. 5 are used may contain a bi-chromate solution; and for experimental work, where electricity is required for a short time only, this will produce a stronger current. But remember that the solution eats the zinc rapidly, and the plates must be removed as soon as you have finished using them.

The bi-chromate solution is made by slowly pouring four ounces of commercial sulphuric acid into a quart of cold water. This should be done in an earthen jar, since the heat generated by adding acid to water is enough to crack a glass bottle. Never pour the water into the acid. When the solution is about cold, add four ounces of bi-chromate of potash, and shake or mix it occasionally until dissolved; then place it in a bottle and label it:

[16]

BI-CHROMATE BATTERY FLUID
POISON

Before the zincs are immersed in the bi-chromate solution they should be well amalgamated to prevent the acid from eating them too rapidly.

The amalgamating is done by immersing the zincs in a diluted solution of sulphuric acid for a few seconds, and then rubbing mercury (quicksilver) on the surfaces. The mercury will adhere to the chemically cleaned surfaces of any metal except iron and steel, and so prevent the corroding action of the acid. Do not get on too much mercury, but only enough to give the zinc a thin coat, so that it will present a silvery or shiny surface.

A two-fluid cell is made with an outer glass or porcelain jar and an inner porous cup through which the current can pass when the cup is wet. Fig. 7.

Batteries
Batteries
A porous cup is an unglazed earthen receptacle, similar to a flower-pot, through which moisture will pass slowly. The porous cup contains an amalgamated plate of zinc immersed in a solution of diluted sulphuric acid—one ounce to one pint of water. The outer cell contains a saturated solution of sulphate of copper in which a cylindrical piece of thin sheet-copper is held by a thin copper strap, bent over the edge of the outer cell. A few lumps or crystals of the copper sulphate, or bluestone, should be dropped to the bottom of the jar to keep the copper solution saturated at all times. When not in use, the zinc should be removed from the inner cell and washed off; and if the battery is not to be employed for several days, it would be well to[17] pour the solutions back into bottles and wash the several parts of the battery, so that it may be fresh and strong when next required. When in action, the solutions in both cups should be at the same level, and be careful never to allow the solutions to get mixed or the copper solution to touch the zinc. Coat the top of the porous cell with paraffine[18] to prevent crystallization, and also to keep it clean. Take great care, in handling the acid solutions, to wear old clothes, and do not let the liquids spatter, for they are strong enough to eat holes in almost anything, and even to char wood. The two-fluid cells are much stronger than the one-solution cells, and connected up in series they will develop considerable power.

For telegraph-sounders, large electric bells, and as accumulators for charging storage-batteries, the gravity-cell will give the most satisfactory results. The one shown in Fig. 8 consists of a deep glass jar, three strips of thin copper riveted together, and a zinc crow-foot that is caught on the upper edge of the glass jar. These parts will have to be purchased at a supply-house, together with a pound or two of sulphate of copper (bluestone).

To set up the cell, place the copper at the bottom and drop in enough of the crystals to generously cover the bottom, but do not try to imbed the metallic copper in the crystals; then fill the jar half full of clear water. In another jar dissolve two ounces of sulphate of zinc in enough water to complete the filling of the jar to within two inches of the top; then hang the zinc crow-foot on the edge of the jar so that it is immersed in the liquid and is suspended about three inches above the top of the copper strip. The wire that leads up from the copper should be insulated with a water-proof coating and well covered with paraffine. A number of these cells may be connected in series to increase the power of the current, and for a working-battery this will show a high efficiency. Note that at first the solutions will mingle. To separate them, join the[19] two wires and start the action; then, in a few hours, a dividing line will be seen between the white, or clear, and the blue solutions, and the action of the cell will be stronger. After long-continued use it may be necessary to draw off some of the clear zinc sulphate, or top solution, and replace it with pure water. The action of the acids reduces the metallic zinc to zinc sulphate and deposits metallic copper on the thin copper strips, and in this process an electrical current is generated.

A Plunge-battery
When two or more cells (in which sulphuric acid, bi-chromate of potash, or other strong electropoions are employed) are coupled in series, it would be well to arrange the copper and zinc, or the zinc and carbon, poles on a board, so that all of them may be lowered together into the solutions contained in the several jars. A simple arrangement of this kind is shown in Fig. 9, where a rack is built for the jars and at the top of the end boards a projecting piece of wood, supported by a bracket, is made fast. A narrow piece of board nearly the length of the jar-rack is fitted with the battery-poles, as shown at Fig. 9 A. The carbon and zinc, or copper and zinc, poles are attached to small blocks of wood (as described for Fig. 5), and this block in turn is fastened to the under side of the board with brass screws. The poles of the cells are to be connected (as explained in Fig. 6), and when the battery is in use the poles are immersed in the solution contained in the jars. When the battery is at rest the narrow board should be lifted up and placed on[20] the projecting arms of the rack, so that the liquid on the poles may drain into the jars directly underneath. One or more of these battery-racks may be constructed, but they cannot be made to hold conveniently more than four or six cells each; if more cells are required, those contained in each rack must be coupled up in series.

Batteries
A simpler plunge-battery is shown in Fig. 10. A cell-rack is made of wood and given two or three coats of shellac. The narrow board (to the under side of which the battery-poles are attached, as explained in Fig. 9) is hung on chains or flexible wires, which in turn are made fast to an iron shaft running the entire length of the cell-rack. This shaft is of half-inch round iron, and is held in place, at one end, by a pin and washer; while at the other the end is filed with a square shoulder, and a handle and crank is fitted to it, so that the shaft may be turned. A small hole, made at the side of the crank when it is hanging down, will receive a hard-wood peg, or a steel nail, and this will prevent the crank from slipping when the board holding the[21] poles is raised. If a gear-wheel and tongue can be had to fit on the shaft, it will then be possible to check the shaft securely at any part of a turn of the crank. The battery-poles are to be connected in series along the top of the portable board, as explained for Fig. 6. When two or more of these plunge-batteries are used at one time, the wire from the carbon of one is to be connected with the zinc pole of the next, and so on. The wire from the zinc of the first battery, and the wire from the carbon of the last battery, will be the ones available for use.

A Storage-battery
When more current is desired than the simple batteries will give, a storage-battery should be employed as an accumulator. This result can be secured by coupling primary cells in series, so that they will be constantly generating and feeding the battery. Storage-batteries are too heavy to be shifted about, like single cells or small plunge-batteries; they should be placed in a cellar, where the charging or primary cells can be located close by, and, unless positively necessary, the battery of cells and the accumulator should not be moved.

With sufficiently large insulated wires (Nos. 12, 14, or 16 copper), the current may be carried to any part of the house for use in various ways—such as running a light motor or a fan, lighting a lamp-circuit, or fusing metals and chemicals for experimental purposes. While the battery to be described is not a light one in weight, nor as economical as the improved new Edison storage-battery, it is a good and[22] constant one, and, if not overcharged or abused, will last for several years.

The component parts of a storage-battery are lead in metallic and chemical form, the electrolyte, or fluid, in which the plates are immersed, and the water-tight and chemical-proof cell or container. From a plumber, a supply-house, or a lead-works, obtain a quantity of three-eighth by one-quarter-inch strip-lead of the kind called chemical, or desilverized; also a larger quantity of lead-tape, one-sixty-fourth of an inch thick and three-eighths of an inch wide. This last is also known as torpedo-lead, and is kept by electrical supply-houses.

If the three-eighths by quarter-inch strip-lead cannot be had, then purchase eight or ten pounds of heavy sheet-lead, and, with a tin-shears, divide it into strips three-eighths of an inch wide and twenty-nine inches long, taking care to cut it of uniform width and with true edges. From hard-wood three-eighths or half an inch thick, cut a block six by seven inches and make four countersunk holes in it, so that it may be screwed fast to a table or bench, as shown in Fig. 11 A. Around this the lead strips should be shaped and beaten at the corners to make the angles sharp.

From the three-eighths by quarter-inch, or sheet-lead strips, make seven frames as shown in Fig. 12. This is done by binding a strip of the lead around the block, as shown at Fig. 11 B. Where the ends come together insert a short piece of lead, three-eighths or half-inch, as shown at Fig. 12 A, and solder it fast. A soldering-iron may be heated with a Bunsen-burner gas-flame or in a charcoal fire. However, if gas is available, it would be better to use the blue[23] flame from a Bunsen burner and direct the hot blast directly on the work with a blow-pipe, and so fuse the lead points together. After a little practice with the blow-pipe it will be used for many pieces of work in preference to the soldering-iron. If the sheet-lead is used for the frames in place of the three-eighths by quarter-inch strips, two or three strips will have to be taken, so as to build up the band of the frame to about a quarter of an inch in thickness. When soldered together, or fused at the edges, these built-up frames will be as rigid as the solid metal.
