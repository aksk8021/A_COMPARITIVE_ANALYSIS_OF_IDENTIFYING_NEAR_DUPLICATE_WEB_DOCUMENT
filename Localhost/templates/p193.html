My dear Cousine,

I read the pages with the deepest respect, and every printed word is for me the word of the Gospel. Born [p. 2]have we not known for a long time that MM. the editors would rather cut their fists than deceive public credulity? Besides, I heard in several cafes that journalism is a priesthood.

Now, for almost three months now, all the newspapers in Paris have celebrated in unison a small town in Germany called Baden. Some admire the wild beauty of its surroundings, the solitude of its forests, the majesty of the ruins that surround it, the healthiness of its waters, the mildness of its climate, the silence, the peace and the contemplation that one tastes there. . The others sound a resounding fanfare in honor of the balls, the spectacles, the symphonies, the hunts, the races, the fireworks and the brouhaha full of charms which fills this adorable hell.

A skeptic might be alarmed by these conflicting descriptions. For me, who has a simple heart and a conciliatory mind, I understood that everyone, according to their tastes, found silence or noise, crowds or solitude, in Baden-Baden, and that everyone was happy there. When I heard the simple manners, the hospitality and the disinterestedness of the natives praised, I remembered the ballads of the Middle Ages and the tales of the good Canon Schmidt; I was happy to learn that nothing had [p. 3]changed and that one still found beyond the Rhine Germany with a heart of gold, Germany with blue eyes. When I read in a correspondence from Baden: “The city is full of dukes, grand dukes, archdukes; we now only count them by the dozens. There are some in all the hotels; you meet them at the Conversation in companies of seven or eight; it is permitted to touch them with the hand and even to pat them respectfully on the stomach; I said to myself with a touch of democratic pride: "What does this prove?" That the century has passed, and that good Germany is at the head of progress. »

When I learned that a poor Italian arrived in Baden-Baden with twenty sous in his pocket and that he left there a millionaire, I smiled shrewdly, and I thought to myself: “Why be surprised? shouldn't we expect everything in a country ruled by the most magnificent of monarchs? This Bajazet or Bénazet whom the newspapers exalted at will, this prince who gave the most beautiful parties in Europe in salons worthy of Louis XIV, this friend of the arts who commissioned comedies and comic operas for the amusement of his court, this sportsman who throws fourteen thousand francs in litter to a horse which has run well, should he not [p. 4]do something for unfortunate Italy? »

That, my dear cousin, is the opinion that the newspapers gave me of Baden and its sovereign. I presume that all the French are of the same ideas, since they will draw the truth from the same sources as me.

You will understand the irresistible desire that pushed me one fine morning towards the small town and the great man of whom we speak so favorably every summer. I left like a ball. What did I say ? like a cashier. It is so much so that in my haste I forgot to go and see noon at the beautiful Strasbourg clock.

When the Kehl omnibus approached the right bank of the Rhine, my heart pounded, my eyes watered: "Hello!" I cried to myself, "Hello!" pensive Germany! stay of good faith and simplicity; homeland of naive virtues; sanctuary of innocent memories! Receive a foreigner whom chance brought to life in France, but who deserved to see the light of day among honest Germans! Perhaps I had thought a little high, because all the passengers on the omnibus began to look at me. My neighbor held out his hand to me and said:

“Monsieur, we are made for each other; touch there.

As he spoke the German language badly, I recognized [p. 5]that he was a German from the Grand Duchy of Baden. His face pleased me at first glance, and his costume too. His features seemed to have been sketched out with a knife by a local artist. His long, wide, flat feet were of those that lean heavily on the homeland and cover a wide expanse of native soil. Black woolen stockings, blue cloth breeches, a red waistcoat with copper buttons, a frock coat falling to the heels and an otter cap will complete your picture of this old German of the golden age. We soon became acquainted: give me a brave man, and within five minutes I will make him my friend.

He offered me a glass of beer so cordially that I took pleasure in missing the train to follow him home. It was a trading house, well supplied with goods of all kinds and from all countries: wines, liqueurs, crystals, cigars, bookshops, groceries, cutlery, there was everything in this store. Politeness commanded me to do some shopping there. I set my sights on some Bohemian crystals that I intended for your shelf; but the enormity of the duties to be paid restrained me.

"Never mind," exclaimed my new friend: [p. 6]we will let them in without permission from customs.

"Contraband?"

- Sure.

— Is it possible God! Honest German, you smuggle?

- Alas! sir, what would be the use of being a German if I didn't?

I remained confused. In my opinion, smuggling is theft. But I didn't want to tell this good man, for fear of upsetting him.

"So," I went on with an indifferent air, "you are wronging the French government for all the duties it would have to collect on your goods?"

"I flatter myself, and there isn't a German who doesn't reason like me." We like the French individually, but we don't like the government of France. Obliging individuals by defrauding the administration is a double pleasure.

There was something specious in this argument that dazzles me.

"I hope at least," I said to him, "that you refrain from harming your government?"

He looked at me like a man who doesn't understand. I developed my question.

[p. 7]

"Here," I said, "Champagne wine, brandy from Cognac, cigars from Havana, English razors, tea: I have no doubt that all these foreign foodstuffs have paid rights to Bajazet, I mean to the government of the Grand Duke.

The worthy German began to laugh, and with such good heart, that I shared his hilarity without knowing why.

- That ! he cried, pointing to the goods I had named; that ! it's German like my hat, and it never came from abroad.

- What ! this Champagne wine does not come from Champagne?

— Is there a Champagne?

"That Cognac brandy?"

"We do it ourselves, and I beg you to believe that it is neither more nor less."

"But your English razors?" your Havana cigars?

— English razors from Germany, Havanese cigars from Hamburg.

"And the tea, what the hell?"

“German tea, my dear sir. And long live the German fatherland!

I was seriously surprised, and I started to [p. 8]to say that probity varies according to climate. Because, finally, a Rouennais who would do this kind of trade would not pass for an honest merchant, and the courts would condemn him for deception on the nature of the goods. I regretted having brought the conversation to such a delicate text, and, to break the dogs, I began to look at a bookstore shelf. All our novelists figured in it by rank of stature, from M. Mérimée to M. Xavier de Montépin.

"For once," I exclaimed with a certain relief, "here's some French merchandise."

"French, if you will." It is possible that these books were written in French; but no one will dispute with us the honor of having printed them.

“Mercy! counterfeits!

- Oh! you do not yet know German patriotism.

I felt myself blushing to my ears. In my opinion, Cousin, counterfeiting is the most infamous of all thefts, for it only plunders the poor. My host took my silence for admiration; he showed me statues, groups, works of art of all kinds, molded in Germany to the detriment of French artists; French engravings and lithographs [p. 9]reproduced and spoiled by German patriotism. This spectacle did not positively diminish my enthusiasm, but it shook all my ideas. I realized that the notion of justice and injustice is very incomplete among Parisians, and that Germany has a much broader moral sense than we do.

- Wait ! said my host, you are not at the end of your astonishment. Here's a drawer you'll tell me about. It is full of entirely German curiosities, the likes of which are not produced in Paris.

Here, my poor cousin, allow me to veil my face. Neither your age, nor your sex, nor my modesty allow me to take inventory of this drawer. Be content to learn that it was full of images, moldings and playthings, curious no doubt, but of an indescribable nature. 'The German people,' I said to myself, 'must be very honest at heart, and of a well-tested candor, so that they can handle all these filthiness without danger. »

A neighboring drawer contained a few thousand tickets for all the royal and grand-ducal lotteries. Lotteries in Germany! You can see my new amazement from here. I didn't have time to say it out loud: a young German had just entered the store, and [p. 10]I admired her suave beauty. His hair was as blond and as silky as the best combed hemp. Simply dressed, a small traveling bag in her hand, she seemed to me more poetic than Dorothy in Goethe's masterpiece. She greeted us modestly and bought various things. Her shopping, which I would not have dared to do, surprised me so much that I asked her what country she was going to. She told me, without being disturbed, that she was going to Paris to live on a familiar basis with a man who was quite old, but young at heart. A friend of hers, who had been living in France for two years, had got her this good job. She had no fear of getting bored, for she would find several German women of her acquaintance in Paris, established in similar conditions.

"Here," I said to my host, "is a new kind of export."

- Hey! hey! he answered with his big cordial laugh; we sell what we have.

The young girl paid in gold; the merchant gave him his remainder in French money.

"Since you're going abroad," he said to her, "I don't want to give you counterfeit money!"

It was still up to me to prick up my ears. Counterfeit money… I couldn't believe it.

[p. 11]

The excellent man showed me in his counter a rack full of silvered and desilvered copper.

"All these coins," he told me, "are far from worth the sum they represent." But, as a large part of the national wealth is in money of this ilk, we use it among ourselves.

It had been less than an hour since I had trod the sacred soil of Germany, and I had had time to become acquainted with institutions very different from ours. The counterfeit money, the lottery, the smuggling, the counterfeiting, the falsification of foodstuffs, the export of blondes and so many other unexpected things showed me this beautiful country in a new light. My good opinion of the Germans remained intact, because one does not forget in one day thirty years of sympathy and admiration. However, I felt at the bottom of my heart a vague uneasiness; I longed to get to that town of Baden whose reputation is so pure in the newspapers. I took leave of my host, who did not seem to bid me farewell without regret:

"So," he said, "you leave without having chosen anything from my shop." I'm upset, not for me, but for you.

- To me ! Ah! I shall not leave here until you have explained that word to me.

[p. 12]

- Nothing's easier. The money you spend with us would be as much saved, and what you take back to Baden as much is lost.

This word deserves an explanation. I desperately wanted to get to the bottom of it, and I missed the train for the second time.

But why didn't I believe the honest merchant of Kehl? why did I accuse him of calumniating the institutions of his country and the great men of Germany? I would have done better to empty my purse in his store! I would have brought back to Paris rather mediocre foodstuffs, but at least I would have brought back something.

I left for Baden despite the omens. The first object I saw at the station was a Swiss in livery, cane in hand. Emblematic character, who alone symbolizes the majestic slowness of the German railways. As the distance between Kehl and Baden-Baden is very short, we were made to change trains three times to lengthen it a little. We walked slowly through mediocre landscapes. A few little villagers, barefoot, had fun running along the road and passing us from time to time. We finally arrive.At first, when my poor money was ringing [p. 13]still in my pockets, the surroundings of the city seemed beautiful to me. Yes really, almost as beautiful as the Vosges, which the French know so little about. There are wooded hills, fairly green lawns, and a small river where it would be easy to pour water. The town itself, as far as I could tell, consists of fairly clean inns, with a few small gardens around it. As I had come without any luggage, I walked very slowly, hands in my pockets, following the world. It seemed to me that everyone was going the same way. I passed in front of a vast building laden with large bad paintings, and I feared for a moment that it was the palace of the sovereign. But the crowd did not stop there, and no one entered. Was it the ugliness of the paintings that frightened the public? I couldn't find out. An obliging walker told me that this building contained a spring of mineral water. We don't know yet whether it's good or bad, since no one has had the curiosity to taste it.

I passed on, and I arrived in front of a large hall, decked out with flags. The colors of the country are yellow and red. This set is not harmonious, but it is cheerful, it makes you think of a puppet. A few workers hung colored glasses on the front of the [p. 14]landmark; others were preparing everything for a fireworks display. A poster pasted on the wall announced a grand ball and a show for the evening, and horse races for the following day. By these munificences I recognized that I was indeed in M. Bénazet's capital.

The square was covered with quite a crowd of people. I discovered there in a short time twenty faces of my acquaintance. Arsène Houssaye, Decourcelle, Méry, Maxime Ducamp, Amédée Achard, Delacour, Edmond Martin, Charles Marchal, Carjat, Paul d'Ivoi, Clément Caraguel, Vivier, Régnier, Bressant, Sainte-Foy, poets, philosophers, journalists, artists strolled there, as on the Boulevard des Italiens. Count Sollohub was rhyming in good French at the foot of a German tree, and Mademoiselle Fix, in a little corner, was enraging three-quarters of the Jockey Club. “Obviously, I said to myself, the man who knew how to gather around his palace so many intelligent beings is no ordinary prince, and, since Pericles…”

A friend walked around the square with me, naming the great characters. There were some from all over Europe; less than I would have thought. I saw five or six really pretty women, who nobody paid attention to. On the other hand, we hurried around [p. 15]two or three foreign weeds, crumpled, wrinkled, scorched, faded as if they had traveled in trunks until the age of fifty. This is what I saw at first glance.

On second inspection, I noticed that all the faces were if not sad, at least sullen. I did not expect to find the public so serious in the middle of an ocean of pleasures. Two members of the Jockey Club passed on my right arm in arm. One said: "She took a thousand louis from me in two days." 'I've had more luck,' replied the other. 'I only leave him five hundred. "What consoles me a little," resumed the first, "is that that big boy from Agen avenged us." »

She ? who she ? This feminine intrigued me a little. Surely the person we were talking about was not Mademoiselle Fix. But I should have liked to know the name of the woman who dipped so cheerfully into the pockets of the Jockey-Club.

I fell into the middle of a group of columnists and vaudevillians. They were talking about the same person, but without naming him. One complained of having given him six hundred francs; another had left him the price of eighteen articles; a third had been stripped by her of all his season copyrights. She, [p. 16]always her! I didn't dare ask the name of such a dangerous creature: people would have laughed at my ignorance, because these gentlemen like to banter their neighbors.

Hunger seized me, it was six o'clock; I entered a restaurant called Restoration. I asked to be served German style; the waiters probably understood that I wanted to be served slowly. I waited for a chair for twenty minutes, and the other dishes came in the same train. Can you imagine if I had time to listen to the conversation at the neighboring tables! There was one fully furnished with pretty girls or who had been pretty. I recognized almost all of them from having seen them in the Bois de Boulogne in two-horse carriages. In Baden, their fortune seemed more modest; they barely had a few jewels left. They huddled together sadly, like doves caught in a storm, and they drank champagne, swearing softly between their teeth. Surely, I thought, it is not one of these ladies who has robbed the Jockey-Club. I soon saw that I had been right, for they were also grumbling at the dangerous creature who had stripped them of everything. Damn! I had always heard that wolves do not eat each other.

[p. 17]

One of these ladies exclaimed in the heat of her spite:

"To think that the beggar stole fifty thousand francs from me!"

- Bah ! replied her neighbor philosophically; you will do it again this winter.

- Yes, but what work!

Poor lady! I pitied her with all my heart. She was older and visibly tired. By what efforts could she earn fifty thousand francs in one winter, in our country where the work of women is so badly remunerated?

I dined, however, and had one of the worst meals I can remember. Ah! it was not that table of M. Bénazet which is mentioned in the newspapers. So I longed to make the acquaintance of this great man, so that he would invite me to dinner. At least it was he who treated me to dessert. His fireworks that I saw for nothing, and without leaving the table, pleased me infinitely. I called a journalist from Paris who was entering the room, and I described to him in warm terms my admiration and my gratitude.

'You're right,' he said to me, 'he's the most amiable, the best and the most generous of men. Granier de Cassagnac once said; "Damn Root!" » If he [p. 18]came to Baden for a day, he would exclaim with just as much reason: "Shit Louis XIV!" »

I got up from the table and walked in front of the great hall, under the illuminated portico. I have a philosophical digestion, as you know, especially after a bad meal. I thought to myself that the Manichaeans are not entirely wrong when they claim that the world is divided between two contrary influences. For here, on the one hand, is an evil creature who sets about putting people out of business; and here, on the other hand, is a benefactor of men who distinguishes himself every day by a new liberality. But who could this fatal person be? A passer-by told me by knocking me over.

"Gradine!" he cried; she shaved me like a pontoon: I don't have thirty francs left to go back to the shop!

- Who ? I said to him, taking him by the collar, who robbed you of your money?

The traveling salesman answered with excusable brusqueness:

"But how stupid is he?" it is the Bank.

At the same time, he pointed out to me, through the open door, a large table surrounded by people.

I went to see what was happening there, and I understood a little [p. 19]of moments that the Bank is a being of reason, a pure abstraction, but an abstraction which takes money from the poor world. The honest merchant of Kehl had mentioned it to me in veiled terms, but I had forgotten what he had told me. I innocently watched the battle of the Bank and the players. My neighbor, who was playing, was lucky enough to amass a tidy sum in a few moments. This example attracted me. I saw that with a little luck it would be easy for me to have the Bank pay all the expenses of my trip. What a pleasure to tell Paris that I saw M. Bénazet face to face, and that it cost me nothing! I therefore began to play a very small game; but the devil was probably in the game, because I lost every time. Or rather no: I once won ten francs which were picked up by a gentleman,

I still hoped that fortune would return to me, and that my neighbors would allow me to profit from it, but my purse ran out sooner than my bad luck, and I found myself penniless. The move of my finances was done in less than half an hour. All my money had gone to swell a huge pile of coins in which I no longer even recognized my louis.

[p. 20]

I remained for a moment quite sheepish, not really knowing where I would sleep. A timid little German slipped in front of me and threw down five francs, which were immediately lost. But at the same time a policeman tapped him on the shoulder and led him to a corner. I followed them and heard the agent say:

- This is the second time I take you there. To begin with, you were fined; today, your business is clear; you will go to jail.

Nothing was more unjust than these threats; for after all the poor devil had played and lost fairly. I resolved to come to his defense and to prove to myself that one could, without a valiant penny, oblige one's neighbour. But, at the first word of my plea, the agent answered brutally:

'Mister stranger, this is none of your business. This man is an inhabitant of Baden; the townspeople aren't allowed to play, and I'm paid to stop them.

- Parbleu! I replied, you should have done me the same service. You must have little esteem for the Bank, since you forbid it to ruin your fellow citizens. So you're sure she has to win every time? That's why you give him the [p. 21]naive foreigners, like me, while protecting your nationals from it. I'll write it to my cousin, and it will change her ideas about German loyalty.

What distressed me the most, my dear Madeleine, was not having lost my money; it was to leave Baden without having seen that good M. Bénazet. For after all I had not a moment to lose; I had to take advantage of my return ticket and take flight at once. Cursed Bank! Bank scoundrel! it deprived me of the pleasure of knowing the Louis XIV of our century, the most magnificent of the benefactors of humanity!

If Providence did things well, it would place M. Bénazet at one end of Europe and the Bank at the other end. And I would never get lost in the country of the Bank, but I would go every year to admire the beautiful parties of M. Bénazet.

[p. 22]

II
AN OUTDOOR CLUB
Danger of picking horse chestnuts in the Tuileries garden. — A very mixed meeting. - The Rainbow. - The rosary. — The choristers in unison. — A young businesswoman. — The blue blouse and the gold glasses. — The man with the bread dumplings. — The valet of a foreign lord. “An unreasonable old lady. — The policy of Tortillard. — My statement. — I receive a fraternal welcome, like all newcomers to journalism. — Philosophical reflections.

My dear Cousine,

You may live far from Paris and read blue tales more often than the newspapers: it is impossible that you did not hear the noise that was made here last week. Freedom of the press was on the table. One newspaper took the liberty of saying it didn't feel free enough, and a few others joined in. The government replied that they were wrong, that their hands were not tied, and that they must have lost [p. 23]mind to shake imaginary irons so loudly.

The day this news was published in Paris, the weather was fine, by great chance. I walked, as usual, without thinking of anything; my feet carried me into a large garden which extends along the banks of the Seine, between the Tuileries Palace and the Place de la Concorde. The horse chestnuts begin to fall; I picked up some. This innocent recreation threw me into the middle of a group of nine or ten people. There were two ladies among the number; however, everyone spoke at the same time, according to the custom of newspapers or journalists.

A man who seemed to exercise some authority shouted from time to time: “Silence! A big, fat, pock-marked bittern kept making the noise again and shaking his fists at everyone. The first had to be an official character. His bald and serious forehead contrasted singularly with his youthful face. The buttonhole of his frock coat shone with all the colors of the rainbow. The other had the bearing of a pedant and the manners of a porter: I would have taken him for a nobody, if I had not seen a rosary hanging out of his pocket.

Finally the tumult subsided. The young man with the rainbow [p. 24]declared the meeting open; each took a chair, and I sat down like everyone else, out of a spirit of curiosity.

— Gentlemen, said the rainbow, we are missing two of our colleagues, and precisely, if I am not mistaken, two speakers from the opposition. We will begin however, because the opposition is a fact and not a principle, and we must deal with it as if it did not exist.

The man with the beads cried like a crow. The rainbow politely called him to order; it was not without shrugging the shoulders. He even leaned towards his neighbor and whispered in his ear:

“You wouldn't find a man so badly brought up in the whole country; you wouldn't find two of them in the Universe.

He resumed aloud:

'I called you together to hear your complaints against this morning's little note. For my part, I am very satisfied with it. Freedom of the press does not smile on me. I had, under all regimes, the privilege of saying everything with impunity, but I never took advantage of it. The slightest word takes on too much importance when passing through my mouth. I blow up or down, trust or terror, peace or war. That is why [p. 25]I hold my wind, for everyone's sake. You could almost call me the Whist , organ of silence. Now, gentlemen, I ask you, if my neighbors had the right to say everything I have a duty to keep silent, would I still have a subscriber?

The speaker buttoned up to the chin. He then turned with protective familiarity to four or five gentlemen whose blue coats with metal buttons looked like uniforms or liveries.

'Gentlemen,' he said to them, 'develop in your view the things which I have summarily expressed. It is understood that, if you are wrong in a single word, I am here to contradict you.

The men in uniform all began to pronounce one and the same speech at the same time. They spoke in unison, like the voices that make up the same part in a choir:

— I applaud, they said, at the remarkable words of my official colleague: why would God have given me two hands, if not to applaud? Freedom of the press is too great, in my opinion, since newspapers are allowed to exist which never applaud anything. For my part, I am perfectly free to print anything a minister dictates to me, except to receive [p. 26]from another minister a warning or denial. This condition pleases me, although a bit dependent. Because after all, if I put on the uniform here, it's not to act at my head, it's to earn a lot of money with little danger.

The rainbow smiled as a sign of alliance and protection. He then said, with a darker brow:

— The floor is with our bitter enemies. You, madam, please speak first. You are from the opposition; at least, you have been there under all regimes.

The person arrested was a young woman of twenty-three, but very mature and very serious for her age. Widow of a journalist of genius, she married a second time to a great financier, and it is assured that she renders him services. Be that as it may, his new lord entrusts him with the most valuable interests, for I saw in his lap a huge roll of stock of every kind. She caressed them with her hand as she spoke. His voice was short and jerky; his sentence fell into paragraphs, as metal thrown from a height falls into shot.
