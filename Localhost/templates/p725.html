In times of peace, shall I think otherwise? what does it matter! On this subject, I believe that we all dream in a similar way: our memories of war will grow, the sonorous voice of the cannon will stifle the complaints, the glorious ensemble will no longer make it possible to distinguish the dismal detail. "Memories of war... they still have to be memories of war!" Ah! I would like my poor Stork, given what is happening to him, to forget a little the ugliness of the grief from which he suffers, from which he suffers, alas! without phrases and reasonably. — Moreover, this story once again gives me the certainty that only adventures happen to each being, however hard he tries; this one that I am going to tell you, seems imagined by Cigogne himself so that he suffers more. One would swear that this man does not know himself. Think again: he knows how to place his wound! Chance struck Cigogne. Chance? Stork couldn't have found better. I pity Cigogne with all my heart. - Listen.

My injury is more serious than we first thought, and here I am, perhaps for a long time, in the hospital. I would prefer something else; I'm bored. I spend the day listening to conversations, playing dominoes; I try to take an interest in the anecdotes that the nurses tell me (I seem to know them already, these anecdotes; they are not very original!) In my spare time, I take a few sketches, but I believe they are worthless; I am feverish and drawing soon becomes a fatigue. From Cigogne, no news, except for an uninteresting postcard, in which he announces his day off to Dannemarie. Does not matter to me. Will stork forget me?

Yesterday morning, unpleasant surprise: I see the young Raymond Chert enter, you know! that apache-looking brigadier, with dirty fingernails, oiled hair, and who made such a charming marriage of love. Cigogne was full of indulgence for him. He seems to be looking for someone; he looks right and left.

“Oh! there you are, Serval! »

What does he want from me?

“Hello Serval.

- Hello.

— Haven't had time to congratulate you again on your citation; I come to shake your hands.

"Is that why you're here, Sergeant?"

- For that too.

- And then ?

- And then, of course, to give you news of the comrades. Yesterday the captain sent me here on a mission… you see, margis, I have the confidence! I'm going back tonight, so Lieutenant Bernaut like that he said to me: "Go to the hospital and give this note to Serval..."

— Give.

— As for the comrades, they are fine, almost all of them. Yes, no new hassles, except…”

He has an unpleasant little smile at the corner of his mouth. He interrupts himself to tell me small talk. 'I don't know why, Raymond Chert disgusts me more than ever today.

“Father Dietrich coughs his stomach… And how is your leg?

— Give the lieutenant the note. »

He searches his pockets for a long time.

“It is also said that Moreau, the new telephone operator, will become a brigadier…

— Give the lieutenant the note. »

- Oh! good God ! where did I put it, this note!… And we found rotgut in the cellar of…

— Give the lieutenant the note.

- Here is ! here is ! be patient! »

He doesn't get angry. Raymond Chert never gets angry. Raymond Chert is always polite, sometimes too polite, with the people he is afraid of. He finds the note, finally. I open it. "A few affectionate and kind words from Lieutenant Bernaut, but what does this postscript mean?"

“Brigadier Chert who will bring you this envelope will tell you of the deplorable accident of which your friend Maxence was the victim. If you see Maxence, watch him: his morale seems bad. »

I immediately ask:

“What happened to Maxence?

"To Stork?" »

Raymond Chert is happy; he assumes an air of perfect innocence, his eyes smile, his lips quiver with pleasure.

“Yes, to Cigogne… Come on, tell me!

- I thought you knew me! Ah! the poor guy, he is very annoyed! it must also be said that it's bad luck, but he takes it badly, ah! yes, he takes it badly! Glad we didn't tell you. It happened like this: three days after you left for the hospital, Cigogne had his day off. So he went to Dannemarie to take it easy, he said. And then, he meets two comrades and they unearth a corner where they went to drink. They were drinking your health, margis, because of the quote, you know. So they were happy… not drunk, you know: happy. And Cigogne, then, he goes to the square; he wasn't walking very straight, but we didn't know that, and, you know, I wouldn't have said that, would I? and besides, I hadn't seen it. So he was singing like that… He was happy for your quote, I guess. And now he slips and goes to fuck himself under a fodder that turned the corner of the town hall, and he gets his foot pinched. Ah! nice work, we can say! Crushed, his paw! in marmalade! They take him to the ambulance; perhaps he will be brought here later and you will see him; it could be, but it's not sure. Ah! how he bawled, poor thing! not for the pain, because first he fainted, like a girl, but afterwards, because he was saying, like that, that it wasn't good, that it was his fault. The idiot! why his fault? He had slipped on the wet pavement, that's all! and a loaded fodder is heavy, isn't it? Besides, the other two held their tongues. It sobered them up, as it were, and we knew nothing, but Cigogne is not happy: a crushed foot, isn't it? And all because he was happy, too happy for a quote from a friend… Huh? there are people who...

"Have you finished, Sergeant?" I asked.

- But I think. »

Raymond Chert is a little worried.

“So go away.

- Yes, it's time ... Goodbye, margis ... How! you don't want to shake my hand? »

I had taken mine off too obviously for the scumbag to take no notice.

"No, and if I could get up, I'd walk you out with my foot." »

He grimaces; he tries to find something to say, a venomous answer; he fails, and, as no one has heard, as we were talking low, he writes off the incident as profit and loss. He shrugs. He decamps.

But, three minutes later, he returns.

“Oh! this is funny! I announce a visit, margis. Cigogne is there, in the yard, at the moment. Yes, yes, I'm off! Bye. »

And, indeed, a few moments later, Cigogne appears, supported on the left by a robust orderly, on the right on a crutch. "He's thin, he's pale, he hurts." At my request, they lay him close to me. He didn't say a word at first, then, with a wicked smile and showing the crutch:

“Eh, Serval? he murmurs, the crutch of the badly wounded! Coquette, my glory, right? well adjusted to my heroism! Lucienne may be delighted, delighted, I mean, to see me again! »

CHAPTER XXXVIII
I went home. I find myself alone in my studio. The weather is nice. I lean on the small balcony from which, so many times, I have contemplated the numerous and diverse aspects of Paris, changing with the hour and the play of the sun. All this expanse, this population of roofs, this luminous air, easy to breathe, all this to lose my gaze in it, and this greenery of a few nearby trees to rest it...The white spot of the Sacré-Coeur is a little misty this morning, but I recognize the tone of this slow passing water, I recognize the colors of my dear river. - I liked being so high up! I loved this landscape! For many years, my cumbersome neighbour, the Eiffel Tower, no longer bothered me; I admitted his presence.

You can observe the city at your leisure from this seventh floor, with its shadows, its distant mists, its soon-to-be-familiar details, its delicate and precise design, the bustle of the lowly people who inhabit it, the dreams that will deliver tomorrow. - But today, why do I have no pleasure in leaning on the balcony of my studio?

My foot hurts, my leg hurts, my thigh hurts a bit… No, that's not enough. There is something else. There is that I am not here, that I feel far from here… Hey! what ? should I be sleeping near Doris, near Tierspoint?... It's true; I only think of those who are sleeping, protected by a few damp planks; I think of those I have known, with whom I have spoken, whom I have seen living and who are underground, of those who have passed close to me, of others, of so many others of whom I don't even know the name, and who are underground too, or close to being there. I no longer understand this living city, stretched out at my feet, but there is another city, huge, all black, full of narrow, badly kept cells... In this city, I walk, every evening.

My leg gives me a lot of pain… From time to time, an officer, a comrade on leave, comes to congratulate me on having a leg in poor condition. We chat in a friendly way, but always, when he is gone, this embarrassment comes back to find me alone at home. When one is hurt, even as I am (modestly, in short), one must, on opening the door of one's home, find there parents or a wife and children who welcome you with exclamations, who admire that you get hurt and call you a hero. I did not experience this.

Of course, when I went to see her at Versailles where she lives, my dear mum was delightful and my little sister very moved, but mum remains terribly absorbed in her good works and my little sister seems very concerned about the fate of a young ensign whom I like very much, whom mother likes very much, who pleases everyone very much.

Yes that's it ! Mom escapes me, my little sister escapes me. Mom never wanted, will never want to live in Paris and my little sister will soon get married (perhaps during the war). She still lovingly files her brother's sketches, but… ah! if her young ensign made sketches, how much better would she class them!

Mama, my little sister, what strange things you said to me about my life at the front! Mom, it's not my fault that I'm not good friends with all the chaplains in the sector; I know one that is perfect, but that's not enough for you! And you, little sister, you seem to be interested only in the naval army! “Yes, those I cherish escape me; I escape those I cherish. — I came back from Versailles with a heavy heart.

In Paris, the studio where I live, where I enjoyed myself, where I had memories, is still not a home; it is a dwelling. The two things do not merge, alas!

And yet, my old maid (her name is Josephine) had arranged everything to receive me. What more can I ask for? She removed the dust, she beat the carpet and the curtains, she made the covers disappear, she even hung up all the canvases (I had turned them against the wall, in a dark corner), she knew how to put them back to their old places: "the tall naked lady" above the fireplace, "Monsieur's friend" to the right of the door, "the young lady in green" against the light... Climbing a ladder, what dangerous gymnastics didn't she give herself up, so that Monsieur would feel at home when he arrived!

Ah! my good Josephine, neither this cleanliness, nor this meticulous order, nor this pot of fresh orangeade prepared with your old hands will change much: my home is far from here. — How I would like to hear the whinnying of a horse, the rolling of a van on the road, the sharp whistles of a few bullets, that big thundering voice, over there, then the clear voices of the comrades, a frank laugh, even a cry of pain , and the big voice still coming closer! How I would like to see a very simple horizon in front of me with two villages, one opposite, the other further to the left, which should be observed carefully… My telephone is there, very close… Come on! I derail! this return to Paris is worth nothing to me.

I'm afraid my leg will be an unwanted leg for a long time. So…the office?…blacking out paper in an office?…ugh! — If I add that I don't have the slightest desire to paint, here I am in a good position to take life joyfully.

Yesterday I met three war wounded who only had one leg between them; they walked with pestles, without crutches; each leaned on his two canes. They were walking (they were walking!) with one leg between them. My own leg is barely broken, a little twisted, a little damaged, just bad enough to hamper a gait that once was easy… Those I saw on my way back to Paris yesterday were walking with only one leg; now they were three men, having the right to two legs each; that's six. They had one. I have two legs, one of which is in poor condition.

The landscape of this city bores me; I return to my studio, hobbling. Here he is, I recognize him; the day is very good there. Take ! my latest sketch! I did it before leaving, on August 3rd. I do not understand anything. This mess of colors, is it therefore I who committed it, in anticipation of a future painting? Ah! really... Well, sign it Martin or Durand, and this sketch will be completely indifferent to me; it is already completely foreign to me.

Up there, under the ceiling, I recognize my old canvases hung by Josephine's careful hands; landscapes, portraits, still lifes, these various essays remind me of ways of seeing and feeling that I no longer have, but that I still love. I believe that they have remained alive, in spite of the obvious faults which one finds there and which often bear witness to an excessive haste, even to some pretension. I was young ; I forgive myself these faults and it worries me a little to admit to myself that I can no longer paint like this. — At the moment these paintings are like a frieze of shimmering memories, at the top of the wall of your bistre and I allow myself to be seduced by the pleasure of looking at them; I return to circumstances, impressions, emotions of the same period: an hour of enthusiasm, a disappointing hour when everything went wrong,

Let some time pass; I may paint again one day, but for today, I hardly think about it, and besides, my leg is really too painful when I stand up. The medical officer, while reforming me, advised a long stay in the country and rest; I was therefore right to accept the unexpected invitation that Mahoudiaux extended to me last Sunday in such a simple and affectionate way.

The excellent man! I saw him for the first time, in the hospital, leaning over Cigogne's bed and pouring out, in a sympathetic and sonorous voice which he barely stifled, a whole flood of good words. I was waking up from a nap when I saw this kind of giant. It could only be Mahoudiaux, because Cigogne had described him to me many times. Now I compared the image evoked and the live model at leisure, feeling free and clear after this short nap. I listened to the adjoining talk: Cigogne didn't say much, but Mahoudiaux spoke for two, he talked all the time.

Singular pleasure to hear a new appreciation of questions which had interested me in the past, and believing myself to be a doctor, to see another doctor examine my patient and pull the strings which I had tried to act on this mind. . Mahoudiaux had come to the hospital in all haste, to give Cigogne some courage, to destroy certain thoughts in him, to give birth to others and, my faith, he did it very well.No, Mahoudiaux was not the good fat brute that one loves out of habit, the good, inconsequential boy that one knew in college, the blond colossus full of primitive and rough-hewn qualities, the affectionate, faithful being but brief, which Cigogne had presented to me one day when he was almost jealous of it! No, from the start, he seemed to me to be very knowledgeable, very shrewd, and under his rough envelope, of a charming delicacy. Half an hour had not yet passed when I sensed something touching, a signal kindness in the heavy voice of a Norman nurse.

"So... you're sure... Stork was saying in an uncertain tone, you're sure I can...

'I'm sure,' interrupted Mahoudiaux, 'that you're lost if you let yourself sink now. You weren't made for this war: that's no doubt why it struck you so brutally. Yes, it's very hard, I agree, but where does this rage come from to scratch your wound to suffer even more?

'Come on, old man,' said Cigogne with a smile of underlined bitterness, 'my foot is far too wrapped in bandages; I don't scratch anything at all.

- Shut your mouth ! resumed Mahoudiaux, I should whip you like a child! You hear me perfectly. With this system, my little Roger, you will only manage to exasperate yourself, to exasperate those around you, to rob them of the courage you have already lost. You were unlucky, but is a player in bad luck logically forced to take the plunge? — In your memories, you only choose the most horrible ones to make them even more ugly; the others, your beautiful memories, you fiddle with them, you spoil them, you damage them, until the day when they cause you pain. So you're happy and you go back to your dark memories! The result is simple: for a very painful accident which could indeed sadden you for a while, you lose your mind, you will make those who love you lose it! Roger, you are an insufferable kid! I no longer recognize the friend of twenty years that you were for me, and what will Lucienne say, seeing you so broken? Just imagine that in an hour (an hour, my little Roger!) her train will be at the station and that, shortly after, you will see her come in here! Think about that! You have to become your master again, you have to become yourself again and since this dream of glory that you had had (all wrong by the way) has been refused to you, escapes you, you have to make another one for yourself. another, a dream in your size, this time a dream that you can live with your wife, at home. "And that's really all I have to say to you." » that you become yourself again and since this dream of glory that you had (all wrong by the way) is refused to you, escapes you, you have to redo another one, a dream to your size, this time a dream that you can live with your wife, at home. "And that's really all I have to say to you." » that you become yourself again and since this dream of glory that you had (all wrong by the way) is refused to you, escapes you, you have to redo another one, a dream to your size, this time a dream that you can live with your wife, at home. "And that's really all I have to say to you." »

But, nevertheless, he continued to speak and I could see that he knew Cigogne well. A few moments later, he looked at his watch and checked the time of Madame Maxence 's train. He wanted to take her to the hospital himself. So I thought it best to wake up officially; we were called to each other and a few pleasant phrases followed. Finally Mahoudiaux left and I remained alone next to Cigogne who seemed a little agitated.

“Serval… you know: my wife is coming.

- Oh! really… "

I said how pleased I would be to be introduced to him and hastened to speak of Mahoudiaux.

"A good fellow," Stork said; I have often described it to you. He's a bit short-sighted, but he's a good guy, and he likes me a lot… Serval! Lucienne is coming; I am upset. In front of her, I must not let myself be defeated: I must hold on.

"Yes, that's obvious," I replied. Speaking of which, I'm glad this room is clean and doesn't feel too gloomy. Here, look: at the moment she is quite gay… Women are so easily influenced by these things! »

Then I told her about the new nurse and told her various gossip. We talked thus for some time. Although he had been fever-free for three days, Cigogne still seemed very nervous. When he wanted to talk to me about his wife, I quickly changed the conversation, but I too was very anxious to really see Madame Maxence with my own eyes. She finally entered, followed by Mahoudiaux, who did not stay long.

Mrs. Maxence… what can I say? Since then, I have seen her almost every day and my opinion has not changed much. 'She's a small, fairly slender, very pretty person, whose face inspires confidence with her clean features. Dark brown hair, styled in a quiet way, a beige dress, also quiet; a determined pace, without affectation of importance; lovely, delicious hands that she took off: fine, intelligent hands, without rings...

Lucienne Maxence has kindness in her eyes and cheerfulness, but her mouth is precise. His eyes know how to laugh, smile, be tender; his mouth, with less diverse expression, stands in benevolent calm. Never irony, never this severe pinching which hardens the lips; no, just security. The gray eyes are younger than the mouth; there remains something childish about it which pleases me; I believe they would gladly dream.

From the start, Cigogne's wife had all my sympathy, but, thinking of what my comrade had said to me about her, I thought:“How badly you explain yourself, dear Madame! How poorly you explain yourself, Florimonde! »

I soon saw that this spontaneous sympathy which she inspired in me had not been returned to me. First she looked at me gravely:

“Oh! yes… Mr. Serval…”

A furtive flash passed in her eyes, then she added:

“Perfectly. »

This “perfectly” was a little dry… and we began to talk.

While spouting a thousand platitudes, I took pains to prevent her in my favour. In front of Cigogne, I spoke of Cigogne with affection: to him, I affirmed that his anxieties would be alleviated by the presence of his wife, to her, I told pleasant anecdotes about her husband, to Mahoudiaux, I repeat how many times Roger m boasted of his old and solid friendship. Then I added:

“He especially needs a moral rest which he will find neither in infirmaries nor in hospitals; he has suffered too much, in any case, and particularly from the worst; he was not made for that suffering, Madame, and his courage is all the greater for it since he bears it. »

She smiled with a surprised expression. Mahoudiaux also smiled, and I thought I saw sarcastic intentions on his well-informed mouth. It seemed to me that Lucienne Maxence was saying to herself: "Hey, hey, he speaks better than he writes, that imbecile!" » and Mahoudiaux: « Well, well, he noticed his blunder; he's trying to get out of it! »

Insensibly, the young woman's lips lost their severe aspect. Finally, I say again to Cigogne:

"And you're going to get a taste for life again, aren't you, Roger?"

He gave me a sinister look.

“You pronounce my name like one swallows a hot potato! Call me Stork, if Roger bothers you!

"But," interrupted Madame Maxence , "why Cigogne?" I still do not understand ! »

She looked right at me...

“Come on, my dear! said Mahoudiaux, let's not explain the nicknames: they always have their reason for being and are sometimes funny.

"I can't find it," said Madame Maxence .

- Neither do I ! whispered Stork.
