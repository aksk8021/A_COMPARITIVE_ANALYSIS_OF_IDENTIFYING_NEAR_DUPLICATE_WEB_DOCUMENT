What you are about to read is a history of the Café d'Orsay.

Last night at five o'clock the gabion was stuffed. The gabion, so that no one is unaware of it, is a room on the ground floor where we drink absinthe among ourselves. We were about twenty officers; the artillery dominated, the general staff was represented by the great Captain Brunner; there was a good deal of cavalry and a little of what we call (still among ourselves) "beneficial genius." »

Gougeon, of the Guides, was recounting the last concert at the Tuileries and was imperceptibly raising his head for Mademoiselle Nillson, when Brunner cut her off at the level of her mustache with a tremendous burst of laughter. Everybody opened their eyes, and Gougeon, who is not well-to-do, turned as pale as a handkerchief.

“Excuse me, Brunner! he said, half rising; I didn't know how to be so funny! »

Brunner, challenged, made the naive gesture of a sleeper being awakened. The guide resumed his sentence, raising his voice, but he did not finish it. He had met Brunner's gaze and seized, so to speak on the fly, one of those deep and heartbreaking emotions which cause our anger to fall at our feet.

"Dear friend," said the captain, "it is for me to ask your pardon." While listening to you, I wandered my eyes over the gazette, and I found there a news story,… one of those stories that you have to hasten to laugh at to avoid… you know what. »

He hadn't avoided anything at all, poor boy. His voice weakened, his eyes grew dim: he passed me the newspaper, pointing to the paragraph he couldn't read to us; but none of us found the word to laugh, or to cry, in this advertisement written in pomade style, like all the advertisements of high life .

“An illustrious and double marriage will bring together tomorrow before the aristocratic altar of *** the most brilliant and distinguished competition, the choice of choice. Madame la Comtesse de Gardelux marries the Vicomte de Chavigny-Senlis for a second time, and on the same day, at the same time, Mlle Auguste-Hélène de Gardelux is to give her hand to the young and rich Marquis de Forcepont. It is not surprising that birth is allied to birth, fortune to fortune, beauty and virtue to bravery and elegance; the marvelous, or, to speak correctly, the miraculous of this ceremony, is the almost twin beauty of the two noble brides: a layman introduced into the nave will believe he sees the marriage of two sisters. »

I had left the newspaper, and I drank a glass of water to pass the taste of this prose. Brunner bit his mustache and followed the veins of the marble, trying to fight back his tears. The assistants looked at each other without saying anything, too discreet to ask for a comment, but unable to grasp any connection between Brunner's emotion and a wedding in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.

Certainly he would not be out of place in the world, but we do not remember ever having met him there. He bears little or no resemblance to that amiable and brilliant George de Saint who was still leading a cotillion the morning of his departure for Mexico. He's a boy too serious for his age, a bit of a wolf, especially for two years. He was born in Alsace, in Obernai, I believe, from a family of winegrowers. His parents are more than comfortable, he would cut a figure in Paris, if he wanted to; but he cares little for appearances, the esteem of his comrades is enough for him. Of his person, he is good; maybe a little too tall and the shoulders too square. This robust body is surmounted by a regular face, white and pink: the blond mustache and blue eyes of pure Alsatians. His voice is excellent for command; in a living room, she would seem strong.

That secret might have died with him, if Fitz Moore, of the Voltigeurs, had not entered in the middle of my reading. He let me finish and said: “My goodness, not all French names are pronounced as they are written… We write Gardelux, but we say Gardlu.

- Take ! exclaimed Blavet, from the 25th , I should have remembered. In my promotion, there was a Gardelux. For example, to tell you what has become of it, I'm not knowledgeable enough about the Directory.

"I know it myself," said Brunner. Two years ago he died in Africa, in my arms. The two women who are getting married tomorrow are his mother and his sister. And I would give my head to cut off that, on such a day, the two coquettes will not have a poor little memory for him! »

A well-accented curse completed his thought and ended the sentence.

- Come on, come on, my dear! said Fitz Moore. These ladies are of my world, and let me tell you that you condemn them a little lightly. Who proves to you that they have not kept a fond memory of your poor comrade?

- Proofs ? I have just too many. At last ! Let them marry if it amuses them; but I ask your permission to find the wedding a little heavy, when poor Leopold dies in the province of Biskra! »

Gougeon nodded to Fitz Moore and answered for him, in a more friendly tone:

“I understand you, Brunner. Friendship, devotion, regrets are the most honorable things in the world; but finally can you demand that life eternally mourn death? The friend you miss, who we would probably miss too, if we had known him...

- Oh ! Yes !

"This friend," I said, "whom you see still expiring, has ceased to suffer for two good years." Do you think it fair that all his family?… Even if the thing could benefit him, to him! But no. I go further: I say that such a sacrifice he would not accept!

- It's possible.

— Let oblivion do its little work.

- He will not have work to do ... The ungrateful! My poor friend, their son, their brother, was forgotten alive. It is an atrocity that I have never told anyone; but since the first word is out, since Fitz Moore is defending the family, since the memories I had suppressed are suffocating me, the truth will have to come out. Listen. »

I
We knew each other in Biskra for a year, but intimacy hardly came until the sixth or seventh month. We had been told of a second lieutenant who came from Saint-Cyr, and who was a count. A new figure is always curious. If we weren't a small town in an oasis, where would we be? Some said: It is some protege who is placed among the native skirmishers so that he can advance more quickly; the others were preparing to lead him briskly, if he was too much of a gentleman. Four or five sons of families, more or less devastated in the gambling dens of Paris, were impatiently awaiting this reinforcement to found a branch in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. "You are very good children," I said to them; would a count who had four sous from home come to Biskra? The comments were exhausted,

I can still see him on horseback, preceded by a spahi and followed by the mule carrying his luggage. He was neither tall nor handsome, and he looked like a weak child. Not a hair of down on his thin little face, and a nose that the absence of mustaches made seem even longer. His strength failed him a little when he dismounted; you wouldn't have had to shake him very hard to make him faint. His friends in anticipation drove him or carried him to the accommodation they had reserved for him; he took a bath, went to bed, and did not reappear all day.

This unpacking of the doll amused the garrison. The contrast was really too funny between this second lieutenant of young ladies and the all-out lads he had come to command. All that day, in the cafe, at the club, in the streets, we approached each other saying: Have you seen the Turco  ? what do you think of the turkish? For a Turco, that's a funny Turco. The name remained with him for life, that is to say, for the year. Finally, even his brusher found this name easier to pronounce than that of Gardelux and called him respectfully: Sidi Turco.

The second impression was to his advantage. In the visits he made, in the welcome he offered us, in the ever so long hours of an idle garrison, he made himself better known and better appreciated. His politeness was cordial and without haughtiness; he associated himself from the start with our way of life and refused to stand apart with the gilded or degilded youth. We soon learned that he brought among us a great fund of goodwill and a fine military education. Entered the fiftieth at school, he had left it in the first twelve; it was he who had chosen the native skirmishers when the general staff was open to him. We see that he rode not like a schoolboy, but like a man who had his first pony at the age of four. The soldiers of his company, after having felt him a little, felt that he had a firm hand and obeyed him no more and no less than if he had been five feet six inches. In short, after six weeks, he was posed like no one in the Biskra garrison. Only the thin skins of his caste were surprised that a boy so well born, emancipated by authentic act and free to eat twenty-five thousand pounds of income, had nothing to tell them about these misses Amanda, Nina and Lobelia, from Paris. On this chapter he was almost new, or at least very discreet. I happened to overhear a sort of affair between him and a dancer from the Ouled-Nayl tribe; but I doubt that he kept it long, and especially that the heart was in the game. His heart was here, and oddly placed, as the sequel will prove to you. at the end of six weeks, he was posed like no one in the Biskra garrison.

Our friendship began with chess, where he was pretty strong: he gave me back the rook, me who's not a fool. To vary our pleasures, we rode on horseback, we hunted wild boar, we pushed reconnaissance towards the tomb of Sidi Oq'ba or the ruins of Zaatcha. We strolled through the town on foot in that fanciful uniform that we know: the long silk shirt falling to the feet, the slippers and the large straw hat peculiar to the chiefs of the south; nothing less, nothing more. When the heat was too strong, we went to bathe in one of those canals which water the roots of trees. I owned in common with nine or ten of my comrades a cage built at the top of three palm trees, twenty meters above the ground. You climbed it on leaving the bath by a rope ladder and stretched out on it like the rims of a wheel, your feet in the center, your heads on the circumference. This station placed between heaven and earth gave us ineffable siestas. In vain the thermometer marked forty-five degrees, our alcarazas gave us a few drops of cool water, and if some semblance of a breeze agitated the air, it was for us. In the evening, we sat in the niche of a Moorish cafe, or else the officers met in this marvelous circle of Aumale, where gazelles, ostriches and the most singular products of the desert acclimatize a little better. than in Paris. It may be said, it is a pretty garrison that Biskra; If only the water wasn't so bad! This station placed between heaven and earth gave us ineffable siestas.

What I liked above all in the conversation of the Turco was that I learned something there every day. You think you know a lot when you have spent ten years at college; that toddler who hadn't gone through school surprised me and humiliated me a little. Not that he was a man to brag about anything; he would rather hide from his knowledge: he needed the opportunity to loosen his tongue. A double Latin and Greek inscription on an indignantly corroded column amused him for a quarter of an hour. There you have it, watch in hand, the time he took to copy it, restore it and translate it on a sheet of his notebook. Me, I have arms, I dug up the column; but the devil if I could have deciphered the first word?

His brain was stuffed with curious things; by walking with him, I gradually learned about history, botany, what do I know? He knew Africa on principle better than I, an African for five years and a captain for three!… One day, he explained to me that the great desert was a dry sea, that water could return home sooner or later, that We could even bring it back there by a work analogous to the piercing of the Isthmus of Suez, because after all the Sahara is twenty-seven meters below the level of the Mediterranean! Did you know that? I was transported by it: my imagination took off; I spent the whole night dreaming of the construction of a great inland sea which would isolate our Algerian colony, would shelter us from nomads, would allow the French navy to land at Biskra, as at Oran or Philippeville, and on the other side would open tropical Africa to the explorers of my country! I had a fever. The next day, when I offered to undertake the affair between the two of us, he said to me with a smile: 'So you mean a lot of harm to the Scots and the Swiss? And he gave me the most curious theory about the glaciers of Europe which melt every year in the wind from the Sahara: if that wind were to run over the water instead of passing over the sand, it would arrive refreshed by the evaporation; the glaciers, no longer melting, would gradually spread, Switzerland and Scotland would be frozen, and the climate of France forever spoiled. You see, he knew everything; I found this later, in a book, exactly as he had told me. when I offered to the Turco to undertake the business between us, he said to me with a smile: "Do you really mean harm to the Scots and the Swiss?" And he gave me the most curious theory about the glaciers of Europe which melt every year in the wind from the Sahara: if that wind were to run over the water instead of passing over the sand, it would arrive refreshed by the evaporation; the glaciers, no longer melting, would gradually spread, Switzerland and Scotland would be frozen, and the climate of France forever spoiled.

Since his arrival, he hardly read. Newspapers hardly tempted him, and his library, which he bequeathed to me, consisted of nine volumes. On the other hand, he wrote a lot, for his supply of paper was exhausted in four months, and he often stopped at the shop of the Maltese Giovanni to buy more. Since he remained locked in his room at least one day a week, the assumptions were rife; some accused him of amorous correspondence, others presented him as a misunderstood poet or an anonymous journalist, still others as a sick man, subject to periodical bouts of melancholy. I, his friend, had made it a rule to respect the mystery, whatever it was; in short, I would never have guessed it, if it had not been revealed to me by a deplorable accident. Here is the fact.

At Biskra, the mail from France arrives every week; a bugle call announces the good news, all the officers run to the military circle, and there the postman opens this satchel of blessings. It's not to brag, because after all happiness doesn't always fall to the most worthy, but I have a lot of solid friends and a family the likes of which are no longer made. I don't write much, it's probably lack of ideas, but since I came into the world, I've had a lot of replies. Each week, I had five or six letters to read, sometimes nine or ten, when family and friendship had given each other the word. When the harvest was good, I went off proudly, spreading it out like a deck of cards and reading Mama Brunner's letter in a low voice: I never began with another; may the foundlings throw the first stone at me!One morning in September, the 4th, I will remember it for the rest of my life, I was rich with seven or eight letters. The good old woman over there sent me a note for five hundred francs; man is not perfect, and the Ouled-Nayl tribe does not yet know the theory of art for art's sake. Item , I was told from home a shipment of hams, sausages, Barr wine and kirschenwasser, which was to go up the mealfor a month. I was happy, I walked on my toes, I recognized out of the corner of my eye, while reading, the writing of my cousin Gretchen and my old friends on the other envelopes: I took refuge, to taste all these wines in good French ink, in the little eastern salon, at the end of the circle; Gougeon has been there, he can see it from here. I enter, and I see the Turco tearing up the strip of a newspaper, as a great extra, with a figure from the other world.

" Well ! I said to him thoughtlessly, what are you doing here? You weren't in the mail, so you don't have any letters today? »

He jumped at my throat like a little jaguar, and cried as he strangled me:

" You insult me ​​! what have I done to you? You know very well that no one writes to me! Oh Charles! Charlie! »

Thereupon, without giving me time to be surprised, he slipped through the window and fled crying. The military circle has only one ground floor, thank God.

I remained dumbfounded. I was his superior, he had laid hands on me: if anyone had seen us, he would go to a council of war; but I didn't think of that until the next day. My first impulse was to put the letters in my pocket and run to him to find out what and how I had hurt him. A rascal with smeared eyes threw the door in my face. This is how, incidentally, I learned of his affair.

The next day, at dawn, I was sleeping rather badly under my mosquito net, the door and the window open, when he woke me up by my name. I put on a gandoura , and I go to meet him. He kisses me, he cries, he stammers a lot of things where the word forgiveness came up all the time.

“You don't know,” he said, “you can't know…but I'll tell you everything. Charlie! I am the most unhappy of men. I love with all the strength of my heart, and no one even remembers me. It's Dante's frozen hell! »

I have since learned that Dante imagined a hell without fire.

He led me into the countryside, to the green devil. I will always see the landscape again. Did you notice that? When a happy or sad event drives a nail in the scene, it is fixed for life; we don't forget it anymore. Like the bean field where my cousin Gretchen... but let's not confuse the stories.

He began to tell me about his life with an abundance of heart! Ah! when a man saves everything in himself, there are times when he finds himself handsomely rich, come on! It was a debacle, an explosion, what do I know? imagine all that is stronger. A piece that would have been charged every day, at any time, since 1850, and that would now be lit! Do you hear the knock? It is to thrill. A boy more delicate, more tender and more sentimental on his own than Alsace and Germany put together, and who has never had either father or mother!

Her father, M. de Gardelux, was not a father. He was a gentleman who made people run. He had a stable at Chantilly, a dancer at the Opera; he was something at the club, treasurer or vice-president, I don't know; but life in Paris absorbed him so completely that he forgot the way to his hotel for twenty-four hours. His wife, married at fifteen, mother at sixteen, or supposedly such, had neither fed, nor brought up, nor known her son. Me, I nursed Mama Brunner until the age of four, and if you saw her, you'd agree with me that it didn't tire her. It must be said that in our country girls get married at twenty-five, in their strength. Stunted children are the ones we have too early. Thus Leopold's sister, born four years after him, is a superb person: those who doubt it have only to go and see him tomorrow at the church. It's a stone's throw from here, right, Fitz Moore?

All men are not cut from the same sheet, because I have been told that many people were born and lived like this unfortunate boy without feeling the slightest discomfort. They paid him a Burgundian nurse of the finest blood, visited by the family doctor; her layette was ordered from the big maker; he was weaned according to the rules of the art; they gave him a whole set of good foreign girls so that he could learn German, English and Italian without learning them. At the age of seven, like a prince, he left the hands of women and fell again under the control of a sweet little abbé, who called him monsieur le vicomte. A poor sire, that abbé, in spite of the fine letters and fine virtues with which the seminary had stuffed him! Penetrated by the feeling of his humility, he repeated to himself and to others that God had taken him from the plow to seat him under the paneling of the grown-ups: in this idea, he only sat down halfway, and when he had to walk on a rug, her big feet remained in the air as if to ask forgiveness from the beautiful flowers of dyed wool. Do you see a poor boy without parents, without comrades, without any other company on earth than a flat, reverent, candied abbot! How amusing Paris must be under these conditions! It is true that the child spent six months at the castle: it was the most bearable time of his life. They let him run, garden, climb trees, gallop for hours on end under the care of a reliable valet, the abbé not being a horseman for a farthing. It was at the chateau that Leopold got to know his family a little: he sometimes dined at table; we even called him to the living room to distract the company when the rain beat on the windows and we were in small groups. His awkwardness, his savage airs and his bewildered replies amused Madame la Comtesse and her intimate friends. When the little jester took the joke badly, they quickly sent him back to the abbé. Leopold told me that from the age of five he had considered suicide. You see, when we read in the newspapers that a toddler has hanged himself or cut his throat, we are perhaps wrong to pity the parents; I would start by putting them in jail, and then we would see.
