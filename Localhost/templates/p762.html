IN THE WIND WIND
I lean against Skanssi's door and try with my sleepy eyes to count how many porpoises are on the starboard side of the ship. There are ten, no, twenty. This counting is useless, for the whole flock of porpoises looks like a long sea serpent that, in the fantastic light of dawn, forms a frightening, shiny, and bubbling line. It is impossible to even guess their number, for who knows what the tail and head belong to. A swarm of porpoises effervesces the water into a foam from which a black-shiny head stands out, about five meters from which a tail gleaming happily - but isn't the porpoise so long? I yawn and close my eyes.

Not really sleeping me, as there is enough sleep available, otherwise only this sweet warm will bring a happy yawn to my lips.

Another yawn makes your eyes open again. They wander lazily at sea, bounce it from the gray surface back to the stubble, and finally ache step by step up into the sails. The sails are a gray mass that strangely vibrates as if excited by the good wind and favorable weather. Finally, the gaze ends up on the top sail of the front mast and the lazy body gets an unpleasant impulse. There's something crooked up there. Two of the mast rings of the top sail have squeaked as if tired on top of each other and are now pulling the sail into a wrinkle. It’s best to go up there before the mate sends, however, the trip will come there.

Climbing refreshes the bored mind, the feet cheering happily into the marching basket and from there still along the thick rims of the little finger to the top sail dwellings. A sudden kick in the tires and the sail gets its beautiful round shape again. It bulges with pride and I descend contentedly down to the basket. I will stay there to yawn, because there is no place in the hustle and bustle of the worlds. Such a mode of action is not known where the wind carries the ship steadily and surely forward like a coal steamer. I close my eyes, squeeze my legs firmly around the hoops and I think I take a nap. It 's sweet to be up here. The swaying, the sailor’s perpetual cradle, feels much more intense up here, the view widening into an open, shoreless outcrop, whose evenly intersecting skyline soothes the eye.

The sun rises from the bosom of the sea as a huge sight. It looks strangely flattened at first, rounds into a golden ball, and just before bouncing off the sea grows a golden foot that hangs on the surface of the sea for a moment, proving that the sun loves the depths of the sea. the sun now looks like a large golden baptismal font.

The golden foot breaks and the round glowing ball sends me towards the steady undulating surface of the sea of ​​light - maybe it wasn’t exactly meant just for me, but I still gratefully accept it, lifting my hat. A sweet feeling of contentment and gratitude overpowers the mind. The beauty of the world may only be reserved for completely blameless people, but for some reason the good Creator has spared a beautiful ripple of it for restless sailors, restless souls who truly long for this recreation. It revolves thoughts into new realms, the concept of beauty expands, a wonderful vision purifies the soul, and a series of thoughts rises from the heart to the brain, which in its final form is purely materialistic, full of the thirst for beauty and the delicate drunkenness of love. - If I still sent money home, if I leave half my salary to the captain? If I didn’t visit countries other than on Sundays? If I didn't hit a bitch? A simple soul may be intoxicated by beauty, but intoxication is not of a dangerous quality. It just brings good thoughts and tender feelings to the surface. I have once seen a hairy sailor claiming to be in pain every morning to admire the sight of a marching basket. The sunrise in the southern seas is a sweet reflection of the beauty of the world. It is not particularly rich in color, but in its enormity it makes the sailor feel his own smallness in this great universe. He senses it much better then than on a stormy night as he sways up the mast, when the slightest gust of wind sent by the Creator sends a man's whining momentum into black darkness ... - for beauty sensitizes the soul, danger only sharpens it at sea.

Upstairs, I thought about the evil and goodness of the world so eagerly that I could already hear eight glasses. It’s a sign of a change of guard and with one jump I’ve slid all the way to the deck.

Siellä tapaan miehet alastomina pesupuuhissa. Yksi kiskoo purjekankaisella sangolla suolaista, vilpoisaa vettä merestä ja kaatelee sitä vuoron jälkeen jokaisen niskaan. Alastomat, ruskeat ruumiit pyristelevät kuin kalat koukussa, ähkäisevät lisää vaatien ja ennenkuin minä olen saanut varusteeni yökylmää vastaan, paidan, lakin ja housut päältäni, ovat kylpijät mielihyvin raajojaan oikomassa auringon lämmittämällä keulakannella. Kansivahti ottaa sunnuntaipäivän työt sillä tavoin vastaan, me, vapaavahti, lähdemme auringonpaistetta tulvillaan olevaan skanssiin aamiaiselle ja sitten nukkumaan kannelle. Ensin kuitenkin mittaamme tarkoin mahdollisen varjon, laskemme, kuinka kauan varjokeila siinä paikassa viipyy, kuinka korkealle aurinko kiipeää ja sitten heitämme patjamme mahtavasti luukulle.

At noon, a shady place can no longer be found by searching, and sadly sighing, we go to the chef for a snack. Some receive, others do not, for a chef with a long mustache is a merciful lord against whom no bad word can be spoken. I get a bowl of beans and climb on the bow deck to mash them. There is now a void, as the people seem to have lost track of things to tell.

The captain paws on his day tour. Comes right in front of my bean bowl, but I just calmly keep eating. Small it will be master even on such a beautiful Sunday. Still, the funny gentleman he is, now, especially when he has nothing to do, is as if in his cabin or on the aft deck in the shade of a sun sail, exploring his magazine bench. Pleasure shines from his face and he graciously asks:

— Miksi et ongi, poikaseni? Saat minulta koukun.

Tämä pyyntö ei ole niin herttaisen epäitsekäs kuin ehkä saattaisi luulla. Ukko saa miehistölleen taas ilmaisen päivällisen, mutta koska pyynnön täyttäminen ei aiheuta minkäänlaista mielentasapainon häiriintymistä, haen koukun. Sanotaan, ettei koskaan voi olla kaikille mieliksi, mutta tässä tapauksessa väite kellahtaa selälleen. Yhtiö on tyytyväinen — rahaa säästyy — kapteeni on tyytyväinen koska yhtiö on tyytyväinen ja minä olen tyytyväinen, sillä kalastus on mielityötäni ja olisin tänään kuitenkin kalastanut. Kalat eivät mahda olla tyytyväisiä, mutta se on taas jo toinen juttu.

I crawled on the diameter boom temporarily crawled with my hand gently squeezed into my hand. There is a long line on the hook, at the end of which is a hook around which the captain has tied a piece of white plain torn from his sheet. I said he tore his sheet, for there is no other linen on the ship, except for a few happy landing shirts, which in turn are too precious to be used for this purpose.

The net under the boom is warm and smells of tar. It rests like the best bed. A breezy wind blows along the brown back, whistling entertainingly after reaching the mazes of the tropical hat. I open the line and let a seductive piece of rag intended to depict a flying fish fall over the edge of the net.

At the bottom, there is life in the turmoil formed by the bow. Dolphins, bonitoes and flocks of flying fish compete in baths in the throes of bow foam. At first glance, one does not realize the richness of color in the vision, but after a while, an exclamation of admiration comes from the lips.

Keulassa särkyvä vesi leviää hienonhienona pitsinä aaltojen pinnalle. Siinä on aluksi suuret silmukat ja paljon kiiltäväpintaisia vaahtopisaroita, mutta laivan kyljillä on se jo hienona utuna imeytynyt laineitten pintaan. Vesi on sinistä, vihreätä ja niin edelleen kerroksittain kunnes aaltojen pinnalle muodostuu pehmeänvihreä smaragdikerros, josta pyöreänenäiset delfiinit ottavat vauhtia syvemmälle sukeltaakseen. Delfiinit ovat litteitä kuin laudankappaleet ja vauhti on niillä hirvittävän nopea. Bonitot ovat pyöreämpiä, mutta vedessä sinisiltä kuultavat pyrstöt saavat ne sukkulana kiitämään. Lentokalat, pahaa aavistamattomat, iloiset lapsukaiset ovat kerääntyneet parveen aivan isompien veljiensä eteen, ja siitä heitä yksi toisensa jälkeen joutuu isonveljen vatsaan. Lentokalat hyppäävät riemuissaan korkeammalle, tuuli tarttuu niiden harittaviin eviin ja lentokoneen tavoin ne kiitävät välkkyvin siivin meren yllä, kunnes aurinko pahanilkisesti kuivattaa niiden siivet ja ne putoavat takaisin aaltojen syliin.

Isotveljet uida porhaltavat tyytyväisinä, vatsaan joutuneet eivät valita, ja minulla ei ole aikaa surra lentokalojen kohtaloa, sillä vedän räsykappaletta kiivaasti nykimällä pitkin aaltojen pintaa. Joko ovat delfiinien ja bonitojen silmät vanhuuttaan hämärät tai sitten vaahto tekee kaikki samannäköisiksi vedenpinnan yläpuolella, mutta innokkaasti koukkuani ahdistellaan. Yksi onnellinen sen saa ja tämän onnellisen, neljän kilon delfiinivenkaleen, vedän vaahdosta puomille. Saalis ei oikein pidä nostotavasta ja meillä on paljon erimielisyyttä selvitettävänä, ennenkuin saan siltä niskat nujerretuksi. Sitten se on hiljaa, vähän vain juutalaisnenän vieressä olevat herkät sieraimet pärskyttävät, ja komeassa kaaressa sinkoan saaliin kannelle. Siinä on kylliksi ja voin huoletta jäädä verkkoon loikomaan.

Puomille sinkoutuvat vesipisarat muodostuvat auringonvalossa häikäiseväksi sateenkaareksi, joka alkaa alhaalta vihreästä merenpinnasta ja ulottuu niin pitkälle kuin ilmaan sinkoutuvia vesipisaroita riittää. Toisinaan lentää niitä korkealle, toisinaan kyntää keula rauhallisesti tasaisempaa vettä ja silloin laskeutuu sateenkaari silmän alapuolelle. Tarkastelen tätä kaunista näkyä pää nuokkuen sateenkaaren keinumisen tahdissa ja herään mietteistäni vasta Billin tullessa seuraa pitämään.

— Näetkö Tahitia tuolla? hän kysyy. Keulan puolelle on tosiaan ilmestynyt maata.

Etäisyydessä siintää kartionmuotoinen vuori, joka tuntuu hyppivän autereisessa ilmassa. Sininen usva peittää saaren huipun ja joskus luisuu koko näky silmästä pois ikäänkuin ei maata olisikaan.

— Täällä on kaunista, sanon huoaten.

- It's beautiful, admits Bill. I was born in Apia, in the islands of Samoa, and sailed a short time in these waters. This whole world is mine - and Bill spreads his hands mightily. My son, it should stay here. You rent one coral island and grow coconuts on it. You buy a small cutter and use it to sail your prey to Papete. No worries about tomorrow then; from the island you get everything, fruit, roast beef, wild piglets, wild goats, turtle eggs you will ever need. You build a hut on the edge of the lagoon, you take the eukon and you live like a lord. I'll be back here again.

Bill speaks wise words and I have a burning desire to settle here. It would allow the world to go its own way, forget here for the rest of its life, and enjoy a paradise that was once taken away from us, but whose scars were scattered on these waters. Once it’s so close, why not stay completely?

The thought stops here, slams into place, and the cessation due to the swinging movement no longer allows for thinking. Here, under the eternal sun and blue sky, at least the good side of the supply is that thoughts get tired in the middle. No need to bother your head, just yawn and peek into the sky. It is good to be, therefore, why think in vain, in the past and in the future. Yes, they do come up sometimes. Now just head empty and a sweet yawn grin in your mouth, here, where your whole life begins and ends with a long yawn.

I listen to the quiet, mournful natin of the booms. It is mixed with the Kalina of boilers from below. The smell of food spreads all the way to the boom and my fond memories come to mind. That’s how I used to sleep on my little home and was just as good as being. Even then, there was a sound of pots in the boiler, and a hungry stomach stirred the cloudy steam, which, as my mother lifted the lid of the boiler, spread out as far as the lawn, where I was loud and listening to the ringing of Sirkka and the hum of hay. Equally soft was my sleeping position, even so relaxed feelings took over my mind and I felt ready to embrace the whole world. Even so now - I would have wanted the whole world beside me on the boom, I would have shown the beauty of the tropical sea and spoken a few words about the trade wind that gives the sailor a foretaste of the expected sky;

The clock on the back deck flutters softly. I'm leaving the helm. I grab the stroller and ski down the wave handsomely, play down. The mind is filled with a sense of greatness. I just steer this ship and no one else. I intentionally turn the bow off course just to show that I can turn the whole big ship in the direction I want with a few finger movements. As the bow rises to the crest of the wave, I stumble instinctively, as if the entire front of the ship, rising as a steep wall in front of me, would fall on top of me. As the bow sinks into the wave, I rise proudly high with the stern. My neck straightens and I proudly look at the world below that goes where I want to direct it. The sails are full and there is a slight trembling trembling along their surface, the rays of the sun racing in the black monotony of the tackle, and the hot lid sends a vibrating heat wave up into the spaces. The masts oscillate and bend in the ripple of the air and take on strange shapes. All the objects on the deck lose their fixed contours and get into a strange swaying motion. It is useless to follow the swings of the compass needle, because you already know about the plumpness of the sails whether the ship is on course or not.

The night is coming, the sun is already gone and the stars are shining. I seek the cross of the South from the sky and stare at it relentlessly. It seems a bit crooked, maybe many of its admirers have ripped it too often towards the country with their thoughts? The stars are wonderfully bright, much brighter than there at home.

The power of the night makes thoughts wander in global affairs. Who and who can live in that star? Maybe there are seas and a ship right out there, so far away from the rest of the world, that even thoughts need seven-pound boots to get home and return from there. Maybe a dreamer like this leans on a beard there too?

The coxswain pains at the helm of his pajamas and, at the sound of the rudder, splits the hustle and bustle of the night and the silent moan of the ship's hull.

From afar, on the other side of the world, is the scout's mourning cry:

- All is well, sir!

I pick up my mattress and throw myself on the door.ELIAS, THE COOK
"Amy Turner" landed completely sailed from the lagoon opening. The sailor on the shore would probably have admired the quick wrapping of the sails, so smoothly and quickly it went. "Amy's" masts were revealed in a matter of minutes, and upon receiving the signal, the carpenter dropped the anchor into the ball of water.

There was no captain like the old man in these waters, no schooner who would have stayed in the wake of "Amy Turner" for a day. The ship had earned its reputation in the conquest of the pearl shells of Patolo. Twelve ships departed by mutual agreement from Auckland for sailing at the same time. Whoever gets there first would be the owner of the shirts. "Amy" had already cleaned the mussels the other day when others dropped their anchors off the reef. Now the ship was already old and one good impulse to the coral reef would have torn it to pieces, but that impulse never came, Husband Landen was too wise to do so. He had his own cards and "Amy" had often counted between the reefs with the power of mentions. In a couple of minutes, the canoe would have been crushed in the same place.

We were in Papete, a very lovely island in Tahiti, waiting for a copral cargo. The season hadn’t started yet, but we knew that in just a week, the sandy bottom of the lagoon would be full of countless anchors.

There were many of us on the ship, from the black Negro to the pale-faced Tasmanian fairy boy, whose milky-white skin shone away from the sun's rays. The deal was the best, we were the first sailors on the first ship of the archipelagos - no one imagined getting our noses to jump. We were lords of red, as the saying goes.

The sun was at its highest as the anchor fell into the clear water. The heat felt incubating and the pitch boiled in the cracks in the lid. The water looked cool sweet and a palm grove on the edge of the lagoon promised the delights of paradise. The natives came to the shore to wash their clothes, a little further afield the dark princes of the island flocked to the shores of the shore, and there was a buzzing sound from the city that actually came from the factory, but which for the first time felt like a siesta of city dwellers. The steady buzz seemed like a silent order to go into the shade to rest, and most seemed to comprehend it, but the lightest ones were preparing to land.

Here, thank God, no clothes are needed. A white shirt, blue trousers, half-shoes and a hat are skilfully tilted - a suit that will charm Aissoja and Yvonne. We were on a high course without a jacket. The hosts and girls of the taverns had been pondering for many weeks how to satisfy our desire for amusement; they had stocks, we had money, and before the evening sun would fall behind the palm trees, Papete's police would have a lot to do. In the police prefecture, copra time was expected with fear and trembling. There was a reason, but the five of us cared…

So there was a cry of liberation, "Go ashore!" The fairy boy rowed and the pose was awesome. The other happy ones, Charley, the chef and I drifted into a sweet dream. There is hardly anything more exciting than a first visit to a port city after a long and strenuous trip.

The easy-going man was Elias, the cook. His life story would have been just as laid back if a bottle of liquor hadn’t been found in the world.

The chefs are a remarkable crowd. When you see them in a cramped galley tasting important and wise soup, you wouldn’t believe they have worldly passions and thoughts either. Human fallacy! The chefs are real wolves in sheep skins and here I am going to prove it.

There were times when Elias took the height of both the morning sun and the evening sun through the bottom of the bottle; there were times when the little ones drove him up to the marching basket to ask for help from the angels sitting there, and there were times when the blue and red lizards wandered in front of Elias cowardly waving their tails, but even then it would be wrong to call him a potter. He took a booze, twenty, but sometimes remained a water boy for decades. However, he was the kind of man he prefers to see in a little hutika. Clearly, they are dry and stiffened like capsule bars, but pour three good drops of rum into the waiting throat! Then the rusty joints will be released, the sky will open and they will embrace the whole world. The language, which had been so depleted before, had turned into a flow of words, from which you differ nothing but - let me add - this is how we dance in Venezuela and that’s how they jump frogs in the rice fields of Osaka. Hih! The eyes rotate, the ears swing and the legs pound like drum blocks to the beat of the anchor chain natina. They speak all evening in their entire month’s vocabulary. This is how sweetness and human love fall on them, and only then can the evening be with them.

Puosu led us to the pier and from there along the familiar paths to Café Montmartre, located on the outskirts of the city, on the edge of the gloomy jungle. The cafe was the kind of clay shack you’ve seen in pictures in geography textbooks with “Mexican hut in the sunshine” below, but this had a wide veranda as a special attraction and exactly six and a half windows as draw holes with many purposes. The owners escaped the biggest ones at the start of the "free for all" fight, the steam from them and the little rapper evaporated into the temperate night air, and from one of the biggest windows Elias flew into the ginger field, but that doesn't belong here yet.

Puosu introduced us to the hostess, the peasants and the gingerbread-colored guests, and finally to the host, who had the most striking face on this side of the equator. Ms Morineau flew around our necks, as Ms Morineauk would have done , but by then we were already too firmly attached to the house's belongings, so the intention was just an enthusiastic pat on the hands. The chef winked at Yvonne, Suzanne flew an arrow around her neck, and one of the natives began to swear to her a friendship that, judging by her speech, would be as tough as a coconut shell if I didn’t soon offer her half of Kapaka’s stock. The crew of "Amy Turner" had arrived and the joy belonged to the police prefecture.

The boys soon brought another load, and it was barely an hour before the already crackling dance shook the windows. Yvonnet, Suzannet, Muriel, Ah-poot, and Ah-moot jumped between the roof and the floor an orchestra of one banjo, one strange vehicle, and two pagans, hovering over anything that might have been between the march of the Porites and Apache's death song. At least it wasn't dance music, because that kind of dance hasn't been invented yet. The bottles danced on the shelves, the host danced on the table, one gingerbread under the table, and the messenger was already dancing outside, where a full room had thrown him. The palm trees swayed to the beat of the music, the lizards came out from under their roots to hear the evening concert, and the cops were playing deaf-mute on the moonlit streets of Papete. It was now up to them to control the moon, because - "

The chef, Elias, was on his mind. He had already rotated a little bit of everyone and finally grabbed Mlle Yvonne Cherrier by the neck. The sheepskin had long since fallen from his shoulders, and a bolder sailor has never stood in the realm of Morineau. The shirt had worn off, the hat had gone all the way to the world, and the world was spinning like a fluttering ball in his eyes. He was already too brisk, so brisk that Yvonne's intoxicating earlobes made him grab the only chair in the house, its third and last leg. One flick, two flicks, and gingerbread felt very small in this wormy world.This was an unfortunate interruption. The rest of us were just getting excited. Centuries-old traditions were followed and Elias was sent with a fiery kick through the window directly to the moon. Peace returned and accompanied by gingerbread under the serving table. It may not have been a very decent one, but at these latitudes the blood is in a rumbling motion, compared to which a Nordic outburst of emotion is like a snail walking in a tar barrel.

Midnight came and the enthusiasm gradually waned. Puosu suggested moving out to our brave home, and we left as precious, yet after cheering endless times in honor of "Amy Turner." We were boys, we were!

The boat was already leaving when the boar arrived at the dock. The distance was about five meters, but the bush took it with a triple jump. The first step was already enough, we handed the oar to him, and so came the deck in decent order on the deck of "Amy". The dream tasted great to everyone except the boys, who thought Suzanne's gentle gaze was meant exclusively for her.

The chef had had his own adventure, but we only heard about it the next day when the police chief's uniform appeared on the beard. Oh, that Sacre sailor had done a rage! Had fought with every opponent, had beaten his dignity in the chair of Gendarmerie Guiraud and then beaten M. Le Bellion's honorable head against the clay wall of the police station. This beast in human form had then tried to break into the apartment of an honorable citizen, but the door had been locked. He had then smashed all the windows and calmed down only after receiving a couple of well-thrown coconuts on his head. And, complained a fat representative of the government, then had dared to flee, even though he had been legally detained by the entire police force united and allied with Papete. This is the third content, if that unfortunate one would be hanged today. M. Guiraud lay in the hospital and the whole city cried out for revenge. Oh, that beast must be captured right away!
