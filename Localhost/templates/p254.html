he forerunner of today's book binding is the diptych used in Roman antiquity and in the Middle Ages . It consisted of two writing-tablets of wood or ivory covered with wax, held together by metal rings or strips of parchment, and used to be richly decorated on the outside with carvings. From the time when parchment manuscripts became common and larger in size, however, the layers were attached to strips of parchment with twine in such a way that the thread pierced through the break in the layer from the inside around the strips of parchment, just as in more recent times around and returned to the inner side.

This is how the so-called Bund came about, which is still common today for all volumes that are bound together.

One will hardly be mistaken if one assumes that the emergence of today's book form coincides with the beginning of Christianity, while previously the papyrus scroll was primarily used for the production of manuscripts. The layers of the parchment sheets were called terns, quaterns, quinterns and sexterns, depending on the number of double leaves inserted into each other. The number four, however, must have been the most common, for afterwards the position was simply always referred to as quaterne, and the modern French term for heft — cahier — (quayer in Old French) developed from quaternus.

[4]

The expression velin, vellum or velum commonly used today by experts for calf parchment is the designation for the Latin membranae, which Paul mentions in his letter from Timothy (II) (τὰς μεμβράνας).

The ivory cover, which was customary for manuscripts and was considered particularly valuable and whose origin can be traced back to the diptych of antiquity, was replaced over time by wooden panels, which, however, were also made into works of art by rich decoration with metal, precious stones, etc. In the second part of this work we shall come back to the historical development of the book cover in more detail.

In order to better hold the layers sewn together on strips of parchment, a wide piece of leather was used, with which half or a third of the spine and the two wooden covers on the sides were usually glued over. The binding straps (parchment strips) were pulled through the lids in this process. The Middle Ages did not know the manual production of bindings. On the contrary, each book writer in the monasteries was his own bookbinder, and the help of the goldsmith or the ivory carver was only enlisted for more valuable volumes.


Fig. 1. Soft cover with flap. 14th century and earlier.

The paper, known to the Chinese long before Christ, was brought to us by the Arabs as they spread across the shores of the Mediterranean in the eighth and ninth centuries. In the Orient it was the only writing material, and everything that has come down to us from works of Oriental literature is written on this material. At a time when we were still writing on parchment, the most beautiful miniature paintings were already being made in the Orient on paper that left nothing to be desired in terms of firmness and smoothness. With the introduction of paper came the trimming of the rough edges and with it the rounding of the spines, which made the outer shape of the book more pleasing. The usual manuscripts in the monastic libraries initially had only parchment covers long enough on both sides to be beaten over each other. The back side then usually ended in a point, a kind of triangular flap, to which ribbons or straps were probably sewn in order to be able to wrap and tie the whole thing several times (1 ).

The transition from these soft volumes, which up to[5]15th century, to the later ones, provided with laterally protruding wooden covers, refers to a kind of protective cover, which is still preserved in many examples from the 15th century. The volume is sewn onto leather bands to which previously leather-lined covers are attached. However, the outer leather cover is not folded inwards, but protrudes so far in all directions that it completely covers the edges of the sheet - one may not say cut just yet. For better attachment, it is sewn to the bound edges ( Fig. 2 ).

So we are already seeing a very noticeable change, while the guiding thought - protection against the ingress of dust - remained the same. The book bag should also be considered on this occasion . Designed in a similar way to the volume just mentioned, this form of binding only differs in that the protruding leather on the undercut is extended so far that it can be gathered at the end and tied in a knot; this knot carried a metal ring for attachment to the waist belt.

We know of a whole series of pictorial representations of the book bag on paintings, miniatures, wood carvings, etc., but in reality only five book bags are known so far, the most beautiful of which is in[6]Nuremberg (Anzeiger d. Germ. Mus. 1862, column 324) the others in Munich, Nuremberg, Frankfurt a/M. (v. Bethmann) and are located in Düsseldorf.

As a result, this protruding leather fell away; it is neatly folded around the edges, yes, it is quite possible that the protruding part of the book bag itself was cut off, provided there was no longer any reason to carry the book with you as traveling property. With that we have come to the form of the binding which, by and large, is still in use today.

 the time when manuscripts were mainly produced in monasteries by literate monks, who were often also artists and provided the script with colorful ornaments, initials and miniatures, the need to protect the manuscript by covering it remained reserved for the craftsmanship of the monastery brothers.

The manual operation of bookbinding naturally only began with the invention of the printing press. The printed sheets came, as is still the case today, raw (in albis) to the bookbinder. Since the smoothing press was not known, the bookbinder first had to smooth the paper that had become rough due to the pressure. To do this, he used the »sledge hammer«. The technical term for this preparatory work was: to hit out of position or to hit out of the fold . Starting from the middle, the layer was treated end to end towards the edge. As a result, the pressure subsided and the (handmade) paper, which was thicker in the middle, was beaten together vigorously and a more even thickness was achieved. The iron sledgehammer weighed up to twelve pounds[8th]Weight. A block of stone, the upper surface of which was ground, served as the base for the paper layer. In the absence of this, cast plates embedded in a block of wood were also used. Even today, the hammer and stone are still widely used tools, although they have become almost completely superfluous due to the smooth and firmly satinised machine paper and the use of suitable machines.

Another preparatory work was the leveling of the raw printed sheets, which now only occurs exceptionally, a work that must precede the beating. The printing paper used to be unsized, probably mainly because unsized paper accepts the printing ink more easily. In order to give such paper a better hold and "grip," before binding it is soaked with boiling glue water, which, in order to prevent the sheets from sticking together, contains alum during the boiling process, which results in the glue becoming saponified.

In addition to the alum, other substances were also added to the leveling water, such as iron vitriol or a coloquinte decoction, which was intended to prevent worm damage, which is particularly destructive in the Orient - hardly with success.

The best leveling water for printing papers consists of 1/2 lb. of glue (best light colognes) which is soaked in water for 24 hours and boiled, together with 4 liters of boiling water. In order that all impurities may be eliminated, the glue-water is poured through coarse burlap or a colander, into which ½ lb. of alum has previously been poured. With this solution, the printed paper is pulled through layer by layer, each about 5 sheets thick, or inserted for some time until it is soaked. The vessel in which the glue water is kept should be flat and not made of oak, as this gives off wood acid which gives the paper a yellow glow. In all cases, the best remains a large trough of wood or metal, such as that used by the butchers.

Once all the printed sheets have been leveled, they are freed from excess water by squeezing them out. After papers that have come loose at the top and bottom have been presented for protection, the damp sheets are placed on the so-called leveling board . This is a strong board provided with ledges all around, the purpose of which is to protect the board from being repeatedly soaked against being pulled, and to collect the water that comes out during pressing, which is then discharged through an opening designed for this purpose . The board has a size of about 40 to 60 cm. The water is pressed out using a stick or hand press. The large stick press has been well known since ancient times, as long as one can follow the work of pressing at all [9]in the arrangement used for pressing, and the smaller hand press . The first consists of two strong boards which are pressed together by means of a lever bar. The hand press consists of two press beams that are screwed together by means of nuts that can be rotated on spindles. ( Fig. 4. ) The hand press also includes the press bar , a handle for tightening or opening the nuts.


Fig. 4. Hand press with press boy.

Lately, the large stick press, but made of iron, has been put to more use again; every machine shop that makes bookbinding machine tools supplies these presses with two or four columns, depending on the force to be exerted.

If you want to press something, it has to be between boards which are called median, folio, fourth, twelfth or sedez boards, depending on their size. Depending on the course of the grain, we distinguish lengthwise or crosswise boards from each of these varieties. All press boards should be made of pear, maple or beech. None of the soft woods are suitable for this purpose, nor is wood with very hard annual rings, such as oak wood. The purpose of the press boards is always to press something flat and smooth, and for this reason they should be smooth and even themselves. Therefore, care must be taken when handling this tool to preserve the original smoothness of the surface.

If one now has to press in leveled pressure, it is unavoidable that the press boards become soaked through, that paper remains, glue or other impurities cling to them. It is therefore advisable to have special press boards ready for this work in order to protect the others. When pressing in with the hand press, make sure that the direction of the press beam crosses the grain of the top boards, otherwise the boards would crack or even break.

If the leveled print or leveler is pressed out in a stick press, it is sufficient to place the leveling board described above in the bottom of the press, pile up the leveled sheets in the middle, place a leveling press board on top of the whole and[10] now tighten. Of course, it gets a little more complicated with the hand press; there the wet leveler is also layered in the same way, but not lifted into the press, as we will see later in other works, but the whole thing is pulled a little over the edge of the table and the open wooden press is placed in such a way that a beam is underneath , the other comes to lie over the end to be pressed in, and now you gradually tighten both nuts, which you had previously tightened lightly by hand, alternately using the press bar. If you now tilt the press a little to the side where the water outlet opening is in the underlay leveling board, you can let the water drain out into a pot or bowl placed underneath.

Now it is not necessary to dry the wet print. This is done on strings or on triangular slats, on which the bows are hung, also in layers 4 ⁄ 6 sheets thick. The bookbinder used to hang up such wet prints in his workshop. The result was that his tools rusted and he and his workers felt uncomfortable for a few days each time. Today, when this work has become a rarity, it will certainly be possible to find a place in the attic where a few strings can be stretched to hang the bows.

In the days when there was still a lot of leveling to dry, leveling cloth made of spun horsehair was used, which does not absorb moisture and is very easy to keep clean, while hemp cloth must be washed very frequently to avoid dark streaks on the paper want. With the lines stretched low, the wet print was hung over the left arm, and the right hand peeled off one layer after the other, and hung them up so that each layer somewhat covered the end of the preceding one; this was for a good reason that, after drying, the layers could be pushed together end to end on each line. With high-tension lines that cannot be reached by hand, the leveling cross was used, a slat, rounded at the top, fastened at right angles to a pole, with which the layers were lifted and lowered onto the line.

If, when hanging up, it turns out that individual sheets are not completely soaked in water, they must be immediately removed and placed in boiling hot water. Otherwise a stain would form at the waterline, besides leaving the unmoistened piece of paper unsized and easily sticking to other sheets. The boiling water pulls the glue out of the paper again; it goes without saying that such sheets are dried and the work of gluing[11]must be repeated. More common than this mistake is tearing wet sheets and patching them upis not pleasant. Patching something well and unobtrusively is a special art that requires great patience and meticulous cleanliness. It is always advisable to patch the print after it has dried, because then you can work more neatly and the individual pieces are easier to handle dry than wet . There are two types of mending: putting one on top of the other and bumping with paper. The first way is the best, as afterwards one notices almost nothing, or at least little, when one has worked neatly; unfortunately this can only be done when the nature of the damage permits it. If a tear has occurred, so that the separate parts are to a certain extent separated from each other, i.e. each part encroaches somewhat on the other, then each of the two parts is smeared thinly with very clean paste and using a clean bone folder, or, as the expert says, "leanly" at the break point, the two parts fitted exactly onto one another and rubbed down in such a way that a clean sheet of paper is obtained Paper underneath, put one over the patched area and now carefully rub the whole thing, especially the broken area, with your fingertips. Under no circumstances should you rub it with a bone folder; this would drive the paste out of the joints and make the patchwork appear untidy from the start. just put one over the patched area and now carefully rub the whole thing, especially the broken area, with your fingertips. Under no circumstances should you rub it with a bone folder; this would drive the paste out of the joints and make the patchwork appear untidy from the start. just put one over the patched area and now carefully rub the whole thing, especially the broken area, with your fingertips. Under no circumstances should you rub it with a bone folder; this would drive the paste out of the joints and make the patchwork appear untidy from the start.

If we now assume the less favorable case that the break goes straight through, but fortunately the paper is unprinted on both sides at the break point, then you can very well glue a strip of paper to this unprinted area after the two break edges have been given some strong paste and exactly collided. Now it is of course inadmissible to glue a strip of paper firmly to this tear; but you can help yourself by placing a piece of paper, matching the material and color as closely as possible, over the broken fold and a clean piece of waste paper over it, and then rubbing the whole thing down with your fingers. The result will be that the paste not only holds the broken part of the paper together, but that the strip of paper also partially sticks to the patched area. After it has dried completely, this paper is carefully torn off in such a way that the paper itself splits and only individual fibers of the material remain, just enough to reinforce the damaged area accordingly. Even if the paper is printed on both sides at the breaking point, you can proceed in a similar way, but you have to use tissue paper to put it on, which you tear off very carefully after it has dried.

We now have the leveler dry and want to press it in firmly for a while so that it folds better, after we have of course[12] have all the sheets quite evenly, wrinkle-free and layered on top of each other. So we have plenty of leisure to make a few more comments about the "beating" from which work we had to make the detour to level.

We distinguish the light hitting or "pumping" and the actual hitting. The purpose of the former is to reduce the thickness of the paper only to a large extent. The layers can therefore be stronger than in the other case. This work probably got its name from the peculiar hollow noise. But if you want to attack the paper more severely and if its thickness is to be properly limited, then you have to divide it up into much thinner layers. But this only happens after folding; we are therefore postponing further discussion of this until after this work and first take our printed sheets out of the press.

If we extract any sheet from a printed work, we usually find the page numbers given above the text. However, it would cause some difficulties for the bookbinder to immediately find out from the page numbers which is designated as the first page of the sheet and accordingly to fold the sheet in the correct page sequence. Therefore, in the so-called signature , which the typesetter applies, an arrangement has been made that allows the front sheet of each sheet to be recognized immediately. So the attentive worker will not be able to easily 'false'. The signature shows the order of the arcs as 1, 2, 3, etcor (earlier) with the letters a, b, c etc. at the foot of the page on the right and the number on the first sheet is repeated with an asterisk in the same place on the second sheet (the so-called false signature).

If you fold a blank sheet of paper, you will line it up edge to edge. This is different with printed paper; the white margin is completely secondary for the folder, his task is rather to line up the individual columns of the print, ie the areas occupied by the typeface, so that they coincide when you hold them up to the light. At the end you place the sheets to be folded in a pile that is not too thick in the middle of the workbench in such a way that the right signature is at the top left on the underside, the wrong oneSignature is located at the top right on the top of the fold sheet. The right hand, which at the same time guides a bone folder, grasps the sheet at the right edge roughly in the middle and folds it over to the left so that the edges are roughly even. But at the moment when the right half of the sheet arrives on the left, the left grips it in such a way that the index finger comes to lie between the leaves near the corners of the column, while the thumb and middle finger grip it from the outside[13]grasp, bring the sheet to about eye level and adjust it so that the columns coincide exactly; the right hand helps with this work by pushing the two halves of the bow back and forth without putting the bone folder away ( Fig. 5 ). When the columns are in the correct position, the bow is laid down, and while the left hand is still holding it, the right strokes down the fracture to be formed vigorously and with a sure stroke, from below upwards, using the bone folder with the point is held slightly obliquely to the top left ( Fig. 6). So that the sheets can be picked up easily, the folding bone is occasionally stroked halfway up to the right, whereby the uppermost sheets are pushed out a little over the others in this direction, so that the right hand follows the respective top sheet can grab. This would be the first "tempo" to talk to our German non-commissioned officers, and it would really not be bad to learn this work, which with a little practice can be done extremely quickly, "loaded blind after counting" in a completely military sense; meanwhile, however, let us endeavor to make the second movement and to finish folding the sheet.

Fig. 8. Bending down the second fracture.

By placing the bone folder in the area of ​​the center bar under[14]pushes the break just made, one grasps the sheet with folding bone and forefinger in such a way that with a short turn of the hand one can grasp the sheet between forefinger, thumb and middle finger, or rather that the latter two are wrapped around in the sheet can form a fracture around the former ( Fig. 7). At this moment the left hand grasps the bow on the other side with the thumb, closes it together with the right, but draws it shut with a short grasp on the worker's body, while the right raises its side and brings it to eye level, to be able to line up the page numbers exactly. This happens when the eye looks into the arch from above. The left hand has meanwhile left the lower part of the bow and grasped the outside of the upper edge with the index finger between the thumb and middle finger to assist in straightening in the same way as with the first break. If the page numbers match exactly, then the two upper edges of the sheet are aligned exactly to each other in order to create an exact right angle with the first fraction (8 ). The sheet is now placed on the board, as above, and the fold is drawn down from top to bottom by holding the bone folder with the tip a little to the left and down to the side. With quarto format (8 pages) it is[15]the folding work ended, while in the octave format (16 pages) the last-mentioned movement is repeated once more. It should be noted that, especially with strong paper, the air can easily get caught in the first folded pages and if you brush them down quickly, creases will appear in the paper. The worker must try to counteract this evil with caution.

The folded sheet is placed aside with the left hand to the left, in the same position it was last in, i.e. with the spine to the right, page numbers at the top. If the printed sheets were already completed or sorted in copies before folding, they must be put away upside down, i.e. upside down, but also lying with the spine to the right, otherwise the sheets would appear laid from back to front and would have to be rearranged afterwards will.

Lately the folding work is also done by means of machines; but the machine has not yet been able to fully replace the human hand in this work, because its operation requires special attention and, in terms of the speed of the work, it only slightly surpasses a practiced folder.

Formats smaller than octave size are relatively rarely printed these days. With Duodez, 8 more columns (4 sheets) are printed, which have to be cut off and inserted into the sheet. To do this, you either have to fold the printed part with a fold or, as the saying goes, "bend" it and cut it off with a knife, or you take the sheet "on needles" and then cut off the part in question. Between the main sheet and the insert sheet there is a punctured area on both sides, the so-called puncture, which the printing press produces when the sheets are pulled over the roller. If one lays the sheet on a table or a board and drives a strong needle vertically through each of the two puncture holes, one is very well able to bring all the sheets on top of each other exactly according to the print, if one puts them individually on these needles "put on" with the punctures. If you have a sufficient number in this way - about 50 pieces - the insert sheets can all be separated from the main sheet with a sharp knife and an iron ruler in one cut. Both parts are now folded separately, the smaller one inserted into the larger one, facing exactly the same at the top.
