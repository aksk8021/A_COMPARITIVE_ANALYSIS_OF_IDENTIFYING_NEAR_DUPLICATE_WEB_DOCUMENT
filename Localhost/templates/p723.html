"You think you've reached faith with the gesture of an actor!" Ah! you really belong to the race of people who ask women to sacrifice themselves first, who ask their God to die for them first, and who forget to love the suffering being or the God who dies! If you want to touch Christ, love him before greeting him like a monkey! love him before discounting his sacrifice! Mutt! mutt! I still prefer the man who enjoys a beautiful body without looking any further, or who believes in a mechanical God who started the world and no longer cared! »

I was exasperated against Cigogne.

He replied in a lamentable voice:

" I will not be able ! I will not be able ! I need pain to be happy! I would have to see the seven wounds of Christ to believe in him!…”

And I wonder if my friend Cigogne isn't once again writing literature.

CHAPTER XXVII
From the lavender notebook.

I could not any more ! he had truly exceeded all permissible measure. I had to take a decision, perhaps a useless attempt, mad, no doubt, certainly inappropriate, but, I repeat: I couldn't take it any longer!

Who is Mr. Serval? I know nothing about him except through Roger's letters, and it is rare for Roger's judgment to be made, since he bases it, each time, on his momentary impression, like little children who say "This one is beautiful! this one is ugly! this one is nasty! Nevertheless, he always spoke of M. Serval as a gallant man, very cultured, a talented painter, it seems.

So… was I right? Alas! must wait.

For the past few days, Roger's letters have been breaking my heart. He does not like me ! he doesn't respect me! he takes me for one of those café-concert girls who used to amuse him. Ah! I would rather be called "Madam Stork!" That would only be grotesque, but… Florimonde! What dump did it drag on, Florimonde?

Everything we loved he forgets, worse still, he ridicules or spoils. He thinks he is someone else; he has found his way, he assures me; I must follow him… Where then? He does not say it ! But what he says in clear words, in sentences that hurt, is that the past no longer counts. The life we ​​led, with his good evenings, his long quiet chats, the thousand occupations which filled the day, our projects, our reading, our walks, his chemistry work which sometimes absorbed him so much, in which he showed himself so diligent , our delicious little vacation trips, this happiness no longer exists!

In his opinion, we cannot, living alone, live happily! A child… I wanted it as much as he did, maybe more, since he admitted that the presence of a child between us frightened him, but when I was so ill and that hope had to be given up … (September 18… how I suffered!) he seemed sincerely sorry. He spoke of the child as if he had known him. He cried. His pain was touching. He consoled me with words so sweet, so skilful, so tender! "Later, when you're cured, Lucienne," he would say to me, "we'll have another dream, and the dream this time will be a little girl!" Alas! I haven't completely cured myself! How charming he was then!

I remember my old cousin Charlotte, always disagreeable and sharp, even saying that a well-bred man should not speak openly about an accident of this kind, nor take it so much to heart, since the good Lord had it. desired.

Well, in his letter of yesterday, Roger dares to write to me: “We are no longer very young, Lucienne; our middle age will be sad, without a real home, but I won't think about it anymore if you become Florimonde, I'll forget that child's voice that pursues me, the voice of the one we would have named Marguerite, right? not ? Become Florimonde! be crazy! look at yourself, recognize yourself in the portrait of Pélaze, and, for the new woman that you will then be, I (I am already) a new man. »

What do these abominable phrases mean and why "Marguerite?..." We had never thought of this name for our child... I cried all night and when Mahoudiaux came to lunch this morning, around eleven o'clock, I begged to write to Roger's friend, to this M. Serval, to ask him to explain all this.

So I saw how awful common sense can be!

“My dear friend,” said Maurice, “such nonsense is not worth listening to; why inquire into their cause? These are the common deviations of a man who is bored and who likes to dream through…”

I didn't think Maurice was so stupid, because there's something else he doesn't want to see, he doesn't want to feel. In short, he refused to help me. So I thought long and hard all afternoon, and after dinner I wrote myself!

What a letter, my God! which letter ! and what foolishness to have addressed it to this stranger! What will he think of me? Will he just answer? Will he not show it to Roger, in spite of my earnest request? Ah! how I would have liked to remove the envelope from this box in which I had slipped it! If only I could!… When it slipped from my fingers, when I realized that the letter had been sent… already gone… I was ashamed, I turned very red.

Provided that M. Serval is a gentleman!

CHAPTER XXVIII
The postmaster gave me the following letter in the courier this morning:

" Sir,

“It may seem strange to you to receive such unexpected pages, but I have decided to write them to you, seeing no other way to calm my anxiety. I am the wife of your comrade, the quartermaster Maxence, and in his letters my husband speaks to me of you so frequently, in such a friendly manner, with such expansiveness, that I think I am doing the right thing by addressing myself to you, Sir, who show Roger a truly fraternal affection and have been able to tie him to you with ties whose strength I know.

“Now I can't find my words, that I can't express to you what I would like to tell you so much, for lack of a small fact to cling to. When I complain to our friend, Maurice Mahoudiaux (a war-wounded person whom Roger must have told you about), he answers me kindly, with his big laugh: "My dear friend, your husband continues to be what He has always been. The landscape changes, from time to time, that's all. Your anxiety has no common sense. Because it's anguish, sir, a deep and perpetual anguish that tortures me! I can't find my husband anymore! Will I then have lost him forever!“When he lived at home and looked at the little corner of the merchant port, with its masts and its sails, which one sees through the window of the living room, often I felt that his mind was elsewhere, but, I knew how to recall it to me with a few words, a question, a simple gesture, whereas, since he left for the front, his letters have been those of a foreigner! worse than that! they are written for someone other than me!

" Oh ! Sir ! don't think me crazy! I'm just maddened with worry! What's happening to him ? Is he so unhappy, over there in Alsace, that he has forgotten our past happiness? Is he so caught up in this accursed war that he has lost the memory of his wife, of the peace of his home, of so many quiet hours? Yes, I speak to you as I would hardly dare to speak to a twenty-year-old friend, but you will excuse me, you will understand me, won't you? you will know how to tell me the reason for my misery.

“First, I had asked Maurice to write to you in my place, but he didn't want to hear anything and said to me: “My dear friend, if M. Serval is a man who carries his head on his shoulders and not at the end of a pole to enlarge his horizon (I quote his words to you), he will understand nothing of such unfounded complaints; I don't understand much about it myself. Expressed by you or by me, he will see only the imaginations of a worried woman. And then he added that I was "having" neurasthenia! Me, sir! Just think!... I need courage to write to you!

“Oh! if you read Roger's letters! When I have finished them, I cry, and I take them back as soon as my eyes are dry, to reread these dear sentences which cause me so much pain and which I do not recognize as sentences from my husband... and yet, sometimes, a tender word gives it back to me completely! What madness! ah! what madness! and how I suffer!

“No sir, I am not a princess! I do not wear in my hair a long feather of an island bird "heavy at the end" which swings. He writes this to me, sir! And my name isn't… what did he say?… Florimonde, which is a name for an opera girl… And he's not joking there, I assure you! If you read its pages, you might cry yourself!

“Your comrades named my husband: Cigogne, it seems… Why: Cigogne? He says that since then he is a new man and that a new man needs a new woman, and he tells me, sir! things in my life that never existed… as if he was dreaming… as if he was talking about someone else! Yes that's it ! as if he was talking about someone else! Finally, in his last letter (you won't believe it and you're going to say that I'm very badly brought up), in his last letter, he accuses me… how shall I put it… of not having quite excellent health. Indeed, since the month of September 1911, I have never been very well. Is it my fault?

" Oh ! Monsieur Serval! give it to me! give it back to me, I beg of you! Roger is my whole life and if, sometimes, I spent a few rather sad hours with him, when he so passionately wanted what we couldn't have, when he dreamed a thousand follies on his way back from the Café de la Poste or the Grand Coffee, he still knew how to appreciate the little we had and which gave us so much happiness!

"Give me back Roger, Monsieur Serval!" Forgive me for having written you such an unseemly letter, above all do not show it to Roger! let Roger know nothing about it. Answer me.

“Believe, sir, in my sincere gratitude.

Lucienne Maxence .

“  P.S. "And don't forget to tell me why they call my husband Stork." »

Well ! if you think it's funny to receive such a letter!… Besides, you'll have to answer it!… but how?

CHAPTER XXIX
I had opened it at soup time.

" Hey ! Hey ! said Blanc to me, the postman, you still get letters from women! But this writing in purple ink on purple paper, I didn't know it! Oh ! the beautiful little envelope! She smells good! she smells of roses! It's from your good friend, Serval! Blonde or brunette? Will you give me his address? not true ? I'll go and whisper two words in his ear!

“By ear… by ear…” added Renaud, the captain's orderly, always witty.

Charming jokes! and in such a good tone!

I replied in a somewhat hoarse way:

"Instead of scrutinizing the letters from the courier so carefully, you'd better deliver them faster, you bastard!"

"Don't climb the ladder, Serval!" There is no gossip! All the same, this envelope, you...

"Shut up, White!" »

Huyon, who is a brave fellow, said in a low voice to the postmaster:

"Maybe it's his mother or his sister...that's why he takes it badly..."

But Blanc continued:

“Curious that he is so often in a bad mood, our old Serval! He's being mean..."

Then, picking up on a memory:

“I wanted to talk to you, he added, about the little painted portrait you drew of my face, with your pencils. It made the father and the old woman very happy, but, there, absolutely. The family, they tell me to say thank you. We'll put it in a frame. »

And Cigogne, in his corner, while dissecting a piece of monkey, sighed:

“Servel! you get letters from women! When you're single, you can afford that, right?

- But yes !… "Then, without looking like anything, I asked:

"Any news from home?"

"No direct news from Lucienne," he said sullenly, "but from my friend Mahoudiaux, a few badly written lines (he's starting to scribble on his own, all the same), in which he tells me precisely that Lucienne isn't going not very well. She's been nervous for some time, it seems, she's sad. Maurice says she needs moral rest; Above all, he advises me not to disturb him in my letters, to watch myself closely when I write to him. He has some good ones, Maurice! Worry Lucienne! how would i do? Is it by recounting the bourgeois life that we lead here that I could worry Lucienne? Not a cannon shot for forty-eight hours! »

Annoyed, nervous, worried himself, he shrugs his shoulders and leaves.

Ms. Maxence is therefore nervous ! Good God, what am I going to say to him?

CHAPTER XXX
I was coming back from the trench, quite shaken by the intense watering that we had suffered there, and, sitting in Father Dietrich's kitchen, I reread the letter received the day before from Lucienne Maxence. I was trying to bring myself back, to fix my thoughts, bewildered by all the din of the last few hours, when Cigogne suddenly entered. I barely had time to pocket the dangerous purple paper and its envelope.

" Good ! what else happens? »

That something had happened there could be no doubt. Stork's gaze was unsteady, his hands trembling; moreover, he was, unusually, terribly red.

"Come outside," he said, stammering, "I can't talk to you here. »

He took me by the shoulders; he bent over me. His poor crazy eyes hurt to see.

“Imagine! he began, the captain told me...

"Since you can't talk to me here, let's go to the yard." »

We went out. The beginning of the night, fresh and fragrant, evoked a fairyland. A little moonlight, a little breeze, a few still timid stars, the outline, on the road, of a black tree with a silver top, were enough beauty to make a man happy. A nightingale's song would have exceeded the measure.

I whispered in spite of myself:

“Oh! my pal ! how good it is to live! »

And, correcting myself, I added:

“Tell your story. »But I couldn't help listening to the funny little croaking of a frog near the well.

Cigogne was standing beside me, looking right and left, and shaking my arm jerkily, as if he were afraid. Of course, he wasn't listening to the little frog, he couldn't see the moonlight or the tree with the silver hat!

" Lets go ! a bit of peace! I tell him, and tell your story.

"That's a painful confession, Serval!" »

His voice also betrayed deep dread. For some time he struggled with his words; finally :

“My friend, he said, I am a wretch!

- It is understood! ... and then?

'I stayed at Hill 316; the captain came by and said to me: "Maxence, you are going to take this envelope to the colonel." He must be in Altenach right now with his car. No need to come back here; it will send the reply later. And, above all, no recklessness! " I left ; I was following the path that runs along the flooded meadow, it's shorter, you know!… As I skirted the Bois Carré, the bombardment began again… Oh! it was beautiful ! about twenty shells burst in front of me and to my left. I had my head free; I felt happy, peaceful. »

Cigogne was not exaggerating in speaking thus. This good madman never has so much composure as under a watering of shells.

“And I walked quickly, saying to myself: if I can make it—if I'm a little injured, if I can still get there, that's a second citation, maybe the medal! In twenty minutes, I will know… But it was falling! ah! yes, old man, it was falling!… The same thing as at noon! Do you remember?… And now, behind a tree, I see a peasant woman. She seemed to be very scared. She was covered with a cape with a hood. She hid her head in the hood, so as not to see, she was so afraid!…”

He too was very afraid when he told me these things. I felt him shudder and his voice suddenly sounded like little bird cries.

“Then she runs off, because a new shell… She was running, her head down, her hands tight on her hood. I catch up with her and, laughing, I say to her: “Mademoiselle, if you want to walk near me, it will be safer. Shells don't hit me! »

“She snuggled into my greatcoat, like a child, and suddenly I saw that she was indeed a child. She had taken a bad road to go to Altenach; she wasn't sure she had found the right one yet. Lost! she thought she was lost… all that hellish noise! ah! How frightened she was! a child, I tell you! fifteen ! And the shells were still falling… We traveled together; I couldn't let her go alone... and then... and then... You're going to despise me, Serval!

- You can count on it!

'And then I suddenly saw that she was fresh and pretty, and clean for a girl from here, and a crazy idea occurred to me. I wanted to rape her. I held her against me… I walked ever faster, I pulled her along and I imagined, as I walked, that I was knocking her down on the embankment and pulling up her skirts! I heard him crying, I heard him begging me, screaming… I always dragged him away, always faster. Then she said in a low voice: “Oh! I'm out of breath! I would answer: “We have to hurry up! I must get to Altenach! You have to!…” And she laughed, the poor kid! but I could still hear his cries, his insults! She did not want to ! She was struggling!... I almost carried her, while walking. She looked at me with her beautiful blue eyes, so clear; she was laughing, very close to me, tight against me. She was still afraid. She was laughing...

“Finally, I saw the white house on the corner of Altenach. The bombardment had ceased. I let go of the little girl and started running like mad, all alone, forward, and when I handed over to the colonel, I could barely stand on my legs.

'Stork,' I said to him, 'there are buddies who, for having worn a letter in a less dangerous way, have in fact got the medal. »

I didn't want to say anything other than I was saying, I swear! He believed, however, in a sarcastic intention.

“How can you prank me, Serval! I suffered so hard, so deeply, and from a terrible pain, I assure you! Oh!… Rape a child! so think!

- You say that ... And when he returned, what did you do?

“I crouched down in the corner of the yard, like an unhappy monkey, my chin on my knees, and I held my legs; I did not move… Oh! I saw you pass! you entered Father Dietrich's kitchen and, on the threshold, you stopped to throw away your cigarette, then you took a letter from your pocket which you took out of its envelope, then you pushed open the door... Not true ?

- Yes, I replied seriously, it's true.

"And I was always thinking: I raped a little girl!" »He left me, walking slowly.

In the warm, clear night, the frog was still singing, near the well; the tree kept its silver hat; the breeze was almost insensitive. - Surrounded by such a setting, participating in this magical sweetness, surrounded by this peace full of perfumes, this perfect silence, what man would not have dreamed, dreamed the worst madness, dreamed of anything and realized his dreams into a new dream!

Near the well, the frog was croaking, in a deceptively naive tone. In his voice, there was a bit of irony.

CHAPTER XXXI
This morning, I replied to Ms. Maxence. The letter is gone. As I had just dated her, in the lead, I burst out laughing; I was going to write: "My dear Lucienne." I think of this poor woman so often that a little familiarity no doubt seemed natural to me; but I restrained myself.

For lack of being able to do better, I therefore composed this:

" Mrs,

“Far from being surprised by the letter you kindly addressed to me, I was sincerely touched by it and am delighted to give you news of your husband which I hope will alleviate the anxiety from which you seem to be suffering. .

“First of all, Roger's health is excellent. Our dear comrade, who knew so well how to make himself loved by all and whom our officers esteem so highly, has, at the moment, a superb mien. The job, often a little rough, that we exercise and to which he was certainly not accustomed, does not tire him in any way, because I see him, every morning, just as ready for work, regaining his enthusiasm and his ardor of the day before. .

'But it's his morale that you complain about, Madame; I don't see any cause for concern here either. Roger constantly speaks of his home with simple, sometimes very touching emotion. He regrets it, he would like to find him, find you, therefore. He has no dearest desire.

“The peculiarities that troubled you are, it seems to me, due to the simple fact that he lives in a new environment. His entourage, the daily conversations (he is very familiar with his comrades who, as I told you, are very attached to him), the tragic or painful sights that he constantly has before his eyes, must exasperate to the highest degree a sensitivity as fine as his, an imagination as tense.

"As soon as he returns home (his leave will not take long, I think), you will see him as you have always seen him, as your friend Mr. Mahoudiaux told you, and the fears you you were trained in it will fly away.

“Hoping that my letter, hastily written, will help to restore to you the much-needed calm of those who await, with such admirable patience and courage, the return of those who are far away, please accept, Madame, the homage of my very respectful dedication.

“Andre Serval.

“  P.S. — As for the nickname that his comrades gave to Roger, it is explained by the number of storks that we see here, perched on the roofs and whose image many illustrated postcards have reproduced. »

… Oh ! How I would have liked to draw, at the bottom of the sheet, a piece of caricature in which Mme Maxence would have recognized both her husband and the poetic bird whose name he bears! But I held back again.

This letter is gone; I can judge her now. She seems to me silly, devoid of any kind of psychology, useless and even clumsy, because the platitudes that I have uttered about my friend Cigogne will in no way, when read by his wife, "alleviate the anxiety of which she seems suffer”, as it is elegantly written! — they would rather aggravate it! “Well, would you believe it? I had to tear up three drafts before ending up with this poor mess! Literature is not my forte! Certainly Stork would have explained his case better to Lucienne! He would have lied better!

My only excuse is that I don't know that good Lucienne (sorry!)…that I do n't know Mada
