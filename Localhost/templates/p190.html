I — Where fatted calves are killed to celebrate the return of a thrifty child.

On May 18, 1859, Mr. Renault, former professor of physics and chemistry, currently owner in Fontainebleau and member of the municipal council of this pleasant little town, himself sent the following letter to the post office:

“To Monsieur Léon Renault, Civil Engineer, Remaining Office,
Berlin, Prussia.
“My dear child,

“The good news you dated from St. Petersburg has given us the sweetest joy. Your poor mother had been unwell since the winter; I didn't tell you about it for fear of worrying you at this distance. I myself was hardly valiant; there was still a third person (you'll guess his name if you can) who was pining not to see you. But don't worry, my dear Léon: we've been reborn as best as possible since the date of your return has been more or less set. We are beginning to believe that the mines of the Urals will not devour the one who is dearer to us than anything in the world. God be praised! This honorable and rapid fortune will not have cost you your life, or even your health, if it is true that you grew fat in the desert, as you assure us. We won't die without kissing our son! Too bad for you if you haven't finished all your business there: there are three of us who swore that you wouldn't go back there again. Obedience will not be difficult for you, because you will be happy among us. At least that's Clémentine's opinion… I forgot that I had promised myself not to name her! Maître Bonnivet, our excellent neighbour, was not content to place your capital on a good mortgage; he wrote in his spare time a very touching little deed, which is just waiting for your signature. Our worthy mayor has ordered a new scarf for you which has just arrived from Paris. It is you who will have the gift. Your apartment, which will soon be your apartment, is equal to your present fortune. You live… but the house has changed so much over the past three years that my descriptions would be closed to you. It was Mr Audret, the architect of the imperial castle, who directed the work. He absolutely wanted to build me a laboratory worthy of Thénard or Desprez. No matter how much I protested and said that I was no longer good for anything, since my famous memoir on the Condensation of gasesit's still in chapter IV, as your mother was in complicity with that old scoundrel of a friend, it so happens that Science now has a temple with us. A real wizard's shop, following the picturesque expression of your old Gothon. Nothing is missing, not even a four-horsepower steam engine: what shall I do with it? Alas! I fully expect, however, that these expenses will not be lost on everyone. You are not going to rest on your laurels. Ah! if I had had your property when I was your age! I would have devoted my days to pure science, instead of wasting the best part of them with those poor little young people who only took advantage of my class to read Mr. Paul de Kock! I would have been ambitious! I would have liked to attach my name to the discovery of some very general law, or at least to the construction of some very useful instrument. It is too late today; my eyes are tired and the brain itself refuses to work. Your turn, boy! You are not twenty-six, the mines of the Urals have given you enough to live comfortably, you no longer need anything for yourself, the time has come to work for the genre human. It is the deepest desire and the dearest hope of your old good father who loves you and who awaits you with open arms. the time has come to work for mankind. It is the strongest desire and the dearest hope of your old man of a father who loves you and who awaits you with open arms. the time has come to work for mankind. It is the strongest desire and the dearest hope of your old man of a father who loves you and who awaits you with open arms.

“J. RENAULT.
“PS By my calculations, this letter should arrive in Berlin two or three days before you. You will have already learned from the newspapers of the 7th current of the death of the illustrious Monsieur de Humboldt. It is a mourning for science and for humanity. I had the honor of writing to this great man several times in my life, and he condescended to answer me a letter which I keep piously. If you had the opportunity to buy some souvenir of his person, some manuscript of his hand, some fragment of his collections, you would give me real pleasure.

A month after the departure of this letter, the much desired son returned to the paternal house. Mr and Mrs Renault, who came to fetch him from the station, found him grown up, swollen and embellished in every way. To tell the truth, he was not a remarkable boy, but a good and likeable figure. Léon Renault represented an average man, blond, plump and well taken. His large blue eyes, soft voice, and silky beard indicated a nature that was more delicate than powerful. A very white neck, very round and almost feminine, contrasted singularly with his face scorched by the tan. Her teeth were beautiful, very cute, a little indented, not sharp. When he took off his gloves, he discovered two small square hands, quite firm, quite soft, neither hot nor cold, neither dry nor wet,

As he was, his father and his mother would not have exchanged him for the Apollo Belvedere. We kissed him, God knows! overwhelming him with a thousand questions which he forgot to answer. Some old friends from the house, a doctor, an architect, a notary had rushed to the station with the good parents: each of them had his turn, each gave him a hug, each asked him if he was well, if he had had a good trip? He listened patiently and even with joy to this banal melody whose words did not mean much, but whose music went to the heart, because it came from the heart.

We had been there for a good quarter of an hour, and the train had resumed its course, whistling, and the omnibuses from the various hotels had set off one after the other at a brisk trot down the avenue that leads to the town. ; and the June sun never tired of lighting up this happy group of good people. But Madame Renault suddenly exclaimed that the poor child must be starving, and that it was barbaric to delay his dinner hour so long. He protested in vain that he had lunched in Paris and that hunger spoke less loudly than joy: the whole company threw themselves into two large hired carriages, the son beside the mother, the father opposite, as if he could not satisfy his eyes with the sight of this dear son. A cart came behind with the trunks, the large, long, square cases and all the traveller's luggage. At the entrance to the town, the coachmen cracked their whips, the carter followed the example, and this joyous uproar drew the inhabitants to their doors and animated the tranquility of the streets for a moment. Madame Renault cast her eyes to right and left, seeking witnesses to her triumph and greeting with the most cordial friendship people she hardly knew. More than one mother also greeted her, almost without knowing her, for no mother is indifferent to such happiness, and besides, Léon's family was loved by everyone! And the neighbors approached each other saying with a joy free from jealousy: and this joyous uproar drew the inhabitants to their doors and for a moment enlivened the tranquility of the streets.

And the neighbors approached each other saying with a joy free from jealousy:

"It's the Renault son, who worked three years in the Russian mines and who comes to share his fortune with his aged parents!"

Leon also saw a few familiar faces, but not all the ones he wanted to see again. For he leaned for a moment in his mother's ear, saying:

"And Clementine?"

This word was pronounced so low and so close that Mr. Renault himself could not know whether it was a word or a kiss. The good lady smiled tenderly and answered a single word:

— Patience!

As if patience were a very common virtue among lovers!

The door of the house was wide open, and old Gothon on the threshold. She raised her arms to heaven and cried like an animal, because she had known little Leon no higher than that! There was another beautiful embrace on the last step of the steps between the brave servant and her young master. Mr. Renault's friends pretended to withdraw out of discretion, but it was a waste of time: they were shown clearly as day that their table was set. And when everyone was assembled in the living room, except the invisible Clementine, the large armchairs with medallions stretched out their arms towards Mr. Renault's son; the old mirror in the fireplace rejoiced to reflect his image, the big crystal chandelier sounded a little chime, the mandarins on the shelf began to shake their heads in a sign of welcome, as if

Nobody can say why the kisses and the tears started to rain again then, but it is certain that it was like a second arrival.

- Soup! shouted Gothon.

Madame Renault took her son's arm, contrary to all the laws of etiquette, and without even asking pardon of the respectable friends who were there. She barely apologized for serving the child before the guests. Léon let himself be done and he took it well; there was not a guest who would not be able to pour the soup into his waistcoat rather than taste it before him.

'Mother,' cried Leon, spoon in hand, 'this is the first time in three years that I've eaten good soup!

Madame Renault felt herself blushing with pleasure and Gothon broke something; both imagined that the child spoke thus to flatter their self-esteem, and yet he had spoken the truth. There are two things in this world which man does not often find outside his home: good soup is the first; the second is selfless love.

If I undertook here the truthful enumeration of all the dishes which appeared on the table, there would not be one of my readers whose mouth would not water. I even believe that more than one delicate reader would risk getting indigestion. Add, please, that this list would extend to the end of the volume and that I would not have a single page left to write the marvelous story of Fougas. That's why I go back to the living room, where the coffee is already served.

Leon barely took half his cup, but be careful not to conclude that the coffee was too hot or too cold, or too sweet. Nothing in the world would have prevented him from drinking to the last drop, if the knock of the knock on the street door had not resounded even in his heart.

The minute that followed seemed extraordinarily long. No! never in his travels had he encountered a minute as long as this. But at last Clementine appeared, preceded by the worthy Miss Virginie Sambucco, her aunt. And the smiling mandarins on the shelf heard the sound of three kisses.

Why three? The superficial reader who pretends to guess things before they are written has already found a plausible explanation. "Assuredly," he said, "Léon was too respectful to kiss the worthy Miss Sambucco more than once, but when he found himself in the presence of Clementine, who was to be his wife, he doubled the dose and did well." That, sir, is what I call a rash judgment. The first kiss fell from Leon's mouth to Miss Sambucco's cheek; the second was applied by Miss Sambucco's lips to Leon's left cheek; the third was a real accident that plunged two young hearts into deep consternation.

Léon, who was very much in love with his future, rushed towards her blindly, uncertain whether he would kiss her right or left cheek, but determined not to delay any longer a pleasure he had been promising himself since the spring of 1856. Clementine was not thinking of defending herself, but of applying her beautiful red lips to Leon's right cheek, or to the left indifferently. The haste of the two young people caused neither Clementine's cheeks nor those of Leon to receive the offering intended for them. And the mandarins on the shelf, who expected to hear two kisses, only heard one. And Leon was taken aback, Clementine blushed to the ears, and the two fiances took a step back, looking at the rosettes of the carpet, which remained eternally etched in their memory.

Clémentine was, in the eyes of Léon Renault, the prettiest person in the world. He had loved her for a little over three years, and it was partly for her that he had made the trip to Russia. In 1856, she was too young to marry and too rich for an engineer at 2,400 francs to be able to lay claim to her hand. Léon, like a true mathematician, had posed the following problem: "Given a young girl of fifteen and a half, rich in income of 8,000 francs and threatened with Miss Sambucco's inheritance, i.e. 200,000 francs in capital, make a fortune at least equal to hers within a time that allows her to become a big girl without giving her time to become an old girl. He had found the solution in the copper mines of the Urals.

For three long years he had corresponded indirectly with the beloved of his heart. All the letters he wrote to his father or his mother passed through the hands of Mademoiselle Sambucco, who did not hide them from Clementine. Sometimes they were even read aloud, with the family, and Mr. Renault was never obliged to skip a sentence, for Leon wrote nothing that a young girl could not hear. The aunt and niece had no other distractions; they lived in retirement in a little house, at the end of a beautiful garden, and they received only old friends. Clementine therefore had little merit in keeping her heart for Leon. Apart from a tall colonel of cuirassiers who sometimes pursued her out for walks, no man had paid court to her there.

She was very beautiful, however, not only in the eyes of her lover, or of the Renault family, or of the small town in which she lived. The province is inclined to settle for little. She cheaply gives the reputations of a pretty woman and a great man, especially when she is not rich enough to be exacting. It is in the capitals that they claim to admire only absolute merit. I heard a village mayor say, with a certain pride: “Admit that my servant Catherine is very pretty for a commune of six hundred souls!” Clementine was pretty enough to be admired in a town of eight hundred thousand inhabitants. Imagine a little blonde Creole, with black eyes, a dull complexion, and sparkling teeth. Her waist was round and supple like a bulrush. What cute hands she had, and what pretty Andalusian feet, arched, rounded in iron! All his looks were like smiles, and all his movements like caresses. Add that she was neither stupid, nor fearful, nor even ignorant of all things, like little girls brought up in a convent. His education, begun by his mother, had been completed by two or three respectable old professors, chosen by Mr. Renault, his tutor. She had a fair mind and a well-furnished brain. But, in truth, I wonder why I speak of it in the past tense, because it still lives, thank God, and none of its perfections has perished. nor even ignorant of all things, like little girls brought up in a convent.

II — Torchlight unpacking.

Around ten o'clock in the evening, Miss Virginie Sambucco said that they had to think about retirement; these ladies lived with monastic regularity. Leon protested, but Clementine obeyed: it was not without showing a small pout. The drawing-room door was already open and the old lady had put on her hood in the antechamber, when the engineer, suddenly struck with an idea, exclaimed:

"You certainly won't leave without helping me open my trunks!" It is a favor that I ask of you, my good Mademoiselle Sambucco!

The respectable girl stopped; habit urged her to leave; courtesy advised him to stay; an atom of curiosity tipped the balance.

"What happiness!" said Clementine, returning her aunt's hood to the peg.

Madame Renault did not yet know where Leon's luggage had been put. Gothon came to say that everything was thrown pell-mell into the wizard's shop, waiting for Monsieur to designate what to wear in his room. The whole company went with the lamps and torches to a large room on the ground floor where the stoves, the retorts, the physics instruments, the boxes, the trunks, the sleeping bags, the hatboxes and the famous steam engine formed a confused and charming sight. The light was played in this interior as in certain paintings of the Dutch school. It slipped on the big yellow cylinders of the electric machine, bounced off the thin glass matrass, collided with two silver reflectors and snagged a magnificent Fortin barometer as it passed.

Leon, armed with a bunch of small keys, opened the trunks one after the other. Clementine was seated opposite him on a large oblong box, and she looked at him with all her eyes, more affection than curiosity. They began by setting aside two enormous square boxes which contained only mineralogy samples, after which they passed the review of the riches of all kinds which the engineer had kept in his linen and his clothes.

A sweet smell of Russian leather, caravan tea, tobacco from the Levant and essence of roses soon spread through the workshop. Léon brought back a little of everything, following the custom of wealthy travelers who have left behind them a family and many friends: He exhibited in turn Asian fabrics, embossed silver hookahs that come from Persia, boxes of tea, rose sorbets, precious essences, gold fabrics from Tarjok, ancient weapons, a niello silverware service from the Tula factory, Russian-style jewels, bracelets from the Caucasus, necklaces of milky amber and a leather bag filled with turquoise, such as are sold at the Nizhny Novgorod fair. Each object passed from hand to hand, amid questions, explanations and interjections of all kinds. All the friends who were there received the presents which were intended for them. It was a concert of polite refusals, friendly insistences and thanks in all tones. Needless to say, the biggest share went to Clementine; but she didn't need to be asked, because, at the point where we were, all these beautiful things went into the basket and did not leave the family.

Léon brought back to his father an excessively beautiful dressing gown, in cloth brocaded with gold, a few old books found in Moscow, a pretty painting by Greuze, lost by chance in an ignoble shop in the Gastinitvor , two magnificent samples of rock crystal and a cane from Mr de Humboldt:

'You see,' he said to Mr. Renault, putting this historic ring in his hands, 'the postscript to your last letter didn't fall into the water.

The old professor received this present with visible emotion.

'I'll never use it,' he said to his son. 'The Napoleon of science has held it in his hand. What would people think if an old sergeant like me allowed himself to wear it on his walks in the forest? And the collections? Couldn't buy anything? Did they sell well?

"We didn't sell them," replied Leon. Everything went into the National Museum in Berlin. But in my eagerness to please you, I got robbed in a strange way. The very day of my arrival, I expressed your desire to the house servant who accompanied me. He swore to me that a small Jewish second-hand dealer friend of his, named Ritter, was trying to sell a very fine anatomical piece from the estate. I ran to the Jew, examined the mummy, for it was one, and paid without haggling the price they wanted. But the next day, a friend of Mr. de Humboldt, Professor Hirtz, told me the story of this human rag, which had been lying around in the store for more than ten years, and which never belonged to Mr. de Humboldt. Where the hell did Gothon stuff it? Ah!

Clementine wanted to get up, but Leon made her sit down.

'We have plenty of time,' he said, 'to look at this old stuff, and besides, you guess it's not a pleasant sight. Here is the story Father Hirtz told me; moreover, he has promised to send me a copy of a rather curious memoir on this subject. Don't go yet, my good Miss Sambucco! It's a little military and scientific novel. We'll look at the mummy when I let you know of its misfortunes.

— Parbleu! exclaimed Mr. Audret, the architect of the castle, it is the novel of the mummy that you are going to recite to us. Too late, my poor Léon: Théophile Gautier took the lead in the series of the Moniteur , and everyone knows your Egyptian story!

— My story, said Leon, is no more Egyptian than Manon Lescaut . Our good Doctor Martout, here present, must know the name of Professor Jean Meiser of Danzig; he lived at the beginning of our century, and I believe that his last works are from 1824 or 1825.

"From 1823," replied Mr. Martout. Meiser is one of the scholars who have done Germany the greatest honor. In the midst of the terrible wars that bloodied his country, he continued the work of Leeuwenkoeck, Baker, Needham, Fontana, and Spallanzani on reviving animals. Our school honors in him one of the fathers of modern biology.

- God! Bad big words! cried Miss Sambucco. Is it permissible to detain people at such an hour to make them listen to German!

Clementine tried to calm her down.

'Don't listen to big words, my dear little aunt; spare yourself for the novel, since there is one!

"A terrible one," said Leon. Miss Clementine is seated on a human victim, immolated to science by Professor Meiser.

For once, Clementine got up, and quickly, her fiancé offered her a chair and sat down himself in the place she had just left. The listeners, fearing that Leon's novel was in several volumes, took up position around him, some in a trunk, some in an armchair.

III — The crime of the learned Professor Meiser.

'Ladies,' said Leon, 'Professor Meiser was not a common malefactor, but a man devoted to science and to humanity. If he killed the French colonel who is now lying under the coattails of my frock coat, it was first to save his life, then to clear up a question which interests you yourselves to the highest point.

“The duration of our existence is infinitely too short. This is a fact that no man can dispute. To think that in a hundred years none of the nine or ten people who are gathered in this house will no longer live on the surface of the earth! Isn't that a heartbreaking thing?

Miss Sambucco heaved a heavy sigh. Leon continued:

"Alas! mademoiselle, I have often sighed like you, at the thought of this sad necessity. You have a niece, the prettiest and loveliest of all nieces, and the sight of her charming face gladdens your heart. But you desire something more; you won't be satisfied until you see your grand-nephews running. You will see them, I count on it. But will you see their children? it is doubtful. Their grandchildren? It's impossible. As for the tenth, twentieth, thirtieth generation, we must not think about it.

“We think about it, however, and there is perhaps not a man who has not said to himself at least once in his life: “If only I could be reborn in two hundred years!” This one would like to return to earth to seek news of his family, that one of his dynasty. A philosopher is curious to know if the ideas he has sown will have borne fruit; a politician if his party has gained the upper hand; a miser, if his heirs have not dissipated the fortune he has made; a simple owner, if the trees of his garden will have grown. No one is indifferent to the future destinies of this world that we gallop through in the space of a few years and never to return. How many people have envied the fate of Epimenides, who fell asleep in a cave and saw when he opened his eyes that the world had aged! Who hasn't dreamed up the marvelous adventure of Sleeping Beauty on their own?

"Well! ladies, Professor Meiser, one of the most serious men of our century, was convinced that science can put a living being to sleep and wake it up after an infinite number of years, stop all the functions of the body, suspend life , to hide an individual from the action of time for a century or two, and to resuscitate him afterwards.

"So he was a madman?" exclaimed Madame Renault.

'I wouldn't swear to it. But he had ideas of his own about the great spring which moves living beings. Do you remember, dear mother, the first impression you had as a little girl, when you were shown the inside of a moving watch? You were convinced that there was in the middle of the box a very fidgety little beast that struggled twenty-four hours a day to turn the hands. If the needles no longer worked, you said: "It's because the little beast is dead." Maybe she was just asleep.

“You have since been told that the watch contained a set of well-adapted and well-oiled organs which moved spontaneously in perfect harmony. If a spring breaks, if a cog is broken, if a grain of sand is introduced between two parts, the watch no longer works, and the children exclaim with good reason: "The little beast is dead." But assuming a solid watch, well established, healthy in every way, and stopped because the organs no longer slip for lack of oil, the little beast is not dead: it only takes a little oil to wake it up .
