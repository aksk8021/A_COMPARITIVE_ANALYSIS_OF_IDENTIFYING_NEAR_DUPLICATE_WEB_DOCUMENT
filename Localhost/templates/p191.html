On January 24, 185, what is called all of Paris pushed, crushed and tumbled at the ball of these people.

The Hôtel des Gautripon, which received visitors every Wednesday, was cited as one of the largest and most sumptuous on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées. The steward and the first groom shared twenty louis a week, just to show off the stables and the mangers of white marble. We read in the Foreigner's Guide that on such a day, at such a time, the English could see the picture gallery, and in particular the incomparable Passion of Albert Dürer. Madame Gautripon went to the races in a gala carriage, like a queen; she bought the horses that the Empress had found too expensive. His emeralds had enjoyed a European reputation since the London exhibition, where Webster and Samson had displayed them in a separate display case,. The train of this bourgeois house represented a low price of one hundred thousand francs a month. A single detail will allow you to measure the prodigality of Gautriponne: the children each had their service and their crews; now the eldest walked on seven years and the youngest was eighteen months old.

The world witnessed these magnificences, and the Parisian world, which knows everything, knew that Gautripon (Jean-Pierre) had not inherited a penny. His childhood companions were not dead; he had been seen as a scholarship holder at the Mathey boarding school, then a study teacher in a threadbare hat, gaping boots, then an expeditionary at eighteen hundred francs. Madame Gautripon, née Pigat, was a pupil at Saint-Denis, the daughter of an old infantry captain. His father, an honest Breton from Morlaix, had left the reputation of an ancient uprightness and brutality: in his old regiment, the 62nd , they still say: "stiff as Pigat. " But, as he had taken no Summer Palace, this virtuous savage had been able to give his daughter only the regulation dowry brought twenty years earlier by his wife,

The splendors of this house were therefore an enigma proposed to the sagacity of Paris. No one had heard that an uncle from America had bequeathed his dollars to the former study master or to the beautiful Emilie, his wife. A few habitues of the house, to clear their conscience and to scrape off the bread they were eating, would say: “Gautripon has a genius for business, he speculates, everything succeeds for him; but no stockbroker had bought or sold three francs a year on Gautripon's behalf.

On the other hand, it was well known that the house had a rich and generous commensal like a king. He was called Léon Bréchot; he had inherited all the millions from his father, Nicolas Bréchot, navvy, then foreman, then contractor, and lastly supplier to all the great companies of Europe. This almost illiterate Auvergnat, but calculating in the first place and endowed with an infallible eye, delivered railways and canals to you on request, like a shoemaker delivers a pair of boots: simple, round, honest in business, comrade to his workmen even to beat them, and harder at work than the best of them. Labour, which has been the only irremovable king for some time, can alone build royal fortunes. When Father Bréchot, big eater like all those who spend their strength without counting, took his final indigestion, his assets were estimated at more than fifty millions. The fact is that no one, not even him, could have compiled an inventory of them. This fat conqueror of millions was, like Alexander, Charlemagne and Bonaparte, better organized to take than to keep what he had taken. His enormous winnings had been lodged haphazardly; there was everything in the estate: bullion piled up at the Bank, blue chip stocks in the portfolio with a lot of shady stocks; mortgage investments, five or six houses in Paris, a farm in Sologne, a mercury mine in Spain, a marble quarry in Algeria, a forest of ten square leagues in Russia, a famous vintage in the Médoc, a factory of matches in Baden, sponsorship shares in Saint-Étienne and many acknowledgments subscribed on paper by candlelight by small borrowers with poor credit. The panorama of these riches, suddenly displayed before the eyes of a twenty-five-year-old heir, must have dazzled him like a new treasure from Monte Cristo, for he had come from a strict education. Until the age of eighteen, his father had kept him locked away in a famous boarding house, with the invincible Mathey, terror of the general competition. A mediocre student and a bachelor God knows how, he left the boarding school for his father's offices, and for a long time did the work of a clerk at eighteen hundred francs. It is true that his father lodged him, clothed him, lent him horses, and paid him a hundred louis a month for his gloves and cigars; but this surly father only paid outside the justified expenses; he forbade gambling, he jumped at the idea that Leon might sign a bill of exchange, and said with a frown on his big eyebrows: "Make sure you discount my death, and I'll disinherit you for the benefit of my workmen!" These incredible rigors in a time as lax as ours had kindled in the adolescent a thirst for expenditure and an impatience to enjoy which did not even wait for the end of the great mourning. He approached life as a man who does not know the amount of his fortune. His playmates and rivals in sport immediately gave him a nickname reminiscent of his father's industry: he was called the entrepreneur of his ruin. He knew it, and one day said rather pleasantly: “Impossible! My father was stronger in his way than I was in mine. » he jumped at the idea that Leon might sign a bill of exchange, and said, knitting his big eyebrows: "Make sure you discount my death, and I'll disinherit you for the benefit of my workmen!"

This madman was no fool; there was no shortage of repartee. To a certain apprentice journalist who too soon boasted of being the son of his works, he replied: “Excuse me, my dear; your works are very young to already have grown-up children. His wit, his belated childishness, and above all his prodigality found favor with the world of raftsmen, into which he threw himself headlong. Paris forgave him his millions on the tacit condition that he would not keep them for long. He was only to be the usufructuary of his fortune; they ranked him with confidence among the decavated of the future. This reputation was founded so quickly and so well that not a mother made the gesture of offering her daughter to him. As for those who specialize in offering themselves, they hovered around him for some time, and the left to his happy fate as soon as it was proven that his heart was not available. It was known or thought to be known that Bréchot was monopolized by a bourgeois family and that he lived as a third party in the Gautripon household. The fact seemed all the more probable since the train of the Gautripons was growing visibly. The former cashier of Bréchot senior, a rich and respected man, said that M. Léon had wanted to marry a grisette, but that the boss had gotten in the way. It was rumored that the eldest son of the beautiful Emilie had come prematurely; but the proof was wanting, Madame Gautripon having had her first childbirth in Italy. Another legend had it that Captain Pigat had died by his own hand, to survive the family honor as little as possible.

To these ill-demonstrated imputations, which were held up in the air by the force of their probability, the friends of the house replied: “Bréchot and Gautripon got together early; they were inseparable at the Mathey boarding house. Gautripon Junior, when he lost his father, had his friend's father as his correspondent. Léon Bréchot, a year and more after leaving college, came to see Gautripon at Mathey's and tell him about his love affairs. Jean-Pierre wrote for him well-turned and above all correct verses, of which the other did himself honor in a certain world. Is it therefore astonishing that the son of a family, in taking possession of his fortune, should have thought of so old and so dear a comrade? You see him throwing the millions out the window, and you ask him to shout to Gautripon all alone: ​​Beware below! When a house burns down, the neighbors are hotter than the others, and no one accuses them of stealing that heat. We do not claim that Gautripon speculates with the money of his patrimony; he borrows to gamble, but what he earns is his. »

This defense system was the only one possible. How to liken Madame Gautripon to those poor lionesses who count two hundred francs a thousand crowns cashmere? There isn't a Jean-Pierre in the world so naive as to believe that twelve horses are fed on an income of twelve hundred francs. However, the community had no other demonstrated income, and the gentleman was not known to have any other means of existence, except his occupation as a husband.It was therefore shown on the finger; he carried on his shoulders a load of contempt which would have crushed fifty elephants. The vulgar gladly laugh at a husband deceived by his wife, kind-hearted people who reason a little take pity on him; but on the base complacent who sells his share of happiness and dignity there is only one opinion: everyone agrees in rating him with infamy. After seven years of marriage, Gautripon was no longer called Jean-Pierre; he was for all Paris the infamous Gautripon.

When he made a purchase for Madame and gave his name and address, the store cashier raised his head, the clerk who had accompanied him to the counter looked him in the face, incoming or outgoing buyers turned around , and everyone seemed to say: “Ah! ha! this is how it is done! His servants, better paid than office managers, served him out of grace, and God knows in what terms they spoke of him in the office! One day his wife buys a pair of horses. The stable boy who had brought them leaves with a tip of two louis. A groom of the house runs after him, stops him and says to him:

"Hope you're paying for lunch?"

- On what? out of forty unfortunate francs?

"We only gave you that?"

- My word!

- Who?

- Sir.

- Ah! you will tell me so much! Madame must have given five louis, but the villain will have put three in his pocket. »

This detail says more in its brutality than anything one could write.

The facade was of white stone, polished like marble. Almost every morning the waiter's maid washed the word "infamous" in it with sweeping strokes of the sponge, drawn in charcoal by the virtuous rascals of the neighborhood.

From the point of view of absolute morality, the trinity of this household was uniformly criminal. The husband who sells, the lover who buys, and the wife who gives herself up like an inert commodity, all deserve to be shrouded in the same disgust; but morality and opinion are two.

Public opinion smiled on Bréchot as on all victors; she would have been touched for nothing by Emilie's unfortunate fate; she crushed Gautripon alone. Bréchot was a happy fellow, nothing else, a man who had chosen his mistress well and who was proud of his money. Emilie, sacrificed by an unworthy husband, seemed almost as interesting as Joseph sold by his brothers. For Gautripon, honest people were indignant that the Penal Code did not contain a single article addressed to that rascal.

If only he had practiced those ways which disarm the rigor of the world! There are a thousand accommodations with the Puritanism of Paris. Many things are passed to scoundrels who know how to live. The obliging swindlers, the polite counterfeiters obtain in the long run a kind of charitable rehabilitation: virtue itself ends up giving them a helping hand, weary of the fight, even if it means having to wash afterwards; but Gautripon had never found a thousand francs in his pocket to assist an unfortunate person. As much as Madame was prodigal, so tenacious was he to keep his ignoble salary. When a former companion in distress went to ring his doorbell, Monsieur was not there. Those who wrote to him asking for some financial service obtained a pitiful refusal, enveloped in long stringy sentences. His attitude in the world does was nothing short of pleasant. He spoke little, answered in monosyllables, looked on with a cold air, and seemed to be on his guard against an affront still suspended. "Poor M. Gautripon!" said the Countess Mahler one evening, one would think he was walking down an avenue of bellows. »

If he attended his wife's balls, it was with such marked indifference that several guests, at first, thought they were badly received. He greeted people with a constrained smile, then disappeared into the darkest corner until the noise of the party and the distraction of the public allowed him to escape incognito. This strange way of receiving ends up finding grace; they overlooked the sad originality of the infamous. They no longer greeted him except for the sake of conscience, and among the young people who danced the cotillion in his hotel, some boasted of not having been introduced to him. Players knew him even less, because he never touched a card; he did not even go up to the gallery on the first floor, where the gaming tables were set up. lansquenet and rubicon came there as in the circle. Léon Bréchot did not fail to invite his acquaintances from the club and the foyer of the Opera without ceremony. Those who had come to the house three times were not afraid to bring others. In the midst of this anarchy and this prodigality, everyone, except Gautripon, was at home. When he gave dinner, the guests were chosen with a little more discernment, but by Madame or by Bréchot. They were all introduced to the husband, but he had so little memory or politeness that he didn't recognize them the next day in the street. In the midst of the most sumptuous and exquisite meals, he seemed ashamed of his appetite: he barely swallowed a soup and a few mouthfuls of meat; but he broke and furtively nibbled his bread with a mechanical movement which only ceased at dessert. He drank his pure water.

Perhaps also the wines of this famous winery seemed tasteless to a former blue wine drinker. The former master of studies at the Mathey pension could hardly appreciate the masterpieces of the great Coulard, that prodigy of science stolen from the Prince of Metternich by the diplomacy of Bréchot. Some moralists insinuated that the base tastes contracted from youth never get out of the slum: Gautripon was accused of indulging in secret orgies of double fat and onion soup. This hypothesis was confirmed by testimony as curious as it was unexpected. The footman of the Peruvian general Don Pablo Puchinete swore that he knew M. Gautripon for having lunched with him ten times in a brothof coachmen, rue de la Vieille-Estrapade. The thing was a little too strong to obtain credence among people who reason; there remained, however, an indescribable odor of villainy around the accused. The simplicity of his tastes, the dilapidated state of his clothes, always threadbare and always clean, the coarse linen of his handkerchiefs, the modest percale of his shirt, all those habits of saving and personal outrageous of his house, were so many charges against him. It was decided that this man was ignoble in everything, and the world no longer saw him except through a detestable opinion.

To those who might have thought otherwise, his person was neither ugly nor repulsive. He was a tall boy of thirty-two, slender and well-built, but a little bent forward under the weight of his infamy. The features of the face were firm, the nose a little large, but elegant and proud in shape, the mouth small, the teeth beautiful, the forehead high and the eyebrows nobly drawn. He shaved his beard neatly and wore his hair close-cropped. Her hair of the finest black was visibly silvering at her temples, and this ray of anticipated old age softened her whole face. The wretch, whose hand was only given out of pity, himself had a nervous, dry, warm hand, one of those hands which attract you, hold you back, and which would seize your friendship, if the 'we don't

The friend of the house, this Léon Bréchot whom you know, was an admirable type of happy man. Neither too tall nor too short, neither fat nor thin, neither dark nor blond, neither handsome nor ugly, he cited himself as the best balanced of all mortals. Good humor and health radiated from her round, colorful face; his gray eyes twinkled; his short nose, wide open and slightly upturned, inhaled with joyful avidity the perfume of good things. The multicolored beard, blonde at the roots, red in the middle, brown at the end, fanned out to complete this blooming face. An imperceptibly Olympian hairstyle lifted her chestnut hair from forehead to occiput in two quivering masses. A solid drinker and a fine eater, he had taken just enough overweight to give a harmonious curvature to its cambric breastplates, under the superbly open waistcoat. A Lavater would have read in his countenance frankness, benevolence, generosity, contempt for wealth, ignorance of danger, ardor of passions: what was somewhat lacking was perseverance, devotion, seriousness. , the solid, the force of will and the faculty of suffering; And so what? Do birds need fins? Does the beloved, rich, happy man have to do with this fierce energy which struggles hand to hand with misfortune? was perseverance, devotion, seriousness, solidity, the strength of will and the faculty of suffering; And so what? Do birds need fins? Does the beloved, rich, happy man have to do with this fierce energy which struggles hand to hand with misfortune? was perseverance, devotion, seriousness, solidity, the strength of will and the faculty of suffering; And so what? Do birds need fins? Does the beloved, rich, happy man have to do with this fierce energy which struggles hand to hand with misfortune?

The woman who shared herself (it was said) between these two gentlemen cannot be compared to any other, nor even to any living creature; but one would realize its truly special beauty if one had the patience to carefully study a doll of great price. The dolls represent neither women nor children, but an intermediate age: this was the case with Madame Gautripon, although she was the mother of two boys and a girl. Her hair, finer than silk and almost white blond, reminded us of the lamb's fleece on Huret dolls. However, the body did not have the stiffness and dryness of hardened gutta-percha: the hands, the arms, the shoulders, everything one sees at the ball was of a uniform, absolute whiteness, like the bodies of skin dolls. Black eyes, of a sparkling enamel, illuminated round lines, soft, slightly melted, and softly colored like wax. The mouth was too small, the eyes too large, the feet and hands almost invisible, in keeping with the professional aesthetics of knick-knacks. His toilets were costumes as rich and as bizarre as those that Marcelin, the admirable
