We all dream of great deeds and high positions, away from the pettiness and humdrum of ordinary life. Yet success is not occupying a lofty place or doing conspicuous work; it is being the best that is in you. Rattling around in too big a job is much worse than filling a small one to overflowing. Dream, aspire by all means; but do not ruin the life you must lead by dreaming pipe-dreams of the one you would like to lead. Make the most of what you have and are. Perhaps your trivial, immediate task is your one sure way of proving your mettle. Do the thing near at hand, and great things will come to your hand to be done.

  If you can't be a pine on the top of the hill
    Be a scrub in the valley—but be
  The best little scrub by the side of the rill;
    Be a bush if you can't be a tree.
  If you can't be a bush be a bit of the grass,
    And some highway some happier make;
  If you can't be a muskie then just be a bass—
    But the liveliest bass in the lake!
  We can't all be captains, we've got to be crew,
    There's something for all of us here.
  There's big work to do and there's lesser to do,
    And the task we must do is the near.
  If you can't be a highway then just be a trail,
    If you can't be the sun be a star;
  It isn't by size that you win or you fail—
    Be the best of whatever you are!
Douglas Malloch.

THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
This poem has as its keynote friendship and sympathy for other people. It is a paradox of life that by hoarding love and happiness we lose them, and that only by giving them away can we keep them for ourselves. The more we share, the more we possess. We of course find in other people weaknesses and sins, but our best means of curing these are through a wise and sympathetic understanding.

  Let me live in a house by the side of the road,
    Where the race of men go by—
  The men who are good and the men who are bad,
    As good and as bad as I.
  I would not sit in the scorner's seat,
    Or hurl the cynic's ban;—
  Let me live in a house by the side of the road
    And be a friend to man.
  I see from my house by the side of the road,
    By the side of the highway of life,
  The men who press with the ardor of hope,
    The men who are faint with the strife.
  But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears—
    Both parts of an infinite plan;—
  Let me live in my house by the side of the road
    And be a friend to man.
  I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead
    And mountains of wearisome height;
  And the road passes on through the long afternoon
    And stretches away to the night.
  But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,
    And weep with the strangers that moan,
  Nor live in my house by the side of the road
    Like a man who dwells alone.
  Let me live in my house by the side of the road
    Where the race of men go by—
  They are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong,
    Wise, foolish—so am I.
  Then why should I sit in the scorner's seat
    Or hurl the cynic's ban?—
  Let me live in my house by the side of the road
    And be a friend to man.
Sam Walter Foss.

From "Dreams in Homespun."

FOUR THINGS
What are the qualities of ideal manhood? Various people have given various answers to this question. Here the poet states what qualities he thinks indispensable.

  Four things a man must learn to do
  If he would make his record true:
  To think without confusion clearly;
  To love his fellow-men sincerely;
  To act from honest motives purely;
  To trust in God and Heaven securely.
Henry Van Dyke.

From "Collected Poems."

IF
The central idea of this poem is that success comes from self-control and a true sense of the values of things. In extremes lies danger. A man must not lose heart because of doubts or opposition, yet he must do his best to see the grounds for both. He must not be deceived into thinking either triumph or disaster final; he must use each wisely—and push on. In all things he must hold to the golden mean. If he does, he will own the world, and even better, for his personal reward he will attain the full stature of manhood.

  If you can keep your head when all about you
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;
  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
  Or being hated don't give way to hating,
    And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
  If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,
  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two imposters just the same;
  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:
  If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
  And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,
  And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them; "Hold on!"
  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
  If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
  Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
    And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!
Rudyard Kipling.

From "Rudyard Kipling's Verse, 1885-1918."

INVICTUS
Triumph in spirit over adverse conditions is the keynote of this poem of courage undismayed. It rings with the power of the individual to guide his own destiny.

  Out of the night that covers me,
    Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
  I thank whatever gods may be
    For my unconquerable soul.
  In the fell clutch of circumstance
    I have not winced nor cried aloud.
  Under the bludgeonings of chance
    My head is bloody, but unbowed.
  Beyond this place of wrath and tears
    Looms but the Horror of the shade,
  And yet the menace of the years
    Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.
  It matters not how strait the gate,
    How charged with punishments the scroll,
  I am the master of my fate:
    I am the captain of my soul.
William Ernest Henley.

IT COULDN'T BE DONE
After a thing has been done, everybody is ready to declare it easy. But before it has been done, it is called impossible. One reason why people fear to embark upon great enterprises is that they see all the difficulties at once. They know they could succeed in the initial tasks, but they shrink from what is to follow. Yet "a thing begun is half done." Moreover the surmounting of the first barrier gives strength and ingenuity for the harder ones beyond. Mountains viewed from a distance seem to be unscalable. But they can be climbed, and the way to begin is to take the first upward step. From that moment the mountains are less high. As Hannibal led his army across the foothills, then among the upper ranges, and finally over the loftiest peaks and passes of the Alps, or as Peary pushed farther and farther into the solitudes that encompass the North Pole, so can you achieve any purpose whatsoever if you heed not the doubters, meet each problem as it arises, and keep ever with you the assurance It Can Be Done.

  Somebody said that it couldn't be done,
    But he with a chuckle replied
  That "maybe it couldn't," but he would be one
    Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.
  So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin
    On his face. If he worried he hid it.
  He started to sing as he tackled the thing
    That couldn't be done, and he did it.
  Somebody scoffed: "Oh, you'll never do that;
    At least no one ever has done it";
  But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,
    And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.
  With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,
    Without any doubting or quiddit,
  He started to sing as he tackled the thing
    That couldn't be done, and he did it.
  There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,
    There are thousands to prophesy failure;
  There are thousands to point out to you one by one,
    The dangers that wait to assail you.
  But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,
    Just take off your coat and go to it;
  Just start to sing as you tackle the thing
    That "cannot be done," and you'll do it.
Edgar A. Guest.

From "The Path to Home."

THE WELCOME MAN
There's a man in the world who is never turned down, wherever he chances to stray; he gets the glad hand in the populous town, or out where the farmers make hay; he's greeted with pleasure on deserts of sand, and deep in the aisles of the woods; wherever he goes there's the welcoming hand—he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods. The failures of life sit around and complain; the gods haven't treated them white; they've lost their umbrellas whenever there's rain, and they haven't their lanterns at night; men tire of the failures who fill with their sighs the air of their own neighborhoods; there's one who is greeted with love-lighted eyes—he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods. One fellow is lazy, and watches the clock, and waits for the whistle to blow; and one has a hammer, with which he will knock, and one tells a story of woe; and one, if requested to travel a mile, will measure the perches and roods; but one does his stunt with a whistle or smile—he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods. One man is afraid that he'll labor too hard—the world isn't yearning for such; and one man is always alert, on his guard, lest he put in a minute too much; and one has a grouch or a temper that's bad, and one is a creature of moods; so it's hey for the joyous and rollicking lad—for the One Who Delivers the Goods!

Walt Mason.

From "Walt Mason, His Book."

THE QUITTER
In the famous naval duel between the Bonhomme Richard and the Serapis, John Paul Jones was hailed by his adversary to know whether he struck his colors. "I have not yet begun to fight," was his answer. When the surrender took place, it was not Jones's ship that became the prize of war. Everybody admires a hard fighter—the man who takes buffets standing up, and in a spirit of "Never say die" is always ready for more.

  When you're lost in the wild and you're scared as a child,
    And death looks you bang in the eye;
  And you're sore as a boil, it's according to Hoyle
    To cock your revolver and die.
  But the code of a man says fight all you can,
    And self-dissolution is barred;
  In hunger and woe, oh it's easy to blow—
    It's the hell served for breakfast that's hard.
  You're sick of the game? Well now, that's a shame!
    You're young and you're brave and you're bright.
  You've had a raw deal, I know, but don't squeal.
    Buck up, do your damnedest and fight!
  It's the plugging away that will win you the day,
    So don't be a piker, old pard;
  Just draw on your grit; it's so easy to quit—
    It's the keeping your chin up that's hard.
  It's easy to cry that you're beaten and die,
    It's easy to crawfish and crawl,
  But to fight and to fight when hope's out of sight,
    Why, that's the best game of them all.
  And though you come out of each grueling bout,
    All broken and beaten and scarred—
  Just have one more try. It's dead easy to die,
    It's the keeping on living that's hard.
Robert W. Service.

FRIENDS OF MINE
We like to be hospitable. To what should we be more hospitable than a glad spirit or a kind impulse?

  Good-morning, Brother Sunshine,
    Good-morning, Sister Song,
  I beg your humble pardon
    If you've waited very long.
  I thought I heard you rapping,
    To shut you out were sin,
  My heart is standing open,
    Won't you
      walk
        right
          in?
  Good-morning, Brother Gladness,
    Good-morning, Sister Smile,
  They told me you were coming,
    So I waited on a while.
  I'm lonesome here without you,
    A weary while it's been,
  My heart is standing open,
    Won't you
      walk
        right
          in?
  Good-morning, Brother Kindness,
    Good-morning, Sister Cheer,
  I heard you were out calling,
    So I waited for you here.
  Some way, I keep forgetting
    I have to toil or spin
  When you are my companions,
    Won't you
      walk
        right
          in?
James W. Foley.

From "The Voices of Song."

THE WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS
"Is this the little woman that made this great war?" was Lincoln's greeting to Harriet Beecher Stowe. Often a woman is responsible for events by whose crash and splendor she herself is obscured. Often too she shapes the career of husband or brother or son. A man succeeds and reaps the honors of public applause, when in truth a quiet little woman has made it all possible—has by her tact and encouragement held him to his best, has had faith in him when his own faith has languished, has cheered him with the unfailing assurance, "You can, you must, you will."

Somewhere she waits to make you win, your soul in her firm, white hands— Somewhere the gods have made for you, the Woman Who Understands!

  As the tide went out she found him
    Lashed to a spar of Despair,
  The wreck of his Ship around him—
    The wreck of his Dreams in the air;
  Found him and loved him and gathered
    The soul of him close to her heart—
  The soul that had sailed an uncharted sea,
  The soul that had sought to win and be free—
    The soul of which she was part!
      And there in the dusk she cried to the man,
      "Win your battle—you can, you can!"
  Broken by Fate, unrelenting,
    Scarred by the lashings of Chance;
  Bitter his heart—unrepenting—
    Hardened by Circumstance;
  Shadowed by Failure ever,
    Cursing, he would have died,
  But the touch of her hand, her strong warm hand,
  And her love of his soul, took full command,
    Just at the turn of the tide!
      Standing beside him, filled with trust,
      "Win!" she whispered, "you must, you must!"
  Helping and loving and guiding,
    Urging when that were best,
  Holding her fears in hiding
    Deep in her quiet breast;
  This is the woman who kept him
    True to his standards lost,
  When, tossed in the storm and stress of strife,
  He thought himself through with the game of life
    And ready to pay the cost.
      Watching and guarding, whispering still,
      "Win you can—and you will, you will!"
  This is the story of ages,
    This is the Woman's way;
  Wiser than seers or sages,
    Lifting us day by day;
  Facing all things with a courage
    Nothing can daunt or dim,
  Treading Life's path, wherever it leads—
  Lined with flowers or choked with weeds,
    But ever with him—with him!
      Guidon—comrade—golden spur—
      The men who win are helped by her!
Somewhere she waits, strong in belief, your soul in her firm, white hands: Thank well the gods, when she comes to you—the Woman Who Understands!

Everard Jack Appleton.

From "The Quiet Courage."

WANTED—A MAN
Business and the world are exacting in their demands upon us. They make no concessions to half-heartedness, incompetence, or plodding mediocrity. But for the man who has proved his worth and can do the exceptional things with originality and sound judgment, they are eagerly watchful and have rich rewards.

    You say big corporations scheme
  To keep a fellow down;
  They drive him, shame him, starve him too
  If he so much as frown.
  God knows I hold no brief for them;
  Still, come with me to-day
  And watch those fat directors meet,
  For this is what they say:
        "In all our force not one to take
      The new work that we plan!
      In all the thousand men we've hired
      Where shall we find a man?"
    The world is shabby in the way
  It treats a fellow too;
  It just endures him while he works,
  And kicks him when he's through.
  It's ruthless, yes; let him make good,
  Or else it grabs its broom
  And grumbles: "What a clutter's here!
  We can't have this. Make room!"
        And out he goes. It says, "Can bread
      Be made from mouldy bran?
      The men come swarming here in droves,
      But where'll I find a man?"
    Yes, life is hard. But all the same
  It seeks the man who's best.
  Its grudging makes the prizes big;
  The obstacle's a test.
  Don't ask to find the pathway smooth,
  To march to fife and drum;
  The plum-tree will not come to you;
  Jack Horner, hunt the plum.
        The eyes of life are yearning, sad,
      As humankind they scan.
      She says, "Oh, there are men enough,
      But where'll I find a man?"
St. Clair Adams.

IF I SHOULD DIE
A man whose word is as good as his bond is a man the world admires. It is related of Fox that a tradesman whom he long had owed money found him one day counting gold and asked for payment. Fox replied: "No; I owe this money to Sheridan. It is a debt of honor. If an accident should happen to me, he has nothing to show." The tradesman tore his note to pieces: "I change my debt into a debt of honor." Fox thanked him and handed over the money, saying that Sheridan's debt was not of so long standing and that Sheridan must wait. But most of us know men who are less scrupulous than Fox.

    If I should die to-night
  And you should come to my cold corpse and say,
  Weeping and heartsick o'er my lifeless clay—
    If I should die to-night,
  And you should come in deepest grief and woe—
  And say: "Here's that ten dollars that I owe,"
    I might arise in my large white cravat
    And say, "What's that?"
    If I should die to-night
  And you should come to my cold corpse and kneel,
  Clasping my bier to show the grief you feel,
    I say, if I should die to-night
  And you should come to me, and there and then
    Just even hint 'bout payin' me that ten,
    I might arise the while,
    But I'd drop dead again.
Ben King.

From "Ben King's Verse."

JUST BE GLAD
Misfortunes overtake us, difficulties confront us; but these things must not induce us to give up. A Congressman who had promised Thomas B. Reed to be present at a political meeting telegraphed at the last moment: "Cannot come; washout on the line." "No need to stay away," said Reed's answering telegram; "buy another shirt."

  O heart of mine, we shouldn't
      Worry so!
  What we've missed of calm we couldn't
      Have, you know!
  What we've met of stormy pain,
  And of sorrow's driving rain,
  We can better meet again,
      If it blow!
  We have erred in that dark hour
      We have known,
  When our tears fell with the shower,
      All alone!—
  Were not shine and shower blent
  As the gracious Master meant?—
  Let us temper our content
      With His own.
  For, we know, not every morrow
      Can be sad;
  So, forgetting all the sorrow
      We have had,
  Let us fold away our fears,
  And put by our foolish tears,
  And through all the coming years
      Just be glad.

OPPORTUNITY
"I lack only one of having a hundred," said a student after an examination; "I have the two naughts." And all he did lack was a one, rightly placed. The world is full of opportunities. Discernment to perceive, courage to undertake, patience to carry through, will change the whole aspect of the universe for us and bring positive achievement out of meaningless negation.

  With doubt and dismay you are smitten
    You think there's no chance for you, son?
  Why, the best books haven't been written
    The best race hasn't been run,
  The best score hasn't been made yet,
    The best song hasn't been sung,
  The best tune hasn't been played yet,
    Cheer up, for the world is young!
  No chance? Why the world is just eager
    For things that you ought to create
  Its store of true wealth is still meagre
    Its needs are incessant and great,
  It yearns for more power and beauty
    More laughter and love and romance,
  More loyalty, labor and duty,
    No chance—why there's nothing but chance!
  For the best verse hasn't been rhymed yet,
    The best house hasn't been planned,
  The highest peak hasn't been climbed yet,
    The mightiest rivers aren't spanned,
  Don't worry and fret, faint hearted,
    The chances have just begun,
  For the Best jobs haven't been started,
    The Best work hasn't been done.
Berton Braley.

From "A Banjo at Armageddon."

SOLITUDE
Said an Irishman who had several times been kicked downstairs: "I begin to think they don't want me around here." So it is with our sorrows, our struggles. Life decrees that they belong to us individually. If we try to make others share them, we are shunned. But struggling and weary humanity is glad enough to share our joys.

  Laugh, and the world laughs with you;
  Weep, and you weep alone;
    For the sad old earth
    Must borrow its mirth,
  It has trouble enough of its own.
  Sing, and the hills will answer;
  Sigh, it is lost on the air;
    The echoes bound
    To a joyful sound,
  But shrink from voicing care.
  Rejoice, and men will seek you;
  Grieve, and they turn and go;
    They want full measure
    Of all your pleasure, But they do not want your woe.
  Be glad, and your friends are many;
  Be sad, and you lose them all;
    There are none to decline
    Your nectared wine,
  But alone you must drink life's gall.
  Feast, and your halls are crowded;
  Fast, and the world goes by;
    Succeed and give,
    And it helps you live,
  But it cannot help you die.
  There is room in the halls of pleasure
  For a long and lordly train;
    But one by one
    We must all file on
  Through the narrow aisles of pain.
Ella Wheeler Wilcox.

From "How Salvator Won."

UNSUBDUED
"An artist's career," said Whistler, "always begins to-morrow." So does the career of any man of courage and imagination. The Eden of such a man does not lie in yesterday. If he has done well, he forgets his achievements and dreams of the big deeds ahead. If he has been thwarted, he forgets his failures and looks forward to vast, sure successes. If fate itself opposes him, he defies it. Farragut's fleet was forcing an entrance into Mobile Bay. One of the vessels struck something, a terrific explosion followed, the vessel went down. "Torpedoes, sir." They scanned the face of the commander-in-chief. But Farragut did not hesitate. "Damn the torpedoes," said he. "Go ahead."

  I have hoped, I have planned, I have striven,
    To the will I have added the deed;
  The best that was in me I've given,
    I have prayed, but the gods would not heed.
  I have dared and reached only disaster,
    I have battled and broken my lance;
  I am bruised by a pitiless master
    That the weak and the timid call Chance.
  I am old, I am bent, I am cheated
    Of all that Youth urged me to win;
  But name me not with the defeated,
    To-morrow again, I begin.
S.E. Kiser.

WORK
"A SONG OF TRIUMPH"
When Captain John Smith was made the leader of the colonists at Jamestown, Va., he discouraged the get-rich-quick seekers of gold by announcing flatly, "He who will not work shall not eat." This rule made of Jamestown the first permanent English settlement in the New World. But work does more than lead to material success. It gives an outlet from sorrow, restrains wild desires, ripens and refines character, enables human beings to cooperate with God, and when well done, brings to life its consummate satisfaction. Every man is a Prince of Possibilities, but by work alone can he come into his Kingship.

  Work!
  Thank God for the might of it,
  The ardor, the urge, the delight of it—
  Work that springs from the heart's desire,
  Setting the brain and the soul on fire—
  Oh, what is so good as the heat of it,
  And what is so glad as the beat of it,
  And what is so kind as the stern command,
  Challenging brain and heart and hand?
  Work!
  Thank God for the pride of it,
  For the beautiful, conquering tide of it.
  Sweeping the life in its furious flood,
  Thrilling the arteries, cleansing the blood,
  Mastering stupor and dull despair,
  Moving the dreamer to do and dare.
  Oh, what is so good as the urge of it,
  And what is so glad as the surge of it,
  And what is so strong as the summons deep,
  Rousing the torpid soul from sleep?
  Work!
  Thank God for the pace of it,
  For the terrible, keen, swift race of it;
  Fiery steeds in full control,
  Nostrils a-quiver to greet the goal.
  Work, the Power that drives behind,
  Guiding the purposes, taming the mind,
  Holding the runaway wishes back,
  Reining the will to one steady track,
  Speeding the energies faster, faster,
  Triumphing over disaster.
  Oh, what is so good as the pain of it,
  And what is so great as the gain of it?
  And what is so kind as the cruel goad,
  Forcing us on through the rugged road?
  Work!
  Thank God for the swing of it,
  For the clamoring, hammering ring of it,
  Passion and labor daily hurled
  On the mighty anvils of the world.
  Oh, what is so fierce as the flame of it?
  And what is so huge as the aim of it?
  Thundering on through dearth and doubt,
  Calling the plan of the Maker out.
  Work, the Titan; Work, the friend,
  Shaping the earth to a glorious end,
  Draining the swamps and blasting the hills,
  Doing whatever the Spirit wills—
  Rending a continent apart,
  To answer the dream of the Master heart.
  Thank God for a world where none may shirk—
  Thank God for the splendor of work!
Angela Morgan.

From "The Hour Has Struck."

HOW DID YOU DIE?
Grant at Ft. Donelson demanded unconditional and immediate surrender. At Appomattox he offered as lenient terms as victor ever extended to vanquished. Why the difference? The one event was at the beginning of the war, when the enemy's morale must be shaken. The other was at the end of the conflict, when a brave and noble adversary had been rendered helpless. In his quiet way Grant showed himself one of nature's gentlemen. He also taught a great lesson. No honor can be too great for the man, be he even our foe, who has steadily and uncomplainingly done his very best—and has failed.

  Did you tackle that trouble that came your way
    With a resolute heart and cheerful?
  Or hide your face from the light of day
    With a craven soul and fearful?
  Oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce,
    Or a trouble is what you make it,
  And it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts,
    But only how did you take it?
  You are beaten to earth? Well, well, what's that!
    Come up with a smiling face.
