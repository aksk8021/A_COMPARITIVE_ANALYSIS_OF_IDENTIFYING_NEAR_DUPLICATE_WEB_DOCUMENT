*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WOMEN OF 'NINETY-EIGHT ***
Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™ concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.Was it a game? Do I know!… In any case, it amused me greatly, while perhaps frightening me a little.

"What are you doing here, my dear? A boy should not look in a mirror. »

Mom had found me standing in front of the three-sided mirror in her bedroom. She was quite surprised. My father, who was following her, heard my answer.

" But Mom ! I'm not looking at me, it's the other! »

Still had to explain. I was also very proud of my discovery: this second myself that I saw in profile, why did I have some trouble recognizing him?... and this third, seen from behind, I did not recognize him at all, I could have taken him for a foreigner…why?…since I recognized myself by looking straight at me!

Mum shrugged, Dad began to laugh, but he immediately provided explanations, as was his custom, and I understood that, seeing myself rarely in profile or three-quarters, in ordinary times, I could be surprised at my appearance in an ice cream game. Sure, it made it less fun, less scary, but still...

And, speaking to Mama as if I were no longer there, my father added in his deep voice, still tinged with irony:

“Nevertheless, there are people who claim to know their parents, their friends, the passer-by in the street, when a three-sided mirror is enough to make them strangers to themselves! »

Mom replied gently:

“There is a way to know others… to know one other among all.

— It's possible, it's possible, said my father, but I don't think so. You think of a mirror that deforms under the pretext of bringing closer. Is it safer than that of friendship or indifference?… Anyway, he said again, looking at me, your mother is right, refrain from contemplating yourself in mirrors; This is useless. Above all, abstain from contemplating others: you might think you know them! »

Why have I always remembered these few lines?

And now, let the time pass. I must tell you about Cigogne and the multiple reflection of Cigogne.

CHAPTER II
I had to repeat my call before Stork paid the slightest attention. He was standing under the boughs of the dead tree, his head as if outstretched at the end of a long, badly tied neck which stuck out in a somewhat comical fashion from the dirty blue uniform. Motionless, his arms dangling, his whole lean frame was carried on a single leg; the other remained bent following the acute pose of certain large birds. We gladly accused our comrade of thus preparing his balance for a future amputation. The face added to the singularity of the gesture: a bizarre silhouette where the flight of the chin and the forehead further accentuated the prominence of a curved, thin nose, squeezed between small eyes that were still blinking, and this nose seemed to bring forward the light blond skull. . To complete the caricature, glasses would have been needed, at least an eyeglass,

“Stork! I cried again; Stork! hurry up ! at a gallop! the lieutenant wants you. »

Slowly he turned around.

" Its good ! it's good, Serval! don't get hot! »

Without hurrying, he approached with long calm strides and finally jumped into the clay trench that led to the observatory.

Reading it again, I realize that this description of my friend is hardly honest. Portrait loaded? no, but incomplete, for sure. We must not imagine an innocent village, gaping at the moon and bewildered. Cigogne was full of finesse; his voice, intelligent and sensitive, somehow excused the strange ugliness, the grotesqueness of his features; finally his handshake, his look were not of an imbecile, far from it. In speaking to you about him, I will always try to do him justice, but what do you want! he had, perched under his tree, a very strange appearance, and why did he choose that tree, so thin, so twisted, so emaciated, a romantic ballad tree, where one would have willingly hanged oneself, on occasion? ?

" Well ! what did he tell you ? I asked when Cigogne returned a few moments later. You know, he didn't look happy, the little lieutenant! One of these days, you'll catch a nasty knock under your tree! Eh ? did you get yelled at? »

Cigogne smiled gently.

" Shout ? no, not precisely; he only told me that we shouldn't come out of the trench without reason, because it makes us see and a ball is quickly caught. He's wrong, Lieutenant. It's true for others, not for me; I would be missed: I'm too thin. »

I shrugged; Arguing is pointless with this boy.

He was contemplating a very simple flower, in a pretty mauve tone, picked on the embankment of the trench. The movement seemed to me full of elegance and unexpectedness. I took out my notebook and jotted it down with a few pencil strokes; the shoulder and neck line was really curious. It would please me so much to paint Stork's portrait one day; these sketches will help me.

Cigogne no longer spoke, he looked at his mauve flower, then, letting it fall:

"Our little lieutenant has good manners," he said, "and I like him, but he forgets himself sometimes." Didn't he call me "Stork"! He pulled himself together, he laughed, but still he called me "Stork." It will end up registering all by itself on my booklet: Roger Maxence, known as “Cigogne”. Gradually, under the grime, juice stains and ink stains, the first name will disappear. »

This supposition struck him as amusing; he amused himself by following her. His gaze, unstable and lively, jumped from right to left, never settling, which gave him a very particular expression of absence, simply absence, not flight… I cannot tolerate a look that flees; he scares me. When Cigogne wanted to look straight, Cigogne gave all his gaze, but when he was absent, his eyes wandered, while his mouth smiled gently, vaguely, without malice, as if apologizing for leaving.

He sat down next to me, on the little bench that we had had so much difficulty securing against the clay wall of the trench.

“Yes, old man,” I said to him, “as long as you are with us, this name will remain with you, for sure; it's a done deal. »

This name, I still remember the day fat Martin had found it, in September, at Ballersdorf, shortly before he was killed. — Cigogne was standing in front of a section of wall, his leg bent and his neck forward. Martin saw him and began to shout:

" Warning ! Warning ! he's going to fuck off, I tell you, the beautiful bird! She's going to fly away, the stork! »

It was really so well thought out that all the comrades burst out laughing. Cigogne was baptized on the spot and I immediately made my first sketch of the beautiful thin bird.

“…Never will we call you otherwise! You will have to do it! Last Saturday, talking to me about you, the captain said: "Your friend Cigogne", and five minutes ago the little lieutenant, despite his politeness, couldn't help...

— I understand, murmured Cigogne, but twenty-nine years ago, at the town hall of Gaillon (Eure), I was entered in the registers of civil status as being to name myself Roger Maxence.

"We probably made a mistake that morning," I replied gravely. Little mistake ! Do you ever write one word for another?

- Yes, my friend ... sometimes. »

Now he was wiping the inner leather of his helmet, thoroughly; he applied himself to this task.

"Stork," I asked, "just what color is your hair?"

- We never knew, he replied, since they are shaved. This shade, in civilian life, was ash blond; today, you have to find something else: peach blossom… reflection of oriental tobacco… In short, I have pink hair, but they say it's yellow, to be polite. »

Stork put on his helmet.

And now we are silent, we are straining our ears... A long thin whistle, a brutal burst, without echoes, raining dust, small pebbles...

"They're starting again," said Cigogne. Luckily, I don't have sensitive hearing! »
