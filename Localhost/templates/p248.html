Meadow landscape, bordered by willows and shrubbery, along which white flower groups with a distant blue view in the middle of the background. – In the foreground left, a small dune-like hill, which slopes more gently to the right than to the left, and merges into the horizontal line with a still half green branch of branches. — On the hill, to the right of a little rose-red hawthorn bush bending toward them, THE MAN and THE WOMAN, two newlyweds, slumbering in loose embrace, soberly dressed in gray-and-black tone, so that they, more or less like a darker spot, contrasting with the light green surroundings. – Daybreak.

THE MAN

rising from the embrace to a sitting position

The night is running out of my deaf senses
And plunder their wondrous delusions, —
The light comes through my eyes
And opens my lips.
With his right hand he awakens the woman, stretching out his left to the day.

See how the tender meadows awaken,
Where silence plays with silence, –
Still life seems meaningless –
The world is still just a picture.
The woman rises next to him.

But listen –! where the mist over
The dreamy bushes flees,
Rice from the light-become leaf
From every twig a living song!
THE WOMAN

sitting next to him, with clasped hands

My singing heart goes up with me
And holds his sweet images,
To praise the spring with it
In the choir that washes from the fields.
She looks up around her.

I feel the tears on my cheeks
Like dew on spring's sweet face,
When drops hang from my eyes,
Like mirrors of the dawn.
That's how I wear my dreams in the day
And I adorn our happy disposition – –
She spreads her arms wide and looks down before her, hesitating.

Thus I see May coming into the world – –
As if I myself had given birth to May!
SECOND SCENIC
Before the final lines, the mound has opened and MAY has emerged. – Sixteen-year-old girl in creamy white cross-dressing, small bare feet, a staff wound with pink eglantine in her hand, a wreath of the same flowers around her blond head. – As the man and the woman rise in wonder, Mei kneels before them on one knee. (Here, immediately further on, when the man and woman are standing, there must still be more than sufficient stage height above them, without this weakening the dominant vertical lines in the scene.)

THE MAN and THE WOMAN

holding hands, singing

Thus the day carries what we dream
The sweet night has promised –
Thus we see May come into the world,
As if he were from our own real!
Mei rises, while the man and the woman, where he begins to speak, kneel in their turn.

MAY

pointing around with his staff, singing

See – from the earth
And from heaven
And from your hearts
Was I born –
All over the earth
And all the heavens,
Through all hearts
Am I chosen!
Where I adorn the meadow,
Where I scatter my flowers
I make the world beautiful
I make the world happy
I teach her love –
See I'm May!
Where I sail up
Follow me a pair of wings,
All a host of heaven flies,
I make heaven happy,
Heaven and earth free –
See I'm May!
Where I bring you flowers
Where I mix your hearts,
Where I shed your tears
I melt you side by side,
Are you near my soul –
See I'm May!
THE MAN, THE WOMAN, MAY

standing together, singing

Hear the winds rushing
To tell everyone
That the May day (world) has awakened –
Meadow and willows cradles the heads
As if they believed it closely,
May their veils be drawn!
See his (my) breath takes everyone
Dew and tears fall,
From every heart blows the pressure –
See how people get wings
To soar like birds
In a heaven of happiness!
Sparkling with dew and tears
Does nature take on new paths,
And her lovely face
Blazes in radiant new splendor –
Waves from the bottomless darkness
To the bottomless light!
Mei walks softly, moving on a light background of the nascent music and going from left to right – he touches the flowers with his staff and plucks the children from them. — The man and the woman, standing next to each other, watch him hand in hand.

THE MAN

listening around

Hear it, hear it chattering
Out of the flower meadow!
All that lives wants to celebrate
For the little glad May.
Where he smiles in the round
A new button opens,
Where his bare feet were
A trembling song takes off.
We follow our child and king,
Lights in his luminous trail,
Guests in his wide house,
Vote in his singing choir!
He wants to go down the hill, but the woman puts her left hand on his shoulder and holds back his arm with the other.

THE WOMAN

Stay –! oh keep watching him from here —!
Do not descend into that bright garden –
All sweet things seem
Prefer our dreaming dune.
Bending over his shoulder, in the same attitude, by the way, watching Mei, who awakens the children.

How that white anemone
Before his breath blooms –!
It's like every fragrant crown
Until a live baby grows!
They both sink dreamily to a recumbent position, keeping their backs on their right arms.
And it is – as if our own
Heart disappears in sunshine –
Whether we ourselves bow down —
And we ourselves are flowers.
THIRD SCENIC
Mei, who has come completely to the left-back plan, disappears for a moment between the crops; — immediately after that a great cockchafer, with the chorus of THE KINDERS humming and tripping behind it, snorts in a wide arc to the right foreground. – The boys (like anemones) in one color, muted green, with a circle of six white petals around the head (doubles, the top ones being detached); the girls (like daisies) in one color, light green, with a circle of about twenty white (some pinkish) petals around the head (some loose).

THE CHILDREN

singing and tripping behind the cockchafer

How to buzz
We flowers
From bumblebee and bee!
We wave, we dust.
We grow and bloom
With May!
With May!
With May!
With the last words they keep moving their heads back and forth.

What mustaches
those beetles
And beetles so happy!
They shine, they dance
The days, and bear
The May!
The May!
The May!
As above.

The wings of the beetle open, from which Mei steps out; – touched by his staff, the beetle snorts upwards to the right. May turns to the man and the woman, the last of whom, rising slightly, rests on his right hand, while both look on in amazement.

MAY

pointing at the children, singing

See my guided –!
From all the happy
Flowering meadow
I bring you both
Serve blonde hair!
Meanwhile the children go hand in hand around the hill in a circle.

Develop for you
They all their beautiful
Hearts and Sprinkles
To adorn you
Their furry!
Meanwhile the children pluck petals from their wreaths and scatter them for the man and the woman.

picture of your life,
Dream image remained –
But that you
Was allowed to give a scent
Of love and happiness!
Meanwhile the children kneel in a semicircle in front of the man and woman, the former of whom also now lifts himself, leaning on his right hand, and the latter rises to a sitting position. After Mei's words a light music grows, to which the children dance before the hill. From the dance a wide singing circle then develops around the hill, which narrows each time until they rest on the hill by the third verse.

THE CHILDREN

singing around the hill

we smell
And cheer
Our heads with you!
Cared for us, fed us
With smells and sighs
The meadow!
The meadow!
The meadow!
With the last words they move their heads and the open hands, raised like chalices next to them, to and fro, stepping from one leg to the other.

And hurry there
And blows there
Near the wind –
There turning and blowing
We as leaves and seeds
Past!
Past!
Past!
With the last words they move their head and hands back and forth at the height of the waist and chest, and take steps with dream-drunk.

goes softly
with smiles
Our heads on their side –
Then: – silent – ​​tending
Let's dream
From May!
From May!
From May!
With the last verse they have snuggled up against the hill in a semicircle; — they still move their heads and drooping hands gently to and fro, bending asleep at the last lines, side by side and one above the other, so that it seems as if the hill is flowered. – Mei covers them with his staff to rest and goes slowly to the crop on the right. – The man rises dreamily from his semi-reclining position next to the woman; — with one arm around each other's waist and with their heads leaning against each other's shoulders, they look ahead.

THE MAN

It's as if my heart is remembering again
Those first touched spring days
And breathe in the happy gusts
Of a flowered youth.
THE WOMAN

It's as if my eyes are my youth
And saw all the stars again
Above the blossoming hedges
In all the ways of my joy!
She unbuckles her arm and looks around for Mei, who has come to the rear left, waking the youths.

But see how May through the green grass
The higher waxing wood is already approaching.
And from the shiny young leaves'
The bloom awakens a new crop!
THE MAN and THE WOMAN

rising and standing looking, singing

See! see how May a fresh load
From green lives is going to ascend –
And from a cloud of white twigs
Our victorious counter smile!
FOURTH SCENIC
Mei has gone from front right to back left along the crop, from which, as if taking them from the green wood, he has gathered some youngsters who follow him. Disappeared for a moment in the vegetation, Mei emerges with the procession of DE JONGEREN, after the first words of the sung couplet. — The young men wear short sleeves with long fitting trousers, light yellow, with a red handkerchief tied around the neck, red trims and buttons, red rose in the left buttonhole and behind the right ear, a green branch in the left hand, bare feet. The girls also in light yellow, with a red scarf around their shoulders, red buttons and trims, a wreath of red roses around the hair, in the right hand a branch of white blossoms, bare feet. – The youths on the left, the girls on the right, they go pair by pair, one hand, at arm's length, on each other's shoulder and with the other, in which the branch leaves or blossoms, also holding up a cord entwined with roses, which the two front ones hold only with both hands, and of which Mei, on the shoulders of the last pair standing, the ends as reins hold up. The procession advances in an arc, as above, and then swings to the right in front of the hill, so that the white branches are seen first, then the green branches. The woman hangs her left arm around the man's neck, who with his left hand holds her hand on his shoulder, while he wraps his right around the woman's waist and, leaning against him, lets her free arm hang down.

MAY

singing

I spread over tops
And bursting buttons
The blush of my blood,
By all the red
Blossoming bushes
My glow dims.
From barely bare,
Budding lottery tickets
I braid my procession,
My pink reins
Became wings
For their swift foot.
Except for the last pair, or the last two pairs, the others kneel on one knee; likewise Mei, who raises the reins above her head with her right hand, so that where each pair holds the rose cord a little higher, it forms a pure ascending line.

living of love,
giving you love,
I say hello
Animal closely awakening
Your both blazing
Less to meet!
Now the last pair is also kneeling, from which Mei gets down. The two rows, holding the rose cord before them like a hanging garland, bend forward in succession in two arcs, staying to one side behind the two foremost boys and girls, who form a quartet half forward, half turned towards the hill. – Mei remains second to none and sees to it.THE YOUTH

Row of youths, bending forward in singing

We are the juices that draw
From roots to waving crowns.
We are the gardeners – the gardens,
The fiery sprouting cuttings,
We are the veins
the leaves –
The tree!
Rei of girls, singing bending forward

We are the flowers that awaken
Whose wings fly into the sky,
We, who are the purpose of your days
Cover with blooming images,
We are the brides
The herbs -
The dream!
The quartet, singing

We braid into flaming tires
The bloom that filled your heart,
We drive to radiant deeds
Whose heart burned under roses,
We are the wings
The reins –
The bridle!
The pairs of the two choirs repeat the last verse, bowing to each other singing and interweaving the white blossoms through the green branches, after which the youths take over the branches and the youths and girls of the even pairs exchange places. At the last word they all lift the rose cordand lift the branch triumphantly, as before the quartet has done, now all the youths take the rope on their other side. The first girl from the rear wing now, after the youths and girls from the front wing have turned to the right, leads a round dance around the hill, the rose string thus swinging alternately between the dancers. From the dance they snuggle in a semicircle around the hill in front of the children. The man and the woman dreamily sink back to a sitting position, where he, holding the right hand around her waist, props himself up with the left side-back and she folds his hands in his lap. — When all rest, Mei, having thus far seen the spectacle from the side, seems to disappear into the right side crop.

THE CHILDREN

singing

†
But where is
de Mei
de Mei
The May –!
The music breaks off and the children seem to fall asleep again.

THE WOMAN

It is as if the May, gathering its brilliance,
Our hearts play like a harp
And, sailing through the meadows himself,
Our dreaming hunts from image to image.
THE MAN

It's like the chorus of summer messengers,
That slid round our dreaming army,
With the ebb of the night fled,
Comes back in the washing days.
They turn to May, whom they see coming. The man holds his left hand over his eyes, now propped up with the right from behind, while the woman, leaning against him, leans on the left hand and holds her right in her lap.

THE MAN and THE WOMAN

singing

And see -! May herself returns to us!
When a spring sweetness descends
He from a green cloud of tenderness,
Narrowly born foliage down – –
He made it to the first litter –!
FIFTH SCENIC
The man now props himself up, leaning slightly back, on his right arm, while the woman, bending forward to the procession, slides into his lap and leans over it on the left arm, resting her head on his chest. — From the crop in the foreground on the right emerges, as two successive pairs, the quartet of THE MARRIED, clad in loose girdled robes of purple color, edged with brown and adorned with some red flowers, the men without beards . They dance before the procession, each holding a bowl full of dark flowers in both hands. Immediately behind them comes Mei with three couples of married couples, in light brown robes, adorned with purple trim, and adorned with a few white flowers, the men bearded, who playfully pull a large nest along on green-lined cords. Mei in front only holds with the left hand the rightmost and longest cord — the married couple alternately have a shorter and shorter cord, which they hold with the right hand on the right shoulder and entwine with the left arm behind them. – The quartet stands side by side in pairs in front of the hill, but in such a way that the middle woman and man stand slightly in front of the extreme pair.

THE MARRIED

The quartet, singing

We are the crop of wider heavenly rays,
from higher sun,
That came down to the bottom of our hearts –
This is how we bring you full bowls
Animal life source.
They take the flowers from the bowls, which are filled with light-emitting crystals, and wrap the flowers around their heads like a wreath.

It is we, who after the teeming blows
from the morning hour
As a blessing of the glowing days of life
Wearing from the morning into the mild afternoon
Serve treasure of fire.
They kneel before the hill and set down the dishes.

Us who build their own a thousandfold
from the earth lifted,
Us are the sun-trembling farmlands,
To us is the creation – to us the joyful beholding
Love of life!
At the second line of the last couplet they rise again, and then on the following lines they spread their arms wide and fold them before themselves at the last words. The last couplet is then repeated as chorus by the other couples, after which the quartet moves behind the bowls and closer to the hill, and Mei steps forward between the quartet and the choir, holding his string to the woman standing next to him. throwing up.

MAY

speaking

Over faraway meadows,
Under heavenly skies,
Diving, soft nests shelter,
Wave nests to and fro,
Wave, they wave their tender
Brood between earth and heaven.
Over waving distant meadows,
In the sea of ​​wind and skies,
Soar, swift birds dive,
Dive, they dive down,
Bring food for their tender
Brood between earth and heaven.
Over waters, over meadows,
Through the misty skies,
Sail steady flights of birds,
Sail them, sail their soft feathers
To the waiting, hazy tender
End between earth and heaven.
Over faraway meadows,
Under heavenly skies,
If it descends, descends the soft feathers,
It descends from the nests,
All the tenderness in the world descends
Brood between earth and heaven.
SIXTH SCENIC
While Mei, at the last words of the last verse, takes up the first string again, from the nest rise the SEVEN VIRTUES and sit on the brink; — thereby the six married couples, each stepping more forward, spread the cords radially (so that Mei remains standing and the leading man comes to the foremost plan). — A general and sudden movement towards the nest develops with the music: — the quartet rushes there and kneels before the first ray (between May and the first woman); the man and the woman rise and want to descend the hill, the woman in front, whereupon she hesitates and, looking round, takes the man by the hand; the children wake up, run impetuously, among the youngsters still lying down, over the rose cord and kneel slightly behind the quartet in a semicircle in front of the nest,in which they move their heads and outstretched arms to the music (children's motif); the young men and girls in their turn rise and, with the rose cord raised, push past and over the kneeling children, in front of the nest, but still behind the quartet, where they also kneel. Then (all in rhythm with the music) the return movement begins just as suddenly: the youngsters lower their arms, rise and, turning around, seem to be pulling the laughing children with their string of roses at a speed towards the hill where everything is restored to its former state; the man and the woman, the latter of whom the first, clasping his hand with both of her hands, led the way in retreating backwards, likewise sink back, and now the man, leaning on the right arm over the woman's lap and the left arm hanging behind her beside her, with the head resting against her breast, and the woman propped up on both arms backwards. From the frisky return movement grows a softer music, in which the quartet, which had risen with it and had stopped wavering, begins to dance, each time approaching and retreating between the open rays of one of the virtues.

DANCE
Beginning with the foremost virtue (that is, before the outer cord), they end between the cords of Mei and the first woman, where now the two couples, one with their hands on each other's shoulders, the other kneeling on one knee, form a step. for virtue, which, turning on the edge of the nest, descends therefrom and strides to the hill before the four bowls. — The quartet follows virtue beyond the tightropes, while the first woman, turning to Mei until then, turns to the first man. – After virtue has spoken, the quartet likewise removes the next one, after which the first woman hands over her rope to Mei, virtue follows one step with the quartet, and stands on the second plane behind Mei, who steps forward . Continuing in this way, Mei finally stands in the foreground with the seven twirled cords in his hands, and the group of six married people in the second plane. †

The seven virtues are in a very light blue long and loose robe, including bare feet, each with a sheaf of flowers as an emblem, which can be soberly repeated in the hairdress. — After the first virtue has spoken, she takes her sheaf in her right arm and stands to the right of the rear bowl; after the second has spoken, the latter takes her sheaf in the left arm—both then take up the luminous bowl and step to the left.
